Classify as MIE or NOT_MIE and provide:
1. Classification (MIE/NOT_MIE)
2. Reasoning
3. Action type (if MIE)
4. Countries involved
5. Fatalities (if any)
```

**Example Response:**
```
1. Classification: MIE
2. Reasoning: This event meets the criteria for an MIE. The U.S. military conducted targeted airstrikes against a non-member state (Syria) utilizing a non-routine, governmentally authorized action â€“ military airstrikes. The targeting of "ISIS positions" constitutes a clear hostile action.

```

All prompts and responses in the system should adhere to this structure for consistency and clarity.
