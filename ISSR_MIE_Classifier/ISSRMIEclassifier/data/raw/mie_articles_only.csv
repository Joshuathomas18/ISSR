"Seeking Prize in East, Russia Floods a Ukrainian City With Troops",Invasions; Artillery; Military aid; Military reserves; Military personnel,"Enlarge this image.Russian forces are ratcheting up pressure on the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, pouring in waves of fighters to break Ukraine’s resistance and targeting supply lines in a bloody campaign aimed at securing Moscow’s first significant battlefield victory in months.Eleven months after Moscow launched its invasion, Bakhmut and the areas around it have become a center of intense fighting, with growing importance as both sides add forces to the battle. Russia intensified its effort to capture Bakhmut, which may be key to seizing the entire Donbas area, after months of bombardment beginning in the summer yielded few gains.“The situation is very tough,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a recent nightly address after meeting with military leaders. He said, “There are constant attempts to break through our defense.”Over the course of the war, firepower has proved critical to Russian gains, but the battle for Bakhmut has been different.Increasingly, Ukrainian fighters and analysts say, Moscow has been relying on a cruder tactic: trying to tip the city into its win column through the sheer weight of troop numbers. As a result, the Ukrainians say, Russian casualties in recent fighting in Bakhmut have been higher than in previous months.Part of Russia’s evolving strategy appears to be to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses with waves of soldiers, many drawn from President Vladimir Putin’s call-up of 300,000 men in September. That would be a departure from Moscow’s summer campaigns elsewhere in the Donbas, when artillery pounded cities for weeks before Russia launched a sustained ground offensive.In Bakhmut, Ukraine, too, has suffered heavy casualties. But the calculation for each side is not the same.Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Virginia, said the battle there has cost Russia more in human losses, because its fighters have often fought on foot, unsupported by armored vehicles. But while Ukraine’s losses may be fewer in number, he said on a recent episode of a military affairs podcast, War on the Rocks, they may be more painful.Many of the troops fighting for Russia around Bakhmut have been recruited from prison, and are less well trained than many of the soldiers Russia began the war with. Ukraine has mostly relied on national guard and other forces to hold its main defensive line in Bakhmut, with better-trained infantry units rushing in if those fighters are attacked or retreat.“Ukraine’s been forced to essentially trade higher-quality troops to hold Bakhmut against expendable Russian forces,” Kofman said on the podcast. That, he said, could “impede Ukrainian plans for an offensive down the line.”Bakhmut’s strategic value, military analysts say, is as a crossroads for some of the region’s highways. Capturing the city, which is in Donetsk province, would not guarantee that Moscow could make major advances in the east, but it would put Russian forces in better position to do so.Despite suffering setbacks elsewhere in eastern Ukraine and in the south, since last fall, Russian troops edging toward Bakhmut from the east have gradually squeezed the city. In January, they took the salt mining town of Soledar, 6 miles to the northeast.To the south, Ukrainian soldiers who recently left the front line said that a paved road that had been their main supply route into Bakhmut was now within range of Russian artillery and tanks, though still in Ukrainian hands. This leaves Ukraine relying on a road west to the town of Chasiv Yar, itself the target of frequent Russian attacks and harder to traverse.In past battles in the Donbas, Russian forces have often aimed to encircle a city first, leaving Ukraine to decide whether to expend costly resources to defend it. The pitched battle over Bakhmut suggests that Ukraine has overcome its qualms about engaging directly in a drawn-out fight for a city and is prepared to sustain losses in the hope that it can deplete its enemy’s strength still further.On Tuesday, fighting was also ranging elsewhere in Donetsk, in the town of Vuhledar.Moscow has moved from small-scale probing attacks around the town to a more concentrated assault, Britain’s Ministry of Defense said Tuesday, two days after Zelenskyy described Vuhledar as among the areas “under constant Russian attack.”The town, which had a prewar population of around 14,000, has been almost destroyed, but a Ukrainian military official emphasized on Tuesday that it was still under Ukrainian control.Military analysts say Ukrainian forces have been using their positions in and around Vuhledar to launch attacks on the region’s main railway hub in the occupied town of Volnovakha, less than 10 miles away, in a bid to weaken Russia’s resupply efforts. The head of Ukraine’s regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said Tuesday that there had been “intense fire” in the area.In the coming weeks and months, as both sides prepare for the offensives expected in the spring, Ukraine will be strengthened by new weaponry, including tanks and rocket systems supplied by the United States and other allies.On Tuesday, the French defense minister announced that his country would deliver 12 more Caesar howitzers to Ukraine and step up efforts to train Ukrainian soldiers, a significant increase in military aid from a country that had recently shown reluctance to part with more of its advanced artillery.And last week, the United States and Germany agreed, after a prolonged Ukrainian campaign, to provide battle tanks to Ukraine, among other military aid. Ukraine is also pressing its allies for jet fighters, although President Joe Biden has resisted sending Ukraine F-16s.But for now, the many new troops drafted in the fall are giving Moscow an advantage.

"Wagner Group May Have Committed War Crimes in Mali, U.N. Experts Say",Councils; Insurgency; War crimes; Atrocities; Rebellions; Minority & ethnic violence; Criminal investigations; Mercenaries; Murders & murder attempts; Human rights; Massacres,"Enlarge this image.DAKAR, Senegal — Mercenaries from the Wagner private military company may have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the West African nation of Mali along with the country’s military, United Nations experts said Tuesday, calling for an independent investigation into multiple instances of human rights abuses.“Since 2021, the experts have received persistent and alarming accounts of horrific executions, mass graves, acts of torture, rape and sexual violence, pillaging, arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances perpetrated by Malian armed forces and their allies” of the Wagner company, a group of independent experts, enlisted by the U.N. Human Rights Council to look into the group, said in a statement.Since the Kremlin-affiliated group began conducting operations with the Malian military, its mercenaries have been suspected of disproportionately targeting civilians, raising alarms among human rights groups and Western governments that have repeatedly denounced the group at the U.N. Security Council.African officials have also increasingly warned about the risk of destabilization and ethnic violence that the group could provoke.The United States named the Wagner military group as a significant transnational criminal organization in January, a move expected to discourage countries and institutions from doing business with the company.Wagner has drawn international attention in the past year as a vital adjunct to the Russian military, often more effective than the regular army, in the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has tried to cast himself and his mercenaries as an essential, brutal instrument of Russian military and foreign policy.In Africa, Wagner has been involved in at least a half-dozen countries, and in Mali Western officials estimate that around 1,000 Wagner operatives may be deployed alongside the country’s military, which has been fighting a jihadi insurgency that has swept the country’s north and center.But these tactics have come at a high price for local populations. Among other instances of human rights abuses, Wagner mercenaries and Malian soldiers have been accused of a massacre in the village of Moura, killing hundreds of people — including many unarmed captives and people who had no apparent ties to the insurgency — during a five-day siege last March.Those killings echo methods deployed in the Central African Republic, where the group also operates. “There’s a pattern of extreme violence carried out against civilians by Wagner working with the government, in Mali and in CAR,” said Sorcha MacLeod, chair of the United Nations Working Group on the use of mercenaries.The statement on Tuesday marks the first time that U.N. experts have publicly linked Wagner to atrocities committed in Mali, but in practice, their call for an investigation into the crimes is unlikely to yield significant results. Malian authorities have prevented U.N. investigators from accessing Moura or other sites of suspected human rights abuses.In their statement, the U.N. experts, who work for the Human Rights Council on a volunteer basis, warned that most of the victims of the crimes committed by the Malian military and Wagner operatives belonged to the Fulani minority.They argued that the ambiguity over the legal status of the Wagner group, as well as the reprisals against those daring to speak out, created a climate of terror for victims of the group’s abuses.“The first priority is to make sure that these types of atrocities stop,” said MacLeod, one of the statement’s authors. “The second priority is making sure that the victims and their families are given a voice and that they get access to justice.”The investigators stopped short of saying how many people suffered from human rights abuses in Mali, but Malian authorities received a more detailed set of allegations in January, which they have 60 days to respond to.These investigations are also unlikely to bring the Wagner group or any of its members before the International Criminal Court, for instance, since it has seldom dealt with mercenary organizations and prosecutes individuals rather than groups.Ornella Moderan, an associate researcher in the conflict unit of the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch research institute, said the experts’ statement would likely worsen an already deteriorated relationship between the government and the U.N. peacekeeping operation in the country, known as MINUSMA.“MINUSMA will pay the price for that kind of communications because they are the ones on the ground,” she said.Malian military officials and a representative for the Wagner company did not respond to requests for comment.Last week, Mali’s foreign minister, Abdoulaye Diop, said at the U.N. Security Council that his country would keep working with Russia, although he didn’t mention the Wagner group. He also rejected an offer by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres to reshuffle the peacekeeping mission.Several countries, including Britain, Egypt and Germany, announced last year that they would pull troops out of the mission, which will mean a loss of around 2,250 personnel — 17% of the current force.“Mali is one of the most difficult operating environments for peacekeeping,” Guterres said in an internal review of MINUSMA.

Ukraine and Russia Locked in 'Very Tough' Battle for Bakhmut,Invasions; Military reserves; Funerals; Humanitarianism; First aid; Cemeteries; Military personnel,"Enlarge this image.Russian forces are ratcheting up pressure on the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, pouring in waves of fighters to break Ukraine’s resistance and targeting its supply lines in a bloody campaign aimed at securing Moscow’s first significant battlefield victory in months.Eleven months after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion, Bakhmut and surrounding areas have become an epicenter of fighting, their importance growing as both sides have added forces to the battle. Russia and Ukraine are each believed to be preparing for larger offensives as warmer spring temperatures arrive, and as Kyiv’s Western allies try to rush armored vehicles and other heavy weapons to the front.Russia has intensified its effort to capture Bakhmut — which it sees as key to President Vladimir Putin’s objective of seizing the entire Donbas area in the east — after months of bombardment beginning in the summer yielded little progress. Civilians have streamed out of Bakhmut under Russian shelling, abandoning a city that before the war had a population of about 70,000, as the armies fought a series of battles in surrounding towns and villages that left heavy casualties on both sides.Despite suffering setbacks elsewhere in eastern Ukraine and in the south, since last fall, Moscow’s troops edging toward Bakhmut from the east have gradually squeezed the city. This month, Russian forces took the salt mining town of Soledar, six miles to the northeast. They have also cut off a road running north toward the town of Siversk.Bakhmut’s strategic value, military analysts say, is as a crossroads for some of the region’s highways. Capturing the city would not guarantee that Russia could make major advances in the east, but would put its forces in better position to do so.To the south, Ukrainian soldiers who recently left the front line said that a paved road that had been their main supply route into Bakhmut was now within range of Russian artillery and tanks, though still in Ukrainian hands. This leaves Ukraine relying on a road west to the town of Chasiv Yar, itself the target of frequent Russian attacks, and this road is harder to traverse.In past battles in Donbas, Russia has aimed to encircle a city first, leaving Ukraine to decide whether to expend costly resources to defend it. Military experts said that while the outcome of the battle for Bakhmut remained unclear, and while Ukraine could still manage to send in reinforcements to stabilize their defense of the city, a similar pattern appeared to be at play in the current fighting.Much of last year’s fighting around Bakhmut was spearheaded by Wagner, a Russian private military group that the United States last week designated as a transnational criminal organization and that U.N. officials accused on Tuesday of potential war crimes in Mali. Now, analysts say that regular Russian forces are increasingly prominent around Bakhmut and Vuhledar, a town about 60 miles southwest that has been virtually obliterated by shelling.“The situation is very tough,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine said in his nightly address Sunday after meeting with military leaders that focused on the fighting in Donetsk, one of two regions that make up Donbas.“Bakhmut, Vuhledar and other areas in the Donetsk region are under constant Russian attacks,” Zelenskyy said. “There are constant attempts to break through our defense.”Military analysts say that Ukrainian forces have been using their positions in and around Vuhledar to launch attacks on the region’s main railway hub in the occupied town of Volnovakha, less than 10 miles away, trying to weaken Russia’s resupply efforts. The Ukrainian head of the regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on the Telegram social media app Tuesday that there had been “intense fire” in Vuhledar and the surrounding area, without offering details.The fighting around Bakhmut has intensified in recent days, Ivan Tymochko, a serviceman and chairman of the country’s council of reservists, said on Ukrainian television.He said that Russian forces partly controlled the village of Sakko i Vantsetti, north of Bakhmut, and were attacking a sparkling wine factory on the eastern edge of the city and a meat processing plant, suggesting that they may be moving closer to the city. The battle lines are “constantly moving in one direction or another,” he said, adding that the situation around Vuhledar was under Kyiv’s control after heavy Russian losses.

"Mossad Conducted Drone Attack on Iran, Intelligence Officials Say:   [Foreign Desk ]",Drones; Missiles; Manufacturing; Research & development--R & D; Prime ministers; Intelligence services,"While the target's purpose is unclear, the city of Isfahan is a major center of Iranian missile production, research and development.TEL AVIV -- A drone attack on an Iranian military facility that resulted in a large explosion in the center of the city of Isfahan on Saturday was the work of the Mossad, Israel's premier intelligence agency, according to senior intelligence officials who were familiar with the dialogue between Israel and the United States about the incident.The facility's purpose was not clear, and neither was how much damage the strike caused. But Isfahan is a major center of missile production, research and development for Iran, including the assembly of many of its Shahab medium-range missiles, which can reach Israel and beyond.Weeks ago, American officials publicly identified Iran as the primary supplier of drones to Russia for use in the war in Ukraine, and they said they believed Russia was also trying to obtain Iranian missiles to use in the conflict. But U.S. officials said they believed this strike was prompted by Israel's concerns about its own security, not the potential for missile exports to Russia.The strike came just as Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken was beginning a visit to Israel, his first since Benjamin Netanyahu returned to office as prime minister. The director of the Central Intelligence Agency, William J. Burns, visited Israel last week, though it is not clear anything about the operation in Isfahan was discussed.American officials quickly sent out word on Sunday morning that the United States was not responsible for the attack. One official confirmed that it had been conducted by Israel but did not have details about the target. Sometimes Israel gives the United States advance warning of an attack or informs American officials as an operation is being launched. It is unclear what happened in this case.Isfahan is the site of four small nuclear research facilities, all supplied by China many years ago. But the facility that was struck on Saturday was in the middle of the city and did not appear to be nuclear-related.Iran made no effort to hide the fact that an attack had happened, but said it had done little damage. In statements, senior Iranian officials contended that the drones -- apparently quadcopters, a kind of aircraft with four separate propellers -- had all been shot down.Iran's official news agency, IRNA, reported on Sunday that the drones had targeted an ammunition manufacturing plant, and that they had been shot down by a surface-to-air defense system. It is not clear why Iran would build an ammunition production plant in the middle of a city of roughly two million people.Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, said at a news conference in Tehran on Sunday that ""a cowardly drone attack on a military site in central Iran will not impede Iran's progress on its peaceful nuclear program.""This is Israel's first known attack inside Iran since Mr. Netanyahu reassumed office, and it may indicate that he has adopted the strategy formed under his two predecessors and political rivals, Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid, who expanded Israeli attacks inside Iran.The quadcopters have become a signature of such operations.In August 2019, Israel sent an exploding quadcopter into the heart of a Hezbollah-dominated neighborhood in Beirut, Lebanon, to destroy what Israeli officials described as machinery vital to the production of precision missiles.In June 2021, quadcopters exploded at one of Iran's main manufacturing centers for centrifuges, which purify uranium at the country's two major uranium enrichment facilities, Fordow and Natanz. That attack was in Karaj, on the outskirts of Tehran. Iran claimed that there was no damage to the site, but satellite images showed evidence of significant damage.A year ago, six quadcopters exploded at Kermanshah, Iran's main manufacturing and storage plant for military drones.And in May 2022, a drone strike targeted a highly sensitive military site outside Tehran where Iran develops missile, nuclear and drone technology.The targets -- presumably including the military facility in Isfahan -- have been chosen in part to shake the Iranian leadership, because they demonstrate intelligence about the locations of key sites, even those hidden in the middle of cities.But the strikes also reflect a change in Israeli strategy made after Mr. Bennett became prime minister in June 2021. He lasted a year in the post.Mr. Bennett says in a forthcoming YouTube video shared with The New York Times that he decided to ""create a price tag"" and strike inside Iran in response to any attack on Israelis or Jews around the world. ""The Iranians beat us, and soldiers die on the border,"" Mr. Bennett says in the self-produced interview, while Iranian leaders ""sit quietly in Tehran and we do nothing to them.""It was not just the quadcopter attacks.After ""Iran tried to murder Israelis in Cyprus, in Turkey,"" Mr. Bennett says, the Revolutionary Guards Corps commander behind it ""was eliminated in Tehran."" He is referring to the assassination of Sayad Khodayee, who Israel claimed was a leader of a covert unit responsible for the abduction and killing of Israelis and other foreigners around the world.After Israel adopted the new strategy, Mr. Bennett says in the video, President Biden, during a meeting, made a ""sharp request"" that Israel inform the United States in advance ""of any action we take in Iran.""Mr. Bennett refused, he says.""There are things you do not want to know about in advance,"" he recalls telling the American president.The intelligence communities of Israel and the United States clashed on the issue in April 2021 after an operation by the Mossad to blow up bunkers at the Natanz enrichment site surprised the United States.Mr. Burns called his counterpart at the Mossad at the time, Yossi Cohen, to express concern over the snub. Mr. Cohen said that the belated notification was the result of operational constraints and uncertainty about when the Natanz operation would take place.Julian E. Barnes and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.Julian E. Barnes and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.Illustration This article appeared in print on page A10.",1.0
Battling Over Villages in East as Russia Strives to Encircle Bakhmut:   [Foreign Desk ],Invasions,"The area is a flash point in an offensive that Moscow views as crucial for its goal of seizing the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.Russian forces were wrestling for control of villages in eastern Ukraine near the city of Bakhmut over the weekend, the latest flash point in a battle that Moscow views as crucial for its push to seize the Donbas region in the east.Ukraine's general staff said on Sunday that its soldiers had repelled attacks on the small village of Blahodatne and several other settlements in the area. The statement came a day after Russia's Wagner group, a private military company that has conducted much of the fighting around Bakhmut on Moscow's behalf, claimed that its forces had captured Blahodatne, near a key supply line for Ukrainian forces.""Blahodatne is under our control,"" Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman and the head of the Wagner group, said on Saturday in a statement posted on a website for one of his companies. Russia's defense ministry has not confirmed the report and the claim could not be independently verified. Mr. Prigozhin has sought to cast his mercenaries as the most effective fighting force in the area and previously has claimed credit for battlefield advances ahead of Kremlin confirmation.Blahodatne lies between Soledar, a salt-mining town that Russian forces recently captured after weeks of intense fighting, and a road that runs north from the city of Bakhmut. The road serves as a crucial supply line for Ukrainian forces defending the city.Since the summer, Bakhmut has become a focal point of the fighting in eastern Ukraine and the target of Moscow's most significant attack. Moscow aims to encircle Bakhmut, cut off its supply routes and then force the city's defenders to withdraw. Despite some recent success, Russia's progress in the campaign has been grindingly slow and both sides have sustained heavy casualties.But since capturing Soledar earlier this month, Russian forces have stepped up shelling of the villages just to the west of it, including Blahodatne.Many civilians have followed a directive from the government in Kyiv to leave Donetsk, which is home to Bakhmut and one of the two areas that make up the Donbas region. Civilians who have stayed remain vulnerable to shelling and artillery attacks, with dozens killed in recent weeks. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of Donetsk's military administration, said on Sunday that five civilians had been killed a day earlier in the region.Almost a year after Russia launched invaded Ukraine, both sides are expected to launch renewed attacks in the coming months, as Kyiv puts to use the heavy weapons sent from allies and Russia deploys the huge numbers of men it drafted last year.Amid warnings that Russian forces were regrouping for an anticipated spring offensive, Ukraine's allies pledged new sophisticated weapons for the fight.Germany and the United States last week announced that they would send battle tanks to Ukraine, a move that came after weeks of tense back-channel negotiations between European and U.S. officials. But it may be months before the tanks rumble across the battlefield.Britain's defense ministry said on Sunday that the first Ukrainian soldiers had arrived in Britain for training on the Challenger 2 tanks that were promised earlier this month.In a speech on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine expressed gratitude for the latest promises of military aid, but said that his country's allies should still do more.""Ukraine needs long-range missiles, in particular, to remove this possibility of the occupiers to place their missile launchers somewhere far from the front line and destroy Ukrainian cities with them,"" he said in an overnight address.The city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, has faced repeated strikes in recent weeks. On Sunday, shelling there killed at least three people and wounded six others including a nurse, according to the regional military administration.""Today, the Russian army has been shelling Kherson atrociously all day,"" Mr. Zelensky said in his nightly address. ""Residential buildings, various social and transport facilities, including a hospital, post office, and bus station, have been damaged. Two women, nurses, were wounded in the hospital. As of now, there are reports of six wounded and three dead.""Russian forces have shelled Kherson on a near daily basis following their retreat from the city in November.The northeastern city of Kharkiv, recaptured by Ukraine in September, has regained much of its prewar population, but at just 25 miles from the Russian border remains well within striking distance. Late Sunday, the regional governor said a Russian missile strike on the city had killed at least one person and injured three.There have been signs that Russian forces are regrouping for a possible new offensive that could once again threaten Kharkiv. Ukrainian officials have said that а Russian tank division that had been deployed in Belarus had been diverted, possibly as part of a buildup of forces that could once again push into the Kharkiv region.But the Kremlin has set full control of the Donbas, where it has held considerable ground since 2014, as its immediate military objective. To that end it has mobilized tens of thousands of new recruits, though it has failed to achieve sweeping territorial gains in the region in recent months.Military authorities in Ukraine say that Moscow's advances in the Donbas region have come at the expense of heavy casualties, not least among the ranks of the Wagner private military company. Some analysts of the conflict say that Wagner's failure to secure Bakhmut, even after months of fighting, has dimmed its star in some Russian military circles.The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said in a report on Saturday that conventional Russian forces were ""likely replacing exhausted"" Wagner forces ""to maintain the offensive in Bakhmut"" after the capture of Soledar.But Russia might be less willing to sustain heavy losses among regular conscripts than among Wagner fighters, the report said. ""The Russians' ability to execute large-scale rapid offensives on multiple axes this winter and spring is thus very questionable,"" the report said.Photograph Viktor, a 62-year-old Ukrainian soldier, awaited transfer from a hospital where the wounded are brought from fighting in the Donbas region, which includes Bakhmut.

Russia and Ukraine Battle for Control of Villages Near Bakhmut,Invasions; Humanitarian aid; Humanitarianism; War; Violence; Military personnel,"Enlarge this image.Russian forces were wrestling for control of villages in eastern Ukraine near the beleaguered city of Bakhmut over the weekend, the latest flashpoint in a battle that Moscow views as crucial for its push to seize the whole of the eastern region of Donbas.Ukraine’s general staff said Sunday that its soldiers had repelled attacks on the small village of Blahodatne and several other settlements in the area. The statement came a day after Russia’s Wagner group, a private military company that has conducted much of the fighting around Bakhmut on Moscow’s behalf, claimed that its forces had captured Blahodatne.“Blahodatne is under our control,” Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessperson and the head of the Wagner group, said Saturday in a statement posted on a website for one of his companies.Russia’s defense ministry has not confirmed the report, and the claim could not be independently verified. Prigozhin has sought to cast his mercenaries as the most effective fighting force in the area and previously has claimed credit for battlefield advances ahead of Kremlin confirmation.Blahodatne lies between Soledar, a salt-mining town that Russian forces recently captured after weeks of intense fighting, and a road that runs north from the city of Bakhmut. The road serves as a crucial supply line for Ukrainian forces defending the city.Since the summer, Bakhmut has become a focal point of the fighting in eastern Ukraine and the target of Moscow’s most significant offensive.Moscow aims to encircle Bakhmut, cut off its supply routes and then force the city’s defenders to withdraw. Despite some recent success, Russia’s progress in the campaign, which began over the summer, has been grindingly slow, and both sides have sustained heavy casualties in intense fighting.But since capturing Soledar earlier this month, Russian forces have stepped up shelling of the villages just to the west of it, including Blahodatne.Many civilians have followed a directive from the government in Kyiv to leave Donetsk, which is home to Bakhmut and one of the two regions that make up the Donbas region. Civilians who have stayed remain vulnerable to shelling and artillery attacks, with dozens killed in recent weeks. Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of Donetsk’s military administration, said Sunday that five civilians had been killed a day earlier in the region.Almost a year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, both sides are expected to launch renewed offensives in the coming months, as Kyiv puts to use the heavy weapons sent from the West and Russia deploys the huge numbers of men it drafted last year.Amid warnings that Russian forces were regrouping for an anticipated spring offensive, Ukraine’s allies pledged new sophisticated weapons for the fight.Germany and the United States last week announced that they would send battle tanks to Ukraine, a move that came after weeks of tense back-channel negotiations between Western officials. But it may be months before the tanks rumble across the battlefield.Britain’s defense ministry said Sunday that the first Ukrainian soldiers had arrived in Britain for training on the Challenger 2 tanks that were promised earlier this month.In a speech Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine expressed gratitude for the latest promises of military aid but said that his country’s allies should still do more.“Ukraine needs long-range missiles, in particular, to remove this possibility of the occupiers to place their missile launchers somewhere far from the front line and destroy Ukrainian cities with them,” he said in an overnight address.The city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, has faced repeated strikes in recent weeks. On Sunday, shelling there killed at least three people and wounded six others, including a nurse, according to the regional military administration.“Residents of Kherson, go to the nearest shelter or stay at home,” it said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. “In no case stay outside.”Russian forces have shelled Kherson on a near-daily basis following their retreat from the city in November.But the Kremlin has set full control of the Donbas, where it has held considerable ground since 2014, as its immediate military objective. To that end it has mobilized tens of thousands of new recruits, although it has failed to achieve sweeping territorial gains in the region in recent months.Military authorities in Ukraine say that Moscow’s advances in the Donbas region have come at the expense of heavy casualties, not least among the ranks of the Wagner private military company. Some analysts of the conflict say that Wagner’s failure to secure Bakhmut, even after months of fighting, has dimmed its star in some Russian military circles.The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said in a report Saturday that conventional Russian forces were “likely replacing exhausted” Wagner forces “to maintain the offensive in Bakhmut” after the capture of Soledar.But Russia might be less willing to sustain heavy losses among regular conscripts than among Wagner fighters, the report said.“The Russians’ ability to execute large-scale rapid offensives on multiple axes this winter and spring is thus very questionable,” the report said.

"In Kharkiv, a Stillness That May Be Short-Lived:   [Foreign Desk ]",Invasions; War; Heat; Neighborhoods,"KHARKIV, Ukraine -- The trenchworks along the northern edge of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, have begun to erode and fill with refuse, and the soldiers who used them to defend the city from the Russian onslaught have now departed to other fronts. Today, the fortifications are manned only by mannequins in military uniforms, including one, perhaps too optimistically, wearing a blue United Nations peacekeeping helmet.All around, the blackened and pockmarked high-rise apartment buildings testify to the ferocity of the fighting that occurred here in Ukraine's northeast in the early months of the war. But there is a stillness now, and residents are not quite sure how to interpret it.Ukrainian forces expelled the Russian military from almost the whole region in a blitz offensive in September that took much of the world by surprise. Not only did it inject new vigor into the Ukrainian war effort, but it also gave Kharkiv some breathing space.But the Ukrainians could push their enemies only so far. The border is about 25 miles from the city center, well within range of many Russian weapons.Kateryna Vnukova, 19, an economics student in Kharkiv, said that from her 12th-floor apartment in the city center, she can sometimes see shelling off in the distance.""I think now it's all calm and quiet in Kharkiv, but it's not calm and quiet,"" said Ms. Vnukova, who was out for a twilight walk last weekend, but was trying to get home before sundown. ""Normally when it gets dark, the devils come out, the ones there, over the border.""Now there are signs that Russian forces are regrouping for a possible new offensive that could once again threaten the city. On Monday, Vadym Skibitsky, the deputy head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency, told a Ukrainian news outlet that а Russian tank division that had been deployed in Belarus had been diverted, possibly as part of a buildup of forces that could once again push into the Kharkiv region.As Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches its first anniversary, Kharkiv has become a showcase of Ukrainian military success, but also of its limitations. For the past four months, residents have slowly trickled back into the city; power, heat and gas have been restored to most dwellings; there is traffic in the streets and there are patrons in the restaurants and cafes, though many of their windows remain broken and boarded up.Kharkiv's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, boasted that the city population had doubled since the first months of the war to about 1.1 million people (from a prewar population of 1.4 million) and that construction was underway to repair some of the 4,500 homes severely damaged in Russia's failed effort to take the city. Though mindful that the fighting is far from over, the mayor is working with the acclaimed architect Norman Foster on a postwar development plan.""We have to return Kharkiv residents to the city, but they can't come back and find themselves in a broken shell,"" he said. ""The general plan for the development of London in 1943 was done under bombardment by the Fascists.""But his development plan does not envision a speedy end to the conflict, or a total respite for Kharkiv. Among its provisions is a requirement that all newly built apartment blocks include underground parking lots that can double as bomb shelters.While it is quieter in Kharkiv than it has ever been since the invasion began, to residents, the war does not seem all that far away. The air-raid sirens sound constantly, and Ukrainian fighter jets roar through the air on patrol. On a recent night, several burly men in camouflage uniforms and balaclavas entered an upscale Japanese restaurant to hand out draft notices to Ukrainian men, sending the waiters into hiding.Last weekend, a contingent of Ukrainian troops from the Kharkiv region was taking advantage of the relative quiet to hone their rifle skills and their combat maneuvers in a wooded training ground just outside of town.""We have some time, and we're not going to waste it,"" said their instructor, a 22-year-old lieutenant with the call sign Clover.Russian artillery and rockets pound outlying villages in the region, and heavier missiles regularly hit the city center as Russian forces continue to target critical infrastructure like power plants.An enormous thermal power plant has been attacked several times, including with an Iranian-made Shahed explosive drone. The attacks have blown a gigantic hole through the roof, broken all of the windows, and knocked out heating to the city for several days. Inside, workers keep equipment from freezing with large, gas-fed fire pits and plastic tarps to divide the huge boiler room into more easily warmed sections. The plant's main boiler remains mangled and out of commission, but workers have managed to keep the plant churning out heat with auxiliary boilers.No workers have been killed in the strikes.""Thankfully, God is protecting us,"" said Yevhen Kaurkin, the plant's technical director.The war is closer still in the northern neighborhood of Saltivka, which was ravaged by the fighting and remains a difficult place to live despite efforts to improve conditions. On a recent day, city workers in fluorescent green vests were raking leaves in front of a bombed-out building that looked like a wobbly tower of Jenga blocks.Because so many people have been killed while waiting at bus stops, the city has installed fortified concrete shelters designed to protect people from shelling. Each has a monitor inside showing a live feed of the street so that people can know when the bus arrives.During the worst of the fighting, hundreds of people sheltered in the musky basement of Kharkiv Municipal Gymnasium No. 172. Though no one now shelters there full time, hundreds still come back daily for warm meals prepared in the school's kitchen.The school's director, Oleksandra Utkina, who also teaches mathematics, said she was excited for the day when children could return, but acknowledged that would not happen anytime soon.""We need for them to stop shooting first,"" she said.Nearby, at a large army tent set up amid burned-out apartment blocks, a few locals were warming themselves and watching a soccer game on a large flat-screen television. Svitlana Kaminska, 62, was heating her dinner in a microwave. Though most residents of Saltivka left the neighborhood during the most intense fighting, Ms. Kaminska stayed, sheltering in her windowless corridor as rockets hit her apartment building again and again. In the entire building, she is the only one who remained.Just to get to her front door, she has to scramble over mounds of debris and avoid falling into a large hole in the sidewalk where a shell landed in August. Some of the apartments in her building have been gutted by fire, and none have windows. Successive blast waves have knocked in some of the interior walls and punched out the steel frames of the elevator doors.Ms. Kaminska's existence is grim. She has rigged up a small space heater and a lamp to a thin white extension cord plugged into the only working plug in the building, at the bottom of the stairs, and has managed to heat her home to a few degrees above freezing. Only the audio on her television is working.But these discomforts do not bother her much, she said.""For me, the most frightening thing is not the cold or the fact that I'm alone here, but heaven forbid the possibility of another attack,"" she said. ""Doesn't anyone have influence over this Russia, to quiet them down a little?""Natalia Yermak contributed reporting.Natalia Yermak contributed reporting.Photograph A resident towing water to his home in the battered neighborhood of Saltivka in Kharkiv, Ukraine, where it's still difficult to live despite efforts to improve conditions.; Top, an abandoned Russian tank in the forest of Ruski Tyshky, a village north of Kharkiv.

Fight Over Supply Routes May Signal an Offensive:   [Foreign Desk ],Invasions; Assaults; Military strategy,"While the heaviest fighting is still around the city of Bakhmut, in recent days Russian forces have stepped up assaults on a strategic town farther to the south.KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian troops mounted a fierce assault on Ukrainian forces on Saturday in an effort to dislodge them from critical positions in eastern Ukraine, with Moscow seeking to protect vital supply routes and both armies jockeying for position in anticipation of new offensive campaigns.Russia has been trying for months to break through well-fortified Ukrainian defensive positions across the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, throwing wave after wave of soldiers into the fight and suffering heavy casualties but making few territorial gains.Those efforts have taken on greater urgency as Western and Ukrainian officials warn that Moscow plans to launch a large-scale assault aimed at regaining the upper hand, nearly a year after Russia invaded Ukraine. Military experts and Western officials say they also believe that Ukraine will try to mount an offensive of its own to drive Russia out of occupied areas in the east.""It is no secret that they are preparing for a new wave by Feb. 24,"" Oleksiy Danilov, the head of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told Radio Liberty on Friday, referring to Russian forces and what will be the first anniversary of their full-scale invasion. Moscow's immediate goal, he said, is to capture the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions and then ""to completely go beyond the borders of the regions.""President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia this month abruptly replaced the top commander of Russia's war effort with Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, who American officials believe secured the top job by vowing to go on the attack, with an initial goal of gaining ground quickly in the east.The epicenter of the fighting in eastern Ukraine since the summer has mainly been around the city of Bakhmut, which has taken on a symbolic significance that military analysts say outweighs its strategic importance.But in recent days Russian forces have stepped up their assaults on the town of Vuhledar, just over 90 miles south of Bakhmut. It sits at the intersection of the eastern front in the Donetsk region and the southern front in the Zaporizhzhia region, a location that makes it well positioned for resupplying Russian forces moving between the two fronts.Military analysts say that Ukrainian forces have been using their positions in and around Vuhledar to launch attacks on the region's main railway hub in the occupied town of Volnovakha, less than 10 miles away, threatening Russia's resupply efforts. Trains are essential for moving heavy equipment and large troop formations across the battlefield, so the more Ukrainian forces can cut off the lines running from Russia to southern Ukraine, the more they can isolate Russia's forces in the region.In that light, pushing the Ukrainians back from Vuhledar would help Russia secure the train lines. It ""guarantees Russia a stable supply of the southern part of the occupied territories,"" according to an analysis issued on Saturday by the Conflict Intelligence Team, an independent group that analyzes open-source intelligence.Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-appointed leader of the Donetsk region, said that an eventual capture of Vuhledar by Russian forces ""solves many problems,"" and predicted that the town ""may become a new, very important success for us,"" according to Russian news reports on Friday.Ukrainian officials have rejected recent reports from Kremlin proxy officials and Russian military bloggers of advances in the area. Col. Sergei Cherevaty, the spokesman for Ukraine's eastern military command, reported fierce fighting around Vuhledar but said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces had thwarted the Russian attacks.Neither the Russian nor the Ukrainian claims could be independently verified. Britain's Defense Intelligence Agency said on Friday that Russian military sources were probably ""deliberately spreading misinformation in an effort to imply that the Russian operation is sustaining momentum.""In his overnight address to the nation on Friday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called the intensity of the fighting around Bakhmut and Vuhledar ""extremely acute"" and destructive.""The occupiers are not just storming our positions -- they are deliberately and methodically destroying these towns and villages around them,"" he said.The intense fighting has led to numerous casualties on both sides as the Ukrainian and Russian militaries pound away at one another with artillery and missiles. At a military hospital near Bakhmut on Saturday, there were at least eight bodies of Ukrainian soldiers in the morgue, and the sound of incoming and outgoing artillery shells was incessant.On Saturday evening, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that Ukrainian forces had used an American-made multiple rocket launcher known as HIMARS to strike a hospital in the Russian-controlled Ukrainian region of Luhansk, killing at least 14 people.But Ukrainian officials said the building, located near the town of Novoaidar, was actually a division headquarters of the Russian military. The building was equipped with an antenna and special communications equipment, which is not typically found at a hospital, said a senior Ukrainian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.The official said the Ukrainian forces spent several days trying to determine whether the building was in fact a headquarters and whether they would be in violation of international law in case of an attack. The decision to fire was made only after precise confirmation, including photos and videos of the communications equipment installed there, the official said.The devastating toll on civilians from those attacks was evident on Saturday morning in the village of Kostyantynivka, roughly 15 miles southwest of Bakhmut, where a Russian missile strike killed three people and wounded 14 others.In the courtyard of a residential neighborhood, the body of a man lay sprawled on the ground amid wreckage and debris. His mother knelt over him, sobbing and stroking his side. Another corpse was covered by a sheet, splayed out near a wheelbarrow that the man had likely been pushing at the moment of impact.A woman, smoking on a balcony above the courtyard, cried and shouted out to no one in particular: ""I hate you all.""Marc Santora reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Michael Schwirtz from Kostyantynivka.Marc Santora reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Michael Schwirtz from Kostyantynivka.Photograph Ukrainian security forces collected fragments on Saturday after a deadly strike on a residential building in Kostyantynivka, in eastern Ukraine.

Annexed Area Will Soon Use Moscow Time:   [Foreign Desk ],Time zones; Alliances,"Russia, which has many time zones, is seeking to integrate the regions after illegally annexing them in September.Russia will switch four occupied areas of Ukraine to Moscow's time zone, it said Friday, a shift that carries symbolic meaning far heavier than its practical effect as it highlights the Kremlin's attempt to solidify control of the illegally annexed regions.Russia's Ministry of Industry and Trade said in a statement that the four regions -- Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia -- would switch to Moscow time ""in the near future"" as part of a process of ""gradual synchronization of Russia's legislature."" The regions are one hour behind Moscow now.But Moscow has long had a particular focus on time zones, cherishing its own 11 divisions as a source of national pride. There is no rational justification for its having that many, experts say, and their multiplicity can lead to absurdities, particularly in its far east. When it is noon in Vladivostok, for example, it is 11 a.m. in Tokyo, even though it lies farther east.So it was perhaps predictable that the Kremlin would seek to manipulate time zones in Ukraine as part of its ""Russification"" campaigns over the course of the war. These have involved forcing teachers to use a Russian curriculum, replacing local officials with occupation appointees, substituting the Ukrainian currency with the ruble and issuing Russian passports.Moscow illegally annexed the regions of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia in September, despite international condemnation and even as parts of the areas remained under Ukrainian control. Since then, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has been urging his government officials to speed up the process of integrating the regions into Russia's economic, legal and social infrastructure.""Russia needs to gain a solid foothold there,"" he said in December at a meeting with young Russian scientists. ""It means working on those territories and with those people so that the people feel the benefit of the accession to Russia.""However, it promises to take far more than shifting to Moscow time for Russia to establish that perch in Ukraine, as the front lines continue to shift and few Russian officials, teachers or other municipal workers are willing to risk their lives by working there. Russia has had to resort to offering higher salaries for teachers in the regions, and several officials there have been targeted in attacks by pro-Ukrainian fighters.On Thursday, Mikhail Mishustin, Russia's prime minister, said that the four regions would be part of the Russian social insurance system, which issues payments to workers when they fall ill or become disabled. And on the same day, Russia's Parliament approved a bill on integrating schools and universities in the regions into the Russian education system.It remains to be seen what contribution the time switch will make in the effort to win over Ukrainian hearts and minds, when even Russians themselves are resistant to such changes. In 2009, Dmitri A. Medvedev, then Russia's president, suggested eliminating some of Russia's time zones as part of a broader modernization effort for Russia. His proposal went nowhere.Illustration This article appeared in print on page A9.",1.0
Strikes Kill 12 in Ukraine as Russia Again Tries to Pull Plug on Electricity:   [Foreign Desk ],Missiles; Cities; Armed forces,"Russia's forces once again pounded energy infrastructure and other civilian sites, a day after the United States and Germany pledged to send dozens of tanks to Ukraine.KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia fired dozens of missiles at Ukrainian cities on Thursday, piercing snow clouds and air defenses to kill at least 12 people across the country, in the Kremlin's campaign to punish civilians while its army fights in Ukraine's east.The wave of strikes came a day after Germany and the United States pledged to send dozens of battle tanks to Ukraine, a significant step up in Western military support. Ukraine managed to shoot down 47 of the 55 missiles, according to its Air Force command, including 20 in the area around the capital, Kyiv.But a variety of Russian strikes still killed 11 people across 11 regions, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. Another 11 people were wounded, and 35 buildings were damaged, it said.A 12th civilian was killed later in the day when a Russian rocket hit a village council building in Kochubeivka, a tiny community in the Kherson region, a military official said on Telegram.As it has for months, Russia appeared to target Ukraine's energy grid in subfreezing winter weather. ""The main goal is energy facilities providing Ukrainians with light and heat,"" Ukraine's prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in a post on Telegram.Since October, Russia has launched more than a dozen major waves of missiles and drones on Ukraine's energy facilities, as well as many smaller attacks, in a campaign to impair the power supply and leave civilians without power, heat and light over winter.The barrages have sometimes come after Ukrainian successes, like its fall campaigns in the northeast and the south, but have continued as the pace of fighting has slowed to a grueling battle of attrition in the east and south.The missile strikes have often landed in residential areas, as well, sometimes to devastating effect, as when more than 40 people were killed in a strike on an apartment building in Dnipro, in central Ukraine.Large booms shook Kyiv about 10 a.m. local time on Thursday, sending residents fleeing into subway shelters and basements. The mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said one person had been killed and two wounded when a projectile hit a building in the city's south.At least one blast could be heard on camera, interrupting an interview that a member of Ukraine's Parliament was giving to the broadcaster Sky News. ""Where was it?"" a woman asks in the video, as the lawmaker and journalist stand amid destroyed Russian tanks. ""Not far away.""Three people were killed in a Russian strike on infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia, the state prosecutor general's office said on Telegram. There were also reports of missile strikes in the Vinnytsia region in western Ukraine and outside the port city of Odesa, causing ""massive power outages"" there, according to Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba.France's foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, was in Odesa on Thursday to meet with Mr. Kuleba -- diplomatic talks that were literally forced underground by the Russian strikes.""Thanks to a Russian missile, I experienced my 1st diplomatic bilateral meeting in a shelter,"" Ms. Colonna tweeted on Thursday, sharing a photo of the ministers at a table in a bare room. ""Coffee was warm, merci!""Mr. Kuleba, who noted that Odesa's historic center was designated a world heritage site in danger this week by UNESCO, said on Twitter that the meeting was ""probably the first time in history when Foreign Ministers hold talks in the basement of an Opera House.""The U.N. agency's designation gives the city, which was conquered in the late 18th century by the Russian Empire and given the name Odesa by the empress Catherine the Great, ""access to reinforced technical and financial international assistance,"" UNESCO said. ""Ukraine may request this to ensure the protection of the property and, if necessary, assist in reconstruction if attacked.""Ms. Colonna said that the ministers had discussed French support for Ukraine, saying, ""Our assistance will continue in all areas and for as long as necessary.""Mr. Kuleba -- who joked that the French minister was ""the Catherine I'm pleased to see in Odesa"" -- has pressed Ukraine's supporters in Europe and the United States to significantly increase their military aid. Not long after Germany and the United States announced they would send dozens of battle tanks to Ukraine, he called for ""Western-type fighter jets.""Ukrainian officials have argued that such warplanes would help them defend against Russia's missile volleys.For the past week, Russia's Air Force has been conducting exercises north of Ukraine in Belarus, keeping Ukraine on heightened alert. Countrywide air attack sirens have sounded each time Russian planes take to the air.Overnight, according to Ukraine's Air Force Command, Ukraine's air defenses shot down 24 Iranian-made Shahed exploding drones.Both the United States and Germany have pledged Patriot air-defense missile batteries to Ukraine, and the U.S. military is training Ukrainian troops in Oklahoma on how to use the weapon, which is the most advanced American ground-based air-defense system.The Biden administration has significantly increased its military aid to Ukraine over the past year, gradually expanding the array of arms it has agreed to provide to include HIMARS rocket artillery systems last summer, Stryker armored fighting vehicles, Patriot missiles and, now, M1 Abrams tanks. Britain has promised to send some of its Challenger 2 tanks, while Germany has agreed to supply some of its Leopard 2 tanks and to allow other countries to give theirs to Ukraine.Military experts and Western officials say they believe that Ukraine and Russia will both attempt offensives in the spring, as Kyiv puts to use the heavy weapons sent from the West and Russia deploys the huge numbers of men it drafted last year.""The spring and summer look like they're going to be fairly decisive,"" said Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va. Speaking on the podcast ""War on the Rocks"" this week, Mr. Kofman said that in its next offensive, Ukraine would have ""a strong opportunity to show that it can continue retaking territory.""But unlike its past offensives in the Kharkiv region to the northeast and the Kherson region to the south, ""the next offensive comes with risk,"" he said. ""If it's not successful, Ukraine faces the real danger of a counteroffensive.""Michael Schwirtz reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Alan Yuhas from New York.Michael Schwirtz reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Alan Yuhas from New York.Photograph Waiting to receive aid in Oleksandrivka, a village in the Kherson region.

U.S. Copter Raid Kills an ISIS Leader in Somalia:   [Foreign Desk ],Leadership; Military withdrawals; Counterterrorism,"Officials said the man helped facilitate a network of ISIS affiliates around the world.WASHINGTON -- U.S. Special Operations commandos killed a senior Islamic State leader in an early-morning helicopter raid in a remote area of northern Somalia on Thursday, U.S. officials said.The Pentagon identified the leader as Bilal al-Sudani. American officials said he was operating in Somalia but that his influence as one of the terrorist group's top financial operatives extended across Africa, into Europe and even to the ISIS branch in Afghanistan that carried out the August 2021 bombing at Kabul's international airport that killed 13 American service members.In a statement on Thursday, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said Mr. al-Sudani ""was responsible for fostering the growing presence of ISIS in Africa and for funding the group's operations worldwide, including in Afghanistan.""Biden administration officials said no civilians were injured or killed in the raid. They also said none of the American troops involved were hurt, although one was bitten by a dog they had brought with them.During a call with reporters Thursday afternoon, a senior administration official described Mr. al-Sudani as ""a key operative and facilitator for ISIS' global network."" The official said the operative was killed along with 10 other Sudanese Islamic State associates.The raid took place in a remote mountainous cave complex in the Puntland region of northern Somalia, months after American spy networks detected Mr. al-Sudani's hidden headquarters and monitored the location to study his movements.The senior administration official said that the Special Operations troops had been prepared to capture Mr. al-Sudani but that the response from his associates when American troops arrived at their cave complex ""resulted in his death.""Nonetheless, based on previous raids, the commandos almost certainly scooped up laptop computers and hard drives, cellphones and other information from Mr. al-Sudani's hide-out that could provide tips for future counterterrorism operations.The fact that the Pentagon sent commandos to kill or capture Mr. al-Sudani -- a decision that required President Biden's approval this week -- rather than using a less risky drone operation indicated his significance.One senior administration official said there was no one else in the Islamic State's global constellation of operatives who rivaled Mr. al-Sudani in his ability to receive and distribute illicit funds -- as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars at any given time -- to far-flung ISIS affiliates on at least three continents through a network of clandestine contacts he built over more than a decade.In another sign of Mr. al-Sudani's importance, the military built a mock-up of his mountainous cave complex to allow commandos to rehearse their secret mission -- just as Navy SEAL Team 6 forces did before the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 in Pakistan.American officials did not reveal which Special Operations unit carried out Thursday's raid, but SEAL Team 6 has historically conducted the most sensitive counterterrorism missions in Somalia.Mr. Biden redeployed about 450 U.S. troops to Somalia last year, reversing former President Donald J. Trump's abrupt withdrawal in January 2021. But those forces only provide training to Somali forces and do not conduct counterterrorism operations, Pentagon officials said.Somalia is better known as a harbor for Al Shabab, the terrorist group linked to Al Qaeda, than for the Islamic State. Indeed, before Mr. al-Sudani joined the Islamic State, he was designated a terrorist by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2012 for helping foreign fighters travel to a Shabab training camp and for facilitating financing for foreign insurgents in Somalia.The raid represents the latest in a string of setbacks this year for the Islamic State and its core leadership in Iraq and Syria, the most serious since the end of the jihadists' so-called caliphate nearly four years ago.In late November, the Islamic State announced that its overall leader, whose identity has remained shrouded in mystery, had been killed in battle in Syria less than nine months after taking charge of the terrorist organization.Outside the Middle East, the group has experienced mixed success. Its branch in Afghanistan is locked in a stalemate with the Taliban government. But ISIS fighters have struck highly symbolic targets in Afghanistan, including Russian and Chinese interests.Islamic State fighters, along with Qaeda cells, are gaining strength in West Africa, with the violence now threatening countries like Ghana, Togo and Benin.At its peak, the Islamic State ruled a self-proclaimed caliphate the size of Britain that spanned the border between Syria and Iraq and boasted tens of thousands of fighters from around the globe. Its extremist vision of eternal combat between its forces and anyone who opposed them inspired deadly attacks in Paris, Brussels, Istanbul, Berlin, Baghdad and other major cities.But an international coalition led by the United States worked with local forces in Iraq and Syria to fight it, finally pushing it from its last patch of territory in eastern Syria in March 2019.Illustration This article appeared in print on page A7.",1.0
Death Toll of Russian Strike on City Far From the Front Lines Rises to 40:   [Foreign Desk ],Cities; Civilians; Apartment buildings; War; Military air strikes; Casualties,"The authorities said 34 people remained missing after three days of searching for the living and the dead at an apartment building struck by a Russian missile in Dnipro.Climbing over shards of concrete and metal, scraps of cloth and pulverized furniture, emergency workers found one body after another on Monday, lifting them out of the cratered wreckage that had once been bedrooms and kitchens in one of Ukraine's largest cities.The crews reported a new toll on Monday, days after the desperate search began: at least 40 people killed by a Russian strike over the weekend, one of the single deadliest for civilians since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly a year ago.Dnipro, the city where the ordinary, nine-story apartment building had stood, is far from the front lines where Ukrainian and Russian troops have been fighting viciously over abandoned villages and even mere yards of land. But the strike on Saturday fit a pattern of Russia firing long-range missiles at civilian targets, including residential neighborhoods and electrical plants -- what military analysts say is a Russian strategy, in the wake of battlefield setbacks, to terrify civilians and pressure the Ukrainian government into talks.""After this horror that I saw, I cannot imagine they wanted anything else,"" said Viktoria Tamich, 33, an event organizer whose apartment, across the street from the strike site, is now a chaotic jumble of debris and broken glass.At a coffee shop when the air raid siren sounded on Saturday, she narrowly avoided being home during the strike. When she did return, she said, she saw a ""terrible scene"" of smoking rubble and bloodstains in the stairways of her own building.""I could hear people screaming under the ruins,"" she said.The United Nations said on Monday that it had confirmed the deaths of more than 7,000 Ukrainian civilians since last February, including 398 children. But the numbers include only deaths it has been able to corroborate, and U.N. monitors acknowledged that the full civilian toll is much higher.Russia's recent strikes have hit cities far from the most intense fighting, which is currently in eastern Ukraine. Russian shelling on Monday hit a boarding school, a residential building and a vacant children's hospital in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, the regional governor said, part of a days-long bombardment of the area that heavily damaged a Red Cross facility and left at least three people dead.The attacks on civilian areas come as Ukraine and Russia are locked in battles around the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby town of Soledar. Ukrainian officials say that their forces are still hanging onto parts of Soledar, notwithstanding claims by Russia's military and a private military company, Wagner, that they have taken the town.Military analysts say that Ukraine, Russia and Wagner have all suffered heavy losses in eastern Ukraine, describing the fighting as a contest of attrition, with Russia relying on troops drafted in the fall, Wagner on men recruited from prisons, and Ukraine on the continued support from the West.Some Ukrainian officials have raised concerns about Russian military exercises that began on Monday in Belarus, which the Kremlin used as a staging ground to attack last year. Faced with the activity in Belarus, the deep toll of the missile strikes and a long war ahead, the government in Kyiv has urged its backers in the United States and Europe to redouble their military aid, securing promises of British tanks and French, German and American armored vehicles.The United States has also started training 500 Ukrainian soldiers, a U.S. military official said on Monday, on how to coordinate units in battle using artillery, armor and ground forces. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited the U.S. base in Grafenwoehr, Germany, on Monday to view the training, which began on Sunday.To help Ukraine defend against the long-range missile strikes that have been battering civilians, like those in Dnipro, the U.S. military is working with its forces on the operation of the Patriot, an advanced air defense system. The Ukrainian troops have arrived at Fort Sill, Okla., for the training, the U.S. military announced on Monday. Both Germany and the United States have pledged the system to Ukraine.The strike on Dnipro added dozens more casualties to the staggering civilian toll in Ukraine. In addition to the 40 dead, at least 75 people were wounded in the strike and 34 remained unaccounted for as of Monday afternoon, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said in a post on Telegram.As night fell, rescue crews continued searching for the missing people, living or dead.

They included two young mothers, Olha Usova and Iryna Solomatenko. One victim, Maria Lebid, was 15 years old, a Ukrainian official said.“She was school president and ballroom dancer,” the official, Emine Dzheppar, the first deputy foreign minister, wrote on Twitter. “Her beautiful life dance was cut short.”Residents’ apartments were shorn open, exposing scenes of ordinary life disrupted violently.

Dnipro Mourns As Dozens Die In Russia Strike:   [Foreign Desk ],Missiles; Displaced persons; Military air strikes; Evacuations & rescues; Cities; War; Casualties,"Rescue workers were still digging through the ruins of a residential building in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Sunday, a day after a Russian missile attack.More than 24 hours after a heavy-duty missile built to sink ships exploded in a dense Ukrainian cityscape of homes and shops, the lights of emergency workers played across the rubble on Sunday, in search of life.Death was easy to find.As smoke and dust rose into the Dnipro sky, a light dusting of snow began to accumulate on five victims who had been pulled from the rubble and laid out in body bags in a small grassy area next to the destroyed building. They were five of 30 confirmed killed in a Russian strike on a civilian neighborhood -- 79 were injured -- and at least 30 people remained unaccounted for.Even some of those pulled from the debris that was once their homes seemed to have only an uncertain grasp on life.""I have no words, I have no emotions, I feel nothing except a great emptiness inside,"" one 23-year-old woman, Anastasiia Shvets, wrote on social media.An image of Ms. Shvets from the scene of the attack struck a chord with Ukrainians across the country. It shows a young woman clutching a stuffed animal and a golden Christmas garland as she stands in the ruins and waits to be rescued.Ms. Shvets somehow emerged with only a small head wound and bruises on her legs.

Death Toll Rises After Russian Strike Destroys Apartment Block,Invasions; Nazi era; Missiles; Looting; Displaced persons; Apartments; Evacuations & rescues; Cities,"Enlarge this image.Rescuers on Sunday continued to comb the rubble of a nine-story apartment building that was cut in half by a Russian strike, as the death toll from the attack in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro a day earlier climbed to 30. It was one of the largest losses of civilian lives far from the front line since the beginning of the war.At least one woman was pulled safely from the debris. The 27-year-old was taken to a hospital where she was being treated for severe hypothermia, local officials said.The residential building was struck late Saturday afternoon as Russia launched dozens of missiles at cities across Ukraine in two waves of strikes that coincided with the Orthodox New Year and shattered the relative calm of recent days.By Sunday evening, 30 people had been confirmed dead, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service. At least 75 people were injured, and more than 30 people were still believed to be missing, local officials said.The strike on the apartment building is one of a series of devastating large-scale attacks on residential areas of Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February. Russian strikes on targets such as train stations, theaters, shopping malls and residential neighborhoods have led to significant loss of civilian life, while the shelling of cities and towns near the front line has also caused a mounting civilian death toll.Under international law, it is a war crime to deliberately or recklessly attack civilian populations and places where civilians would be likely to congregate.More than 550 people were involved in the rescue operation as it passed the 24-hour mark, local officials said.On Sunday morning, five victims who had been pulled from the rubble in Dnipro were laid out in body bags in a small grassy area next to the destroyed building. A light dusting of snow began to accumulate on them as the hours went by and recovery efforts continued.At least 400 people lived in the large apartment building and the immediate area around it, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, and 72 apartments were destroyed in the attack.

2 Claims for 1 Conquest Lay Bare a Russian Rift:   [Foreign Desk ],Invasions; Military engagements; Leadership; Failure; Defense,"After Russia's Defense Ministry said its troops had taken Soledar, a leader of the Wagner mercenary group accused the military of stealing credit. Ukraine said its forces were still fighting there.A Russian claim of victory on Friday in a town in eastern Ukraine exposed a growing rift in Moscow's war effort, as the Russian military and a private mercenary group contradicted each other publicly about who should get credit for the gains.Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement that its troops had taken control of the town, Soledar -- which would be Russia's largest battlefield success in months -- but made no mention of the Kremlin-affiliated Wagner private military company, which has ordered waves of troops into fighting in the region.Shortly after the Defense Ministry issued the statement on Friday, Andrei Troshev, a senior Wagner commander, accused the ministry of stealing ""other people's achievements."" Three days earlier, Wagner claimed that Soledar had fallen to its fighters, pointedly saying that the Russian army was not involved, only to have the Kremlin dispute the statement.After months of intense combat and heavy casualties, who actually controlled Soledar remained unclear on Friday. The Ukrainian military said its troops were still holding onto parts of the town, but that Russia had deployed significant forces in the area and that the situation was dynamic.Although taking control of the town would provide Russia with new positions for artillery facing the nearby city of Bakhmut, where fighting has raged for months, analysts say Soledar itself has little strategic value and is unlikely to significantly change the battle for eastern Ukraine.The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said on Thursday night that geo-located footage indicated that Moscow's forces ""likely control most if not all of Soledar,"" but said capture of the town was ""at best a Russian Pyrrhic tactical victory,"" gained at a steep cost.Most of Soledar has been reduced to shattered buildings, jagged rubble and shell craters, and most of its prewar population of about 10,000 has fled. But after months of Russian military setbacks -- a chaotic collapse in the northeast in September, a retreat from a major city in the south in November, and heavy losses in the east all the while -- Russian military leaders appeared to view the town as a symbolic prize worth competing for.The public quarrel between Wagner and the Russian military highlighted the deep rifts and disorganization that have plagued Russia's invasion of Ukraine since it began almost a year ago. Late Friday, the Russian military appeared to try to patch up the dispute by issuing a second statement, this one with a rare statement of public praise for the Wagner fighters.In the statement, the Defense Ministry said it needed to ""clarify"" that a ""heterogeneous"" group had worked together in Soledar. The direct assault of city blocks, the ministry said, ""was accomplished with the courageous and selfless actions of the Wagner PMC volunteer assault troops.""The founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has for months taken a greater prominence in Russia's war efforts, recruiting prisoners to join his troops, deploying his own fighter jets and tanks, and openly denigrating and taunting Russian generals. Analysts have said that Mr. Prigozhin, by seizing on Russian military failures in Ukraine and highlighting Wagner's role, has sought to raise his stature with President Vladimir V. Putin.In the battles for Soledar and Bakhmut, where Wagner troops have been engaged for months, Mr. Prigozhin has sought to portray himself as leading Russia's only successful offensive. He has shared videos that show him with soldiers in person, purporting to be near the front, and criticized military leaders for staying far from the fighting.On Friday, one of Mr. Prigozhin's companies quoted him on Telegram saying that Wagner faced a struggle against ""corruption, bureaucracy and officials who want to stay in their places,"" calling this a ""more serious threat"" to his company than the United States. He did not specify the officials he was referring to.In a statement on Friday night, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine reveled in the rift among the Russians and said his country's troops were still fighting in Soledar. ""They are already gnawing among themselves over who should be credited with some tactical advance,"" he said, adding that the dispute was ""a clear signal of failure for the enemy"" and an incentive for Ukraine to put more pressure on Russia.In a reflection of the shifting power dynamics within the Kremlin, the top commander of Russia's war effort -- a general praised by Mr. Prigozhin -- was abruptly replaced on Wednesday by Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, a longstanding member of Russia's military establishment.Mr. Gerasimov, the chief of the military general staff, was an architect of the invasion that has exposed to the world the dysfunction within Russia's vaunted military. Russian nationalists and war hawks have increasingly criticized his leadership of the armed forces in the wake of Russian defeats and struggles.The general he replaced, Sergei Surovikin, was widely regarded as a competent commander: In his three months overseeing the war effort, he ordered a retreat from Kherson, a major city in Ukraine's south, redeployed Russian troops to shore up defenses and concentrated efforts on eastern Ukraine. On Wednesday, he was named one of Mr. Gerasimov's deputies.The shake-up probably reflected systemic issues in the Russian military, Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, said on Thursday. He cited ""logistics problems, command and control problems, sustainment problems, morale and the large failure to achieve the strategic objectives that they've set for themselves.""Western officials say that Russia, Wagner and Ukraine have all suffered heavy losses in the region, especially as Russia and Wagner have sent waves of men into battle in an effort to overwhelm Ukraine's troops.Russian forces in the area far outnumber the Ukrainian troops who remain, according to people familiar with the matter on the Ukrainian side in the eastern Donbas region. They said the fighting was fierce and that resupply efforts were hindered by heavy Russian tank fire.Military analysts say that even if Soledar were to fall, it would not necessarily mean that Bakhmut -- or the whole of the Donbas -- was next.The White House's national security spokesman, John Kirby, when asked on Thursday about the status of Soledar, cautioned that it was important to ""keep this in perspective.""""We don't know how it's going to go, so I'm not going to predict failure or success here,"" he told reporters. ""But even if both Bakhmut and Soledar fall to the Russians, it's not going to make a -- it's not going to have a strategic impact on the war itself.""He added: ""If you look at what's been happening over the last 10 and a half months, particularly in the Donbas, towns and villages have swapped hands quite frequently.""Thomas Gibbons-Neff, Cassandra Vinograd and Carly Olson contributed reporting.Thomas Gibbons-Neff, Cassandra Vinograd and Carly Olson contributed reporting.Photograph A frame from a video released by the Russian Defense Ministry purportedly showed howitzers firing in eastern Ukraine.

"Russia is Sending More Troops to Eastern Ukraine, Kyiv Says",Invasions; Funerals; Alliances; Military personnel; Emergency services,"Enlarge this image.Russia is building up its forces in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian defense official said Thursday, as Moscow’s forces struggle on in their bid to capture a small salt-mining town in the east that has largely been reduced to rubble.The battle over Soledar has become emblematic of Moscow’s labored and costly offensive in eastern Ukraine.After days of intense street fighting, uncertainty over which side controlled the town of Soledar in Donetsk province remained Thursday, though there was no doubt about the devastation that had been wrought. Images released by the satellite company Maxar showed a score of apartment buildings and houses shattered beyond repair.Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, Hanna Maliar, said that “Russia is building up its forces in Ukraine but Ukrainian forces are holding out in fierce fighting for control of the eastern town of Soledar.”Citing the country’s intelligence service, she said Russia was moving troops trained in Belarus and Russia to the combat zone to focus on Donetsk and Luhansk provinces in the east of the country.Soledar and a number of other locations in the Bakhmut region “were subject to tank, mortar, barrel and rocket artillery attacks,” according to an update from Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces.The general staff bulletin claimed that about 100 Russian soldiers had been killed by Ukrainian special forces working with other front-line teams. It was not possible to confirm the figure independently.“The enemy is suffering great losses,” said Serhiy Cherevaty, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern forces.The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Thursday that “a huge amount of work has been done” in the battle for Soledar, but that “there is still a lot of work ahead.”While it is technically a city, Soledar had a prewar population of just 10,000 people. It lies about 6 miles from Bakhmut, a town with a prewar population of 70,000 that Russian forces have targeted since the summer, pouring in troops and attacking with artillery in the surrounding towns and villages.Russia sees Bakhmut as a gateway to the complete conquest of Donbas, the industrial region that includes Donetsk province. Moscow seized part of the region in 2014 and established breakaway republics.The Kremlin on Wednesday named Gen. Valery Gerasimov, who helped plan Russia’s stumbling invasion in February and who had served as Putin’s military chief of general staff for more than a decade, to replace Gen. Sergei Surovikin as the head of Russian forces in Ukraine.But that failed to reassure some Russian commentators, whose critical views of the conduct of the war have become increasingly influential.“The sum does not change, just by changing the places of its parts,” wrote one prominent blogger who goes by the name Rybar.If Russia were to take Soledar, it would be the first victory for Moscow’s forces after months of territorial gains by Ukraine in the northeast and south.“Ukraine starts the year in better shape than Russia. The Ukrainian Armed Force have momentum,” said Mick Ryan, a recently retired Australian army major general, noting the growing impact of air defense systems and weapons, which may soon include tanks, being supplied to Ukraine by its allies in Washington and Europe.

"Battle for Soledar Isn't Over, Ukraine Says",Invasions; Military vehicles; Mercenaries; Military air strikes; Military personnel; Emergency services,"Enlarge this image.KYIV, Ukraine — Fighting continued in the eastern Ukrainian town of Soledar on Wednesday, despite a claim by the founder of a mercenary force leading Russia’s offensive there that his troops had seized control of the town.President Volodymr Zelenksyy of Ukraine said at 7 p.m. local time that his forces were still holding Soledar and the nearby city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. He called the claim the town had been captured the work of “propagandists.”“But the fighting continues,” he said. “The Donetsk direction is holding out.

Ukraine Battles for Eastern Town as Russia Advances,Invasions; Military vehicles; Mercenaries; Military personnel,"Enlarge this image.KYIV, Ukraine — Intense fighting continued in the eastern Ukrainian town of Soledar on Wednesday, despite a claim by the founder of a mercenary force leading Russia’s offensive there that his troops had seized control of the town.A morning update from Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces gave no indication that the battle for Soledar, a small salt-mining municipality enmeshed in Russia’s quest to take a bigger city, Bakhmut, had ended. And Russia’s Defense Ministry and the Kremlin did not confirm the claim by the mercenary force, the Wagner private military company, that Soledar had fallen, saying that the town was only blocked for now.In the Russian Defense Ministry’s daily briefing, it said that its paratroopers “had blocked Soledar from the north and south” and that its assault units were “fighting in the city.” Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, urged reporters to wait for official announcements about whether the city had been captured, adding that “tactical successes are certainly very important as they come at a rather expensive price.”Peskov’s recommendation to wait for official announcements came days after the founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, asserted that it was his fighters who were leading the assault on Soledar and that he would be the one to announce its fall. On Tuesday, he circulated a photograph of himself purporting to be in a salt mine in Soledar and claimed that his forces had taken the city.On Wednesday, Prigozhin doubled down on his claim of full control over Soledar, saying that there was only some residual resistance in the mines.The competing claims over who has the authority to announce the fall of Soledar appeared to suggest growing strains between Russia’s military and Wagner. Prigozhin, an entrepreneur, is a longtime ally of President Vladimir Putin of Russia but has also been publicly critical of Russia’s Defense Ministry. He has become increasingly outspoken after acknowledging in September that he was the founder of the group.The group’s fighters have also been deployed in support of the Kremlin’s military campaigns in Africa and the Middle East. Wagner, which now includes recruited prisoners, has become the main force in the battle in the area of Bakhmut, and the fighting has been brutal.The claims played out in Russian media. Even as the Kremlin expressed caution, Russia’s Channel One — one of the two main state-run television networks — trumpeted in its news report Wednesday that Russian forces had achieved “a strategically important victory in the Donbas,” saying that “Soledar is under control.”The report said that Russian forces had pushed through a “labyrinth of underground strongholds” to capture Soledar. “The road is now open to other important towns,” the anchor said. No mention of Wagner was made.If Soledar did fall, the seizure of the relatively small municipality would be Russia’s first notable victory in months, after a string of humiliating losses. Ukraine changed the course of the war with its capture of the Kharkiv region in September and then the city of Kherson in November, successes of far greater magnitude.Moscow sees its campaign in the area around the city of Bakhmut as important to achieving its goal of occupying all of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. Military experts say that although taking Soledar would be significant, it would not signal that Bakhmut was about to fall into Russian hands. Ukraine has strongly reinforced its positions in the area, presenting a formidable obstacle to further progress by Moscow.The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research group, concluded in a Tuesday analysis that even if Russia captured Soledar, Ukraine could defend and resupply soldiers in Bakhmut.“The reality of block-by-block control of terrain in Soledar is obfuscated by the dynamic nature of urban combat,” the analysis said, though it noted that “Russian forces have largely struggled to make significant tactical gains in the Soledar area for months.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.",1.0
Russian Mercenaries Claim to Take Embattled Eastern Town,Artillery; Military personnel; Towns,"Enlarge this image.The founder of a Russian mercenary force leading Moscow’s assault on the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine claimed Tuesday that his troops had seized control of the town, according to the Russian state news agency TASS.The claim that Soledar had fallen to soldiers-for-hire working for Wagner Group could not be verified. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said on Twitter just before midnight local time that Russia was still trying to capture the town. The assault is part of Russia’s broader push in the area around the city of Bakhmut that Moscow sees as important to achieving its goal of occupying all of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.If true, the fall of Soledar, a relatively small municipality, would be Russia’s first significant victory in months, since Ukraine regained momentum with its capture of the Kharkiv region in September and then the city of Kherson in November, successes of far greater magnitude that changed the course of the war.The entrepreneur who started the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, maintained in a post on the Telegram messaging app that his troops had control, although he added that urban battles were still being fought in the town.In his nightly address Tuesday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine thanked the troops defending Soledar. “Today, I would like to pay special tribute to the warriors of the 46th separate airmobile brigade for their bravery and steadfastness in the defense of Soledar!” he said.How a tiny, salt-mining town with a prewar population of 10,000 people became a focus of such a sustained assault by Wagner’s forces has been an open question. In his overnight address Monday, Zelenskyy asked, “What did Russia want to gain there?”The most critical factor is perhaps not what Russian forces hope to gain in Soledar, but rather what Prigozhin and his mercenaries fighting there have to gain in terms of reputation. In Bakhmut, the Wagner Group, a private military contracting company that has recruited prisoners into its ranks, has become the main force leading the offensive for Russia, and the fighting has become bloodier.Before the emergence of the Wagner Group’s claims Tuesday, Britain’s Defense Ministry said in its daily intelligence update that Russian forces and the Wagner Group were likely now in control of most of Soledar after intense fighting over the past four days, The capture of the city, which is about 6 miles north of the city of Bakhmut, was likely to be part of “an effort to envelop Bakhmut from the north, and to disrupt Ukrainian lines of communication,” the update said.In his address Monday, Zelenskyy said that the fighting in Soledar was “extremely difficult” for Ukrainian forces, but that their resilience had “gained additional time and additional power for Ukraine.” “Everything is completely destroyed — there is almost no life left,” he said.The Ukrainian leader also said that thousands of fighters on Russia’s side had been killed there. “The whole land near Soledar is covered with the corpses of the occupiers and scars from the strikes,” he said. “This is what madness looks like.”A spokesperson for the eastern group of Ukraine’s army, Serhiy Cherevatyi, said on national television Tuesday that Russian artillery had struck Soledar 86 times over the past day. He said that the situation was “very challenging.”The tactics employed by the Wagner Group have resulted in a high number of casualties. In recent days, reporters for The New York Times embedded with a Ukrainian drone crew on the front line saw the bodies of Russian fighters scattered across open ground in the area around Bakhmut. Images and videos on Ukrainian social media in recent days also appear to have come from these aerial reconnaissance missions and show similar scenes.Prigozhin, a caterer and businessperson who is a close associate of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, is thought to want a victory in Bakhmut to boost his own political standing at home. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research group, noted in an analysis Monday that Prigozhin “continues to use reports of Wagner Group success in Soledar to bolster the Wagner Group’s reputation as an effective fighting force.”Prigozhin has emphasized that the group is the only Russian force fighting in Soledar, although Ukrainian officials and the Russian military say that Wagner is not the only group fighting for the city on Moscow’s behalf.Some Ukrainian messaging around the battle for Soledar on Tuesday appeared to suggest that losing control of the city to Russian forces would not be a major setback. Zelenskyy emphasized the importance of his forces’ broader goal of retaking the eastern Donbas region.“The result of this difficult and long battle will be the liberation of our entire Donbas,” he said in his overnight address.The larger battle is the fight for Bakhmut. For Russia, capturing it would be the most significant success in months.

Kyiv Commits To Tough Fight Over Bakhmut:   [Foreign Desk ],Invasions; War; Military engagements; Military strategy,"Earlier in the war, Ukraine's leadership was more equivocal about pitched battles with high casualties. There's no second-guessing this time. Some analysts say it makes sense strategically.BAKHMUT, Ukraine -- It was midmorning last Friday when the camera of a Ukrainian drone zoomed in on a Russian soldier moving furtively among trees on the edge of town. Another enemy assault was underway in the eastern city of Bakhmut.The drone pilot marked coordinates as he watched, then sent them by satellite link to artillery commanders.Within a few minutes, Ukrainian artillery units struck the houses where they had seen the Russians taking cover. Smoke from the hits could be seen rising silently on the drone operator's screen.Later that day, however, an armored vehicle rumbled out of an eastern neighborhood carrying wounded Ukrainian soldiers toward a stabilization point in the city's west. Ukraine's army was taking its hits, too.It's a grim stalemate that has taken on the rhythms of a heavyweight title bout, with each side going toe to toe in one of the longest-running battles of the war. That stands in contrast to Ukraine's strategy elsewhere along the front line, where it succeeded by avoiding direct confrontations, relying instead on nimble maneuvers, deception and Western-provided long-range weapons to force Russian retreats.In an earlier phase of the war, Ukraine's leadership had been more equivocal about pitched battles like Bakhmut. President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a rare moment of public self-doubt, mulled then whether the deaths of about 100 Ukrainian soldiers per day in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk were worth the fight for two already ruined cities.But this time, there has been no second-guessing. And new research suggests the lethal urban combat last summer was not as senseless as it might have seemed at the time.An analysis by two leading military analysts published last month by the Foreign Policy Research Institute vindicated the attritional fighting. The pitched battle weakened the Russian Army enough for two Ukrainian counterattacks in the fall to succeed, wrote the analysts, Rob Lee and Michael Kofman. Those offensives, in the Kharkiv region in the north and Kherson in the south, delivered two of the most embarrassing defeats of the war to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.""The amount of ammunition Russia expended and the casualties they took set up the Russian Army for failure,"" Mr. Lee said in an interview.Whether Bakhmut winds up playing a similar role ahead of expected spring offensives by Ukraine depends on many variables, he said, including how many soldiers Russia can field after a mobilization this past fall.Fierce fighting continued to rage on Monday along the front line that extends from Bakhmut northeast toward the city of Soledar, with the Russians claiming to have taken a nearby village and Ukraine saying that it had repelled Russian attempts to storm Soledar itself.Ukraine's deputy defense minister, Hanna Maliar, said in a post on Telegram that after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Soledar and subsequent retreat, the enemy regrouped ""and launched a powerful assault."" Ukrainian forces were ""bravely defending every inch,"" she wrote.At the Pentagon on Monday, a senior U.S. military official described the combat in and around Bakhmut as ""really severe and savage"" with both sides slugging it out.Bakhmut's strategic value is debatable, but it carries symbolic importance for both sides. For Russia, capturing it would be the most significant success in months. In Ukraine, the long battle and heavy losses have turned Bakhmut into a national symbol of defiance. Mr. Zelensky cited the city in a high-profile appearance before the U.S. Congress last month, and presented House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a Ukrainian flag signed by soldiers fighting in Bakhmut.(The imperative to ""Hold Bakhmut,"" as Ukrainians say, nevertheless carries some risks, analysts warn, saying that it could cloud military judgment and potentially delay a retreat if one becomes necessary).Viewed from the sky, on the monitor of a drone pilot, Bakhmut slides silently by in sepia hues of brown mud roads, gray rubble of homes and white smoke rising from fires. The stalemate has transformed a swath of ruins and mangled, muddy fields on the city's eastern rim into scenes reminiscent of World War I: Shell craters are ubiquitous, and the abandoned bodies of Russian soldiers lie about, with Ukrainian troops often complaining of the stink.""It's a place like Verdun in the First World War, where each side is trying to bleed out the other,"" Lt. Gen. Frederick B. Hodges, the former American commanding general in Europe, said of the battle of Bakhmut, now in its sixth month.A drone overflight of the wasteland on Thursday recorded a typical scene: two Russian bodies lying on the battlefield beside an artillery crater. ""It looks like apocalypse,"" Pvt. Oleksiy Kondakov, a Ukrainian soldier who rotated out of Bakhmut last month, said of the area.Inside the city, few civilians remain, most on the less heavily damaged western bank of the small river that divides Bakhmut, the Bakhmutovka. The eastern neighborhoods are panoramas of collapsed and burned houses.Soldiers settle into a familiar routine. Last Friday, a team of Ukrainians careened down a muddy street in a sport utility vehicle, wheeled into a courtyard and piled out, standing next to a wall with rifles ready, just as they do most days.Inside the relative safety of a ruined building, one soldier set about unspooling cable for a satellite link. Another unpacked a drone. They exchanged pleasantries with another unit that happened to be using the same devastated building that day, sharing tea with them and ignoring the booms and rattle of gunfire outside.In czarist times, the city was a trading hub in eastern Ukraine and a center of salt mining. The Soviet authorities renamed it Artyomovsk, after a Bolshevik who helped quash a short-lived Ukrainian independent republic in the early 1920s. Before Russia's invasion, it was home to red brick merchant houses and universities, nestled between rolling, grassy hills in the eastern Donbas region.Today, about 7,000 people remain of the city's prewar population of about 100,000, according to Tetiana Scherbak, a director of a volunteer soup kitchen on the western bank, where a few dozen civilians huddled around a wood stove on Friday, warming their hands and charging phones from a generator.In the central square, heedless of the explosions, on some days a drunken woman spirals and dances, arms out like a child mimicking the flight of an airplane. She is a character known to the locals who have remained.""Everybody suffers"" in her own way, said Svitlana Shpachenko, 54, a former accountant warming up at the soup kitchen.The battle in Bakhmut has been fought in two phases: for the first 100 days or so the Russian regular army was involved, and from then on a private military contracting company, the Wagner Group, which has recruited prisoners into its ranks.The second phase has been the bloodier one, as the Russians have assaulted the city using brigades made up of the convicts. The company's owner, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, who is a close associate of President Vladimir V. Putin and is seen as wanting a victory in Bakhmut to boost his political standing back in Russia, tested new tactics.Many of these units were essentially throwaway soldiers; Ukrainian soldiers have called them human wave assaults.""Essentially they take the brunt of whatever Ukrainian response there is,"" said the senior American military official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational details. ""Then you have better trained forces that move behind them to claim the ground that these individuals have walked over.""Serhiy Hrabsky, a former Ukrainian colonel and commentator for the Ukrainian news media, called the fighting around Bakhmut ""a completely different nature"" of war. Ukraine persists in the city's defense, he said, in part because ""their losses are important for us.""The attack on Friday was a case in point.The Russians were moving forward from the forest into the town on foot, with no armored vehicles to be seen by the drone flying overhead. On the screen, the readings of altitude and range ticked up and down.""Without eyes, we lose people,"" said the drone pilot, who asked to be identified by his nickname, Navara, in keeping with Ukrainian military policy. ""And we cannot lose people. We have fewer anyway.""Navara asked not to reveal precise locations but said it could generally be said of the Russians moving into town that ""the bastards are about 800 meters that way,"" pointing a finger out the broken window of the building.Not long afterward, Ukrainian artillery hit the Russians as they took cover in an area of deserted and mostly destroyed one- and two-story homes.

Those offensives, in the Kharkiv region in the north and Kherson in the south, delivered two of the most embarrassing defeats of the war to President Vladimir Putin of Russia.“The amount of ammunition Russia expended and the casualties they took set up the Russian army for failure,” Lee said in an interview.Whether Bakhmut winds up playing a similar role before expected spring offensives by Ukraine depends on many variables, he said, including how many soldiers Russia can field after a mobilization this past fall and the ratio of contractors to regular army soldiers Russia is losing around Bakhmut.Fierce fighting continued to rage on Monday along the front line that extends from Bakhmut northeast toward the city of Soledar, with the Russians claiming to have taken a nearby village and Ukraine saying that it had repelled Russian attempts to storm Soledar itself.Viewed from the sky, on the monitor of a drone pilot, Bakhmut slides silently by in sepia hues of brown mud roads, gray rubble of homes and white smoke rising from fires. The stalemate has transformed a swath of ruins and mangled, muddy fields on the city’s eastern rim into scenes reminiscent of World War I: Shell craters are ubiquitous, and the abandoned bodies of Russian soldiers lie about, with Ukrainian troops often complaining of the stink.“It’s a place like Verdun in the First World War, where each side is trying to bleed out the other,” Gen. Frederick Hodges, the former U.S. commanding general in Europe, said of the battle of Bakhmut, now in its sixth month.A drone overflight of the wasteland Thursday recorded a typical scene: two Russian bodies lying on the battlefield beside an artillery crater. “It looks like apocalypse,” Pvt. Oleksiy Kondakov, a Ukrainian soldier who rotated out of Bakhmut last month, said of the area.Inside the city, few civilians remain, most on the less heavily damaged western bank of the small river that divides Bakhmut, the Bakhmutovka. The eastern neighborhoods are panoramas of collapsed and burned houses.Soldiers settle into a familiar routine. Last Friday, a team of Ukrainians careened down a muddy street in an SUV, wheeled into a courtyard and piled out, standing next to a wall with rifles ready, just as they do most days.Inside the relative safety of a ruined building, one soldier set about unspooling cable for a satellite link. Another unpacked a drone. They exchanged pleasantries with another unit that happened to be using the same devastated building that day, sharing tea with them and ignoring the booms and rattle of gunfire outside.In czarist times, the city was a trading hub in eastern Ukraine and a center of salt mining. The Soviet authorities renamed it Artyomovsk, after a Bolshevik who helped quash a short-lived Ukrainian independent republic in the early 1920s. Before Russia’s invasion, it was home to red brick merchant houses and universities, nestled between rolling, grassy hills in the eastern Donbas region.Today, about 7,000 people remain of the city’s prewar population of about 100,000, according to Tetiana Scherbak, a director of a volunteer soup kitchen on the western bank, where a few dozen civilians huddled around a wood stove Friday, warming their hands and charging phones from a generator.In the central square, heedless of the explosions, on some days a drunken woman spirals and dances, arms out like a child mimicking the flight of an airplane. She is a character known to the locals who have remained.“Everybody suffers” in her own way, said Svitlana Shpachenko, 54, a former accountant warming up at the soup kitchen.In Ukraine, the long battle and heavy losses have turned Bakhmut into a national symbol of defiance. While this has provided a beleaguered citizenry a proud rallying cry, some analysts say it risks clouding military judgment, delaying a retreat if one becomes necessary. A Russian advance might also be stopped from the high ground to the west of the city, they point out.The battle in Bakhmut has been fought in two phases: for the first 100 days or so the Russian regular army was involved, and from then on a private military contracting company, the Wagner Group, which has recruited prisoners into its ranks.The second phase has been the bloodier one, as the Russians have assaulted the city using brigades made up of the convicts. The company’s owner, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, who is a close associate of President Vladimir Putin and is seen as wanting a victory in Bakhmut to boost his political standing back in Russia, tested new tactics.Many of these units were essentially throwaway soldiers put into what Lee, the military analyst, called “not-well-supported infantry offensives.” Ukrainian soldiers have called them human wave assaults.“It’s a completely different nature” of war than elsewhere in Ukraine, Serhiy Hrabsky, a former Ukrainian colonel and commentator for the Ukrainian news media, said of the fighting around Bakhmut. Ukraine persists in the city’s defense, he said, in part because “their losses are important for us.”The attack Friday was a case in point.The Russians were moving forward from the forest into the town on foot, with no armored vehicles to be seen by the drone flying overhead. On the screen, the readings of altitude and range ticked up and down.“Without eyes, we lose people,” said the drone pilot, who asked to be identified by his nickname, Navara, in keeping with Ukrainian military policy. “And we cannot lose people. We have fewer anyway.”Navara asked not to reveal precise locations but said it could generally be said of the Russians moving into town that “the bastards are about 800 meters that way,” pointing a finger out the broken window of the building.Not long afterward, Ukrainian artillery hit the Russians as they took cover in an area of deserted and mostly destroyed one- and two-story homes. In the streets of the neighborhood a firefight was picking up, and the clatter of machine guns echoed about.After a few flights, the drone team drove out by another road, avoiding the street fighting.Private Andriy Pancheko, a member of the drone team, had been working as an electrician in Poland before the invasion but returned and volunteered in the army. Broadly, he said, Ukrainians were defending their country because “if we don’t fight, we won’t have freedom.”The purpose of holding out specifically in the ruins of eastern Bakhmut was less clear, he admitted. “I don’t know, I just take orders,” he said. “They commanded me to be here. But why not? It’s our land.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.",1.0
Ukraine Moves ‘Step by Step’ as Pace Slows in Carrying Out Offensives in East,Invasions; Military withdrawals,"Enlarge this image.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine started with an eruption of firepower last winter, as its forces poured across the border and launched a multipronged assault. In late summer, Ukraine launched a lightning offensive of its own, routing Russian troops from the northeast.Now, 10 months into the war, the tempo of the fighting has been slower for both sides. Even as Russian forces claimed gains Monday around the eastern city of Bakhmut, which it has been trying for months to seize, there was little sign that dug-in Ukrainian forces would relinquish the city any time soon.“We are moving forward little by little, step by step,” Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, Hanna Maliar, said Sunday in a post on the Telegram social messaging app.While she was referring to fighting in the eastern area known as Donbas, her assessment could be applied to the conflict as a whole.As the one-year mark of the war approaches, less territory is changing hands. Autumn rains turned the ground into mud, a challenge for fighting vehicles. But both sides have signaled an intention to carry out new offensives, not least Ukraine, which seeks to recapture all of the territory Russia has seized since 2014.Military experts say that several factors explain the slower pace and seemingly smaller gains. Among them are the relative density of Russian forces in Donbas; the natural barrier posed by the Dnieper River in the south of the country, which has impeded Ukraine’s advance; the need by Ukraine to conserve and reconstitute its forces after a series of battles; and the winter weather, which has posed difficulties for both sides.“It felt going into the winter that the Russian military was the most vulnerable and the job of the Ukrainian military was to press the Russian military, to prevent force reconstitution, to maintain the initiative heading into the winter and the spring and then conduct an offensive at the time of their choosing,” said Michael Kofman, director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Virginia. “That’s not how things have played out.”He said that Russian forces had imposed on Ukraine a “difficult, grinding fight” around two cities in Donbas: Bakhmut, in the Donetsk region, and Kreminna in the Luhansk region.Russian forces have been trying to take Bakhmut since the summer, and fierce fighting was raging near the city Monday, amid competing claims about potential Russian advances in the area.The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, told Ukrainian television Sunday that weather was posing a challenge to both sides and that heavy equipment was getting stuck in soft ground.“In a day or two, it will freeze seriously, and it will be possible to drive normally without worrying about the fact that a tank or other equipment might get stuck,” he said. “I hope that the advantage will be on our side.”Russian forces are still inflicting great pain on Ukrainians, unleashing waves of missiles and exploding drones aimed at crippling the country’s energy infrastructure. While President Vladimir Putin ordered a brief cease-fire over the weekend to observe Orthodox Christmas, there was little change in the scale of fighting. Ukraine, too, has delivered significant blows, including a strike on a Russian military barracks in Donetsk over the New Year holiday that Moscow acknowledged killed at least 89 Russian soldiers, although Ukraine claimed the toll was in the hundreds.Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia might sharply escalate the war in a winter offensive. And the new armored vehicles that Western allies offered to Ukraine last week signaled they were gearing up for another bloody year of fighting, as Ukraine seeks to dislodge dug-in Russian forces.On Sunday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, acknowledged that “the situation on the front line has not changed significantly in the first week of the year.” In his nightly address, he stressed the need for “resilience.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.",1.0
Fighting for Ukraine to Take Revenge on Russia:   [Foreign Desk ],Invasions; Military policy; Oppression; Prisoners of war & missing in action; Minority & ethnic groups; Political leadership; War; Nazi groups; Volunteers; Military personnel; Military history; Armed forces,"KYIV REGION, Ukraine -- The sharp crack of sniper fire rang out across the snowbound valley. Soldiers in white camouflage crouched low, shooting at the hill opposite to provide cover as four men evacuated a casualty.The action was part of a live-fire training exercise for new recruits on a recent morning outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. But there was an unusual element to the event. While a Ukrainian Army officer was giving the orders, the trainees were members of a volunteer Chechen battalion that also mixed in some Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians.Ukraine's military commanders have long said they do not lack soldiers for the war, but they have nonetheless welcomed to their ranks thousands of volunteers, including foreign citizens. Many of them, like the Chechens, are refugees from Russia itself. Others have come from surrounding nations, like Georgia, that have a history of opposition to Moscow and the leadership of President Vladimir V. Putin.""We saw what was happening,"" said Muslim Madiyev, a gray-bearded deputy commander of the Chechen battalion, wearing ear protectors to muffle the sound of gunfire as he watched the training exercises. ""Ukraine has no shortage of men, but we have to join and be a part of this war.""Many of the volunteers were already living in Ukraine, either for work or seeking refuge from political oppression back home. Some volunteers have struggled with visas and residency permits, while their eagerness to join the fight has aroused suspicions among some Ukrainian officials and commanders, who are on high alert for saboteurs.But the volunteers seem to be finding their place. Mr. Madiyev, a veteran of two wars in Chechnya against Moscow, was an associate of Dzhokhar Dudayev, the former Soviet general who led Chechnya's bid for independence from Russia in the 1990s. Exiled from Chechnya, Mr. Madiyev settled in Ukraine in 2016.His battalion, named for the late Chechen leader, is one of several Chechen units that have joined Ukraine in its fight against Russia in recent years, following the 2014 uprising of Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea. Mr. Madiyev declined to reveal how many active fighters he had, saying simply, ""We have enough.""He spoke about the Russian invasion the way many Ukrainians do, saying that if Moscow is not stopped in Ukraine, it will threaten many more countries of Europe.But the younger fighters in his battalion take things further.""Our aim is the liberation of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria,"" a Chechen fighter said, using the name of the erstwhile self-declared republic, ""and to help all the nations who want it, to gain freedom."" In accordance with military protocol, he gave only his code name, Maga.The Chechens are only one example of numerous ethnic-based battalions and regiments that have been forming in Ukraine since Russia's invasion last February.Fighters from Belarus have formed a regiment thousands strong. Other volunteers come from the Caucasus and Central Asia, as well as from ethnic minorities that have large populations in Russia: Chechens, Tatars and Turkic-speaking groups.Most of them are motivated by historical grievances of dispossession and suppression by Moscow. Chechens and Tatars were among many groups that were decimated by forcible deportations under Stalin in the 1940s.There is also a smattering of Russian exiles, among them Russian nationalists and neo-Nazis who are opposed to Mr. Putin. A thousands-strong regiment of Belarusians includes many opponents of the country's president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko.Their participation in the war may be useful for Ukraine, but it is also a potentially explosive issue for the Kyiv government because most of them harbor long-term political ambitions to return home and overthrow the Russian and Belarusian governments. Ukrainian military officials declined to comment on their use of the volunteer groups, while a spokesman for the Ukrainian security service, the S.B.U., said it was not responsible for managing them.But the volunteers themselves say that they are acting with the full knowledge and under the orders of the Ukrainian Army and intelligence services. Many of their operations are covert, including dangerous reconnaissance or sabotage missions behind Russian lines.In response to an appeal by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, early in the war, thousands of volunteers poured in from Western countries, including the United States and Britain. Most joined the International Legion, which has been recognized by the Ukrainian government and, to some extent, integrated into the Ukrainian Army.At a news briefing last month, Ukraine's defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said there were ideological and political benefits to having foreign soldiers fighting alongside Ukrainians in defense of European values.Foreign soldiers were also gaining valuable experience, he added: ""The experience of the modern war here, the war of technologies, drone war and electronic warfare. So I think it's a win-win exchange.""But the volunteers from former Soviet republics are, in many ways, even more useful.They have a linguistic advantage because most speak Russian, which is widely spoken in Ukraine, and sometimes Ukrainian, making coordination with the Ukrainian military easier. And some, like a group of Georgians in the Kavkaz Legion, have battlefield experience, having served with the NATO-led force in Afghanistan.Their knowledge of Russia and Russians, and their hatred of Moscow, has made the volunteers good undercover operators for Kyiv. Some Ukrainian officials and lawmakers have even expressed support for their causes. In October, for example, the Ukrainian Parliament passed a motion recognizing the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria as a territory occupied by Russia.But they also face substantial risks, given the nature of their work behind enemy lines. Not just Russian citizens, but virtually any undercover soldiers captured by Russian forces would be dealt with harshly.One of the more recently formed volunteer battalions, Turan, is composed of Turkic-speaking ethnic groups from the Caucasus, Central Asia and Russia. It is led by a refugee from Kyrgyzstan, Almaz Kudabek, who had worked as a barber on American bases in his home country and in the Afghan city of Kandahar.He says he has recruited Azerbaijanis, Tatars and Chinese Uyghurs to the group, and he talks passionately about the marginalization and oppression of Turkic-speaking minorities in Russia. He said that Moscow had unfairly drawn conscripts for the war predominantly from remote and poorer regions of Russia, including those populated by Turkic-speaking ethnic minorities, who have been killed in far greater numbers than ethnic Russians.But Mr. Kudabek said members of his unit could turn that injustice to their advantage, infiltrating Russian-occupied territory on sabotage missions and even passing themselves off as Russian soldiers.""We just want to fight Russians,"" he said. ""We know what they are.""Despite their evident value to the Ukrainian military, the commanders of ethnic battalions complained of a lack of support from Kyiv. The Chechen battalion leader, Mr. Madiyev, said that beyond weapons and ammunition, the units have to provide for their own food, fuel and equipment.The leader of a Russian regiment, a far-right nationalist who uses the code name White Rex, said he ran into multiple obstacles when he formed the unit shortly after the Russians invaded.Although he and his fellow volunteers had lived in Ukraine for several years, they were initially met with suspicion from Ukrainians on edge about Russian saboteurs. ""We were held at gunpoint,"" he said. ""We had many funny, and not so funny, encounters, but I was determined to have this regiment.""But they have also found support among Ukrainians.A Ukrainian volunteer group, Bratstvo, eventually helped the Russian regiment find a role for itself not so dissimilar from the other ethnic battalions, operating behind Russian lines and carrying out reconnaissance and sabotage missions for the Ukrainian Army.Minutes before setting out on a night mission recently, White Rex said his aim had always been to find a way to return home to Russia. But he said the war had taught him that the way to return to Russia was to overthrow Mr. Putin and his government.""The Russian Volunteer Corps marches in and destroys the current government -- that's the only way,"" he said. ""You cannot persuade a tyrant to leave, and any other force would be seen as invaders.""Oleksandr Chubko contributed reporting.Oleksandr Chubko contributed reporting.Photograph Members of a Chechen battalion training with new recruits outside Kyiv, Ukraine, last month.

"Ukraine Keeps Downing Russian Drones, but Price Tag Is High",Invasions; Military policy; Military aircraft; Infrastructure; Energy industry; Assaults; Ammunition; War; New year; Drones; Missiles,"Enlarge this image.Exploding drones are lumbering and noisy and relatively easy to shoot from the sky and, over the New Year’s weekend, Ukraine says, its military downed every single one of about 80 that Russia sent the country’s way.“Such results have never been achieved before,” a Ukrainian air force spokesperson said Tuesday.But some military experts wonder if the successes are sustainable.Ukraine is getting more and more skilled at knocking down drones, but there is a growing imbalance: Many of its defensive weapons like surface-to-air missiles cost far more than the drones do. And that, some military experts say, may favor Moscow over the long haul.Artem Starosiek, the head of Molfar, a Ukrainian consultancy that supports the country’s war effort, estimated that it costs up to seven times more to down a drone with a missile than it does to launch one. That is an equation that the Kremlin may be banking on, some analysts say.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, in an overnight speech, warned that Russia was betting on the “exhaustion of our people, our air defense, our energy sector.”Ukraine has vowed not to be cowed by the aerial assault, but the attacks have been unrelenting.Molfar said its group estimated that, since September, Russia had launched around 600 drones at Ukraine. The campaign, targeted at infrastructure and accompanied by numerous missile strikes, has knocked out power, heating and water across Ukraine just as the country’s harsh winter has started to bite, compounding the misery of a Russian invasion that is nearing its first anniversary.The Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones that Moscow has increasingly been relying on since October are relatively uncomplicated devices and fairly cheap, while the array of weapons used to shoot them out of the sky can be much pricier, according to experts. The self-destructing drones can cost as little as $20,000 to produce, while the cost of firing a surface-to-air missile can range from $140,000 for a Soviet-era S-300 to $500,000 for a missile from an American NASAMS, or National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System.Since the war began in February, both sides have used drones not just for reconnaissance but also for attacks. It is the first time the devices have been so widely deployed in a European war. Some military experts view Ukraine as a testing ground for state-of-the-art weapons and information systems that may foreshadow the shape of warfare for generations to come.Military authorities in Kyiv have said little about the details of their air defenses — in keeping with the operational secrecy that has shrouded much of their war planning — or about the cost, making analysis difficult.But it is known that while Ukraine’s forces have enjoyed some success against drones using anti-aircraft guns and even small-arms fire, that has changed as the Russians have taken to launching assaults at night. Now Kyiv is also relying heavily on missiles fired from warplanes and the ground. Over the weekend, officials said, Ukraine employed surface-to-air missiles fired from NASAMS multiple times to counter drones.Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the CNA research institute, said that Ukrainians were using “a zoo of different air defense systems” to combat the threat, including Soviet-era and NATO missile systems, each with its own cost profile.Some of Ukraine’s anti-aircraft guns, like the Gepard 2 radar-directed mobile gun system, are inexpensive in comparison with other Soviet-era and European defense systems being deployed. But some of the American-made interceptor missiles are fairly expensive compared with drones.Even so, evaluating the wisdom of downing drones with missiles is not always straightforward.George Barros, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, said he suspected that Ukraine was deploying more complex and expensive air defense systems to protect sensitive and critical infrastructure.It costs far less, for example, to shoot down a drone than to repair a destroyed power station, Starosiek noted. And then there is the human factor.“People are still alive,” he said.Mathieu Boulegue, a consulting fellow with the Russia and Eurasia Program at Chatham House, a London-based research organization, said that Ukraine currently had enough air defense weapons and ammunition to combat the threat of Russian drones.“The cost is irrelevant as long as the West keeps providing military assistance to Ukraine,” Boulegue said. “The problem for Kyiv is the moment they don’t have enough stock of ammunition in their air defense chain to shoot down these drones.”Aware of the risk that Western allies may grow weary of the cost of supporting Ukraine’s defense — a concern heightened by the transfer of leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives to Republicans — Ukrainian officials have warned that Russian tactics are changing.The White House has said that it is aware of reports that the Kremlin and Iran are seeking to establish a joint production line for drones in Russia. Over the long term, Boulegue said, that would allow Moscow to deploy still more drones in attacks.“That is going to put more stress on Ukraine’s air defense system,” he said.That helps explain why Ukraine has adapted its own tactics, in part by conducting strikes on bases deep inside Russian territory. The goal, Boulegue said, is “to increase deterrence, which they hope will place less stress on air defense.”For now, Moscow has changed how it is using the drones it already has in hand.Russian forces have increasingly been launching their explosive drones at night and low along the Dnieper River, making it harder for Ukraine to detect them, according to Yurii Ihnat, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force, who was speaking on Ukrainian radio.“The radar antenna that detects the target will not see it if the target is flying below the level of the antenna,” he said.

Ukrainian Forces Grow More Adept at Defending Against Russian Drones,Infrastructure; Energy industry; Assaults; Humanitarianism; Drones; New year; Holidays & special occasions; Military air strikes; Military personnel,"Enlarge this image.Ukraine shot down all of the exploding drones that Russia had fired over the new year, a Ukrainian air force spokesperson said on Tuesday, in a measure of the country’s growing ability to resist Moscow’s effort to incapacitate its energy infrastructure.“Such results have never been achieved before,” the spokesperson, Yurii Ihnat, said on Ukrainian television, referring to the nights of Dec. 31 and Jan. 1.Russia launched its latest swarm of the Iranian-made weapons, nicknamed “flying mopeds” for their relatively slow speed, at targets inside Ukraine on Monday. None reached their destination because of anti-aircraft guns, surface-to-air missiles and warplanes, a rare shutout. Twenty drones were downed over Kyiv alone.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine said his military began the new year by putting up stiff resistance to the unmanned attacks from above.“Only two days have passed since the beginning of the year, and the number of Iranian drones shot down over Ukraine is already more than 80,” Zelenskyy said late Monday in his nightly address.In October, about a month after Russia began deploying the Shahed drones, an adviser to Ukraine’s defense minister said that they were shooting down more than 70% of the drones.As winter bites, the fighting on the ground in Ukraine has become a war of attrition, and the focus has shifted to the struggle in the air over Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and other major cities.Russia has launched wave after wave of drone and cruise missile attacks aimed at knocking out electricity and water supplies to civilians, leaving as much as 25% of the nation without power at times. Monday’s drone attack is the latest in a series of year-end assaults, including one that killed three civilians on New Year’s Eve.Given that Ukraine’s defensive measures cost more than Russia’s aerial attack methods, some military experts fear a growing imbalance that could, over time, favor Russia. In his nightly address Monday, Zelenskyy said his government had intelligence suggesting that there was no end in sight to the Russian attacks using Shaheds.“We have information that Russia is planning a prolonged attack with Shaheds,” he said, according to a transcript put out by his office. “Its bet may be on exhaustion — on exhaustion of our people, our air defense, our energy sector.”But, with each attack, Ukraine’s forces are getting better at taking out the drones before they hit their target, giving Ukraine what Zelenskyy called small “victories over terrorists and terror.”“Each shot-down drone, each shot-down missile, each day with electricity for our people and minimal schedules of blackouts are exactly such victories,” he said.One reason for the success against the drone campaign might be the United States’ decision in early November to provide Ukraine with an advanced surface-to-air missile system, known as NASAMS. It includes radar, sensors, launchers and a mobile command center.According to the Center for Strategic Communication and Information Security, a Ukrainian government agency, the U.S. missile system played a role in Monday’s assault.“Despite having learned to operate them only a few weeks ago, our military used them almost like artillery, reloading them as fast as possible,” the center said on Twitter. “The highly successful use of these weapons show that our soldiers learn fast.”Mick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and retired CIA officer, said training had helped Ukrainian forces get better and better at managing sophisticated weaponry.Russia, on the other hand, he said, seemed to be giving up on the idea of winning the war with a traditional land fight, at least in the near future.“It appears their fallback is just to blow the country to smithereens,” he said. “You can’t win a war by airstrikes.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.",1.0
Deadly Strike on Russians in Ukraine Exposes Moscow’s Military Failings,Invasions; Infrastructure; Ammunition; New year; Missiles; Military personnel; Armed forces; Cities,"Enlarge this image.In one of their deadliest attacks yet on Russian forces, Ukrainians used American-made rockets to kill dozens — and perhaps hundreds — of Moscow’s troops in a New Year’s Day strike behind the lines, prompting outraged Russian war hawks to accuse their military of lethal incompetence.The strike by the HIMARS rockets killed 63 Russian soldiers in a building housing them in the occupied city of Makiivka, in eastern Ukraine, the Russian Defense Ministry said Monday — an unusual admission for a military that has often refused to acknowledge serious losses. A former Russian paramilitary commander in Ukraine, Igor Girkin, wrote on the Telegram app that “many hundreds” were dead and wounded and that many “remained under the rubble.”Ukrainian military officials said it appeared that “about 400” Russian troops had been killed, though they did not explicitly say that Ukraine was behind the attack.None of the claims could be independently verified, but even the lowest number would represent one of the worst Russian losses in a single episode in the war, and an embarrassment for President Vladimir Putin of Russia. He has vowed repeatedly to correct the glaring errors and weaknesses in his armed forces that the war has exposed, and in a New Year’s Eve speech filmed at a military base, Putin told the families of soldiers killed in the fighting, “I share your pain with all my heart.”Pro-war Russian bloggers and some government officials said the debacle was caused by the military’s own repeated and costly mistakes, like garrisoning troops in a dense concentration within range of Ukrainian artillery, placing them in the same building as an ammunition depot, and allowing them to use cellphones, whose signals the Ukrainians can use to zero in on their target.“Our generals are untrainable in principle,” wrote Girkin, who has used the nom de guerre Igor Strelkov.Some pro-war lawmakers demanded an investigation, and one of them, Sergei Mironov, leader of a pro-Kremlin party in the parliament, called for the prosecution of all officials responsible, “whether they wear epaulets or not.”“Obviously neither intelligence nor counterintelligence or air defense worked properly,” he said.The attack was “a massive blow,” said a spokesperson for the Russian-installed proxy government in the Donetsk region, Daniil Bezsonov. “The enemy inflicted the most serious defeats in this war on us not because of their coolness and talent, but because of our mistakes,” he wrote in a Telegram post.More than 10 months after an invasion that Russians — and many Ukrainians — thought would produce a quick Russian victory, each side has suffered more than 100,000 killed and wounded, by Western estimates, and the war has become one of attrition, with no evidence of an end in sight.Some of the heaviest recent fighting has ravaged the Donetsk region, one of four the Kremlin claimed to annex in September even as its troops were losing ground there, giving up towns they had seized earlier in the war. Since then combat in the region has slowed to a bloody slog, as Ukrainians look for places to press their advantage, while Russians build trenches and fortifications along the front lines and try to capture the city of Bakhmut.On Monday, Russia launched a flurry of Iranian-made exploding drones at Ukraine, continuing its barrage against cities and civilian infrastructure, especially the power grid. But it appeared that Ukraine’s increasingly effective air defenses once again minimized the damage.The Ukrainian military said Monday that 22 drones were shot down over Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, in the early morning hours, but at least two loud explosions were heard in the city. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said some energy infrastructure facilities had been damaged, affecting systems that heat buildings. It was not clear if the explosions were caused by drones that evaded air defenses, by drones that were shot down but detonated on hitting the ground, or by air defense missiles.The Ukraine military said it had shot down all 45 Iranian Shahed drones launched over the weekend, although some cruise missiles penetrated its defenses.In his nightly video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine warned Monday, “We have information that Russia is planning a prolonged attack with Shaheds,” aiming to exhaust Ukraine’s defenses and its ability to endure. He said, “Now is the time when everyone involved in the protection of the sky should be especially attentive.”The deadly attack on Russian forces in Makiivka used the HIMARS rocket artillery to hit a vocational school where troops were housed, Moscow said. The Russian Defense Ministry said that four HIMARS rockets had hit the building, and that two others had been shot down by Russian air defenses.As pro-war bloggers and officials reacted with fury, video posted on social media showed firefighters amid the ruins of the structure, reduced to smoking piles of rubble. The bloggers have become influential opinion-makers in Russia amid the censorship of mainstream media.Girkin, the blogger and former paramilitary commander, wrote that the vocational school in Makiivka had been “almost completely destroyed” because “ammunition stored in the same building” detonated in the strike. The ammunition was stored “without the slightest sign of disguise,” he wrote, adding that similar strikes had occurred earlier this year, albeit with fewer casualties.Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at Rand Corp., noted that the Russian officials “do not typically provide this type of information after a major loss, which suggests they want to control the narrative on this event.”Makiivka, adjacent to the city of Donetsk, lies only about 10 miles from the nearest Ukrainian-held territory, the town of Avdiivka to the northwest — well within the roughly 50-mile range of the HIMARS rockets the United States has sent to Ukraine. A U.S. military official declined to comment on the strike.HIMARS, which fires satellite-guided rockets from mobile launchers, is part of a growing arsenal of sophisticated Western weapons that have helped Ukraine change the course of the conflict.Since the Biden administration began supplying the weapons system in June, HIMARS has greatly increased the range and precision of the outgunned Ukrainians. They have been used it to hit targets far behind the front lines, like the main bridge linking the city of Kherson to Russian-held territory, which contributed to the Russian decision to abandon the city.Last month, a Ukrainian HIMARS attack destroyed a hotel in the city of Kadiivka, in the Luhansk region northeast of Donetsk. That attack killed members of Kremlin-aligned Wagner paramilitary group who were using the hotel as a base, according to Ukrainian authorities in the region.The HIMARS system is most effective when used against stationary targets that can be identified in advance and pinpointed, such as ammunition dumps, infrastructure or troop concentrations. The U.S. has so far supplied Ukraine with at least 20 HIMARS systems, which are made by Lockheed Martin.Many soldiers who were casualties appeared to be new recruits, recently mobilized in Putin’s drive to conscript more men into the fighting in Ukraine. One report in Russian state media said that “active use of cellular phones by the newly arrived servicemen” had been a prime reason for the attack, helping Ukrainian forces to pinpoint their location.Throughout the war, Russian soldiers in Ukraine have spoken on open cellphone lines, often revealing their positions and exposing the disarray in their ranks. Although the continued use of the phones, despite the devastating consequences, exposes a failing by the military command, military bloggers say this explanation shifts the blame onto the victims.It does not address why Russian commanders housed so many conscripts in an unprotected building within reach of U.S.-made rockets.“No one is assuming the responsibility for the needless deaths,” one blogger, Anastasia Kashevarova, wrote on Telegram.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.",1.0
Russian Proxy Official Calls Attack in Donetsk a ‘Massive Blow’,Housing; Artillery; New year; Missiles; Ammunition; Humanitarianism; Military personnel,"Enlarge this image.Ukrainian forces used U.S.-supplied guided rockets to hit a building housing Russian soldiers in an occupied eastern city early on New Year’s Day, both sides said, in one of the deadliest strikes on Moscow’s forces in the 10-month-old war.The deaths of at least 60 soldiers, and possibly many more, drew immediate and harsh criticism in Russia from supporters of the war, who said that the military was making repeated and costly mistakes, including housing soldiers in dense numbers within striking distance of Ukrainian weapons.The Russian Defense Ministry said Monday that 63 service members had been killed in the strike in the city, Makiivka, which is in the Donetsk region. Ukraine claimed that “about 400” Russian soldiers had died. Neither figure could be independently verified.A spokesperson for the Russian-installed proxy government in the Donetsk region, Daniil Bezsonov, called the strike “a massive blow” and hinted at errors by Russian commanders. “The enemy inflicted the most serious defeats in this war on us not because of their coolness and talent, but because of our mistakes,” he wrote in a post on the Telegram messaging app.Ukraine hit the building housing the soldiers, which both sides described as a vocational school, using HIMARS, a guided rocket system supplied by the United States. The system’s range of dozens of miles has for months helped Ukraine’s forces strike deep behind the front lines.Kyiv has shifted in recent weeks from using the American-made rocket systems to hit ammunition dumps and supply lines to targeting barracks and other troop concentrations, said Michael Kofman, director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Virginia.The Russian Defense Ministry said that four HIMARS rockets had hit the building, while two others had been shot down by Russian air defenses.Anger over the Russian military’s failure to safeguard the soldiers extended beyond pro-war military bloggers. Even some Russian lawmakers who are usually in lockstep with the Kremlin demanded an investigation.One pro-war lawmaker, Sergei Mironov, a prominent member of the upper house of Russia’s parliament, called on his Telegram channel for criminal prosecution of all officials responsible for the Makiivka disaster “whether they wear epaulets or not.”“Obviously neither intelligence nor counterintelligence or air defense worked properly,” he said.Accounts by pro-war military bloggers — who have become influential opinion-makers in Russia amid the censorship of mainstream media — suggested that the strike in Makiivka had proved so deadly partly because of a litany of errors by Moscow’s forces, some of which have been repeated throughout the war.One military blogger, Igor Girkin, a former Russian paramilitary commander in Ukraine who is also known as Igor Strelkov, said that the vocational school had been “almost completely destroyed” because “ammunition stored in the same building” detonated in the strike. Video posted on social media showed firefighters amid the ruins of the structure and piles of steaming rubble.The ammunition was stored “without the slightest sign of disguise,” Girkin wrote, adding that similar strikes had occurred earlier this year, though with fewer casualties. “Our generals are untrainable in principle,” he said.Many of the soldiers appeared to be new recruits. A report in Russian state media said that “active use of cellular phones by the newly arrived servicemen” had been a prime reason for the attack, helping Ukrainian forces to pinpoint their location.Throughout the war, Russian soldiers in Ukraine have spoken on open cellphone lines, often revealing their positions and exposing the disarray in their ranks.Still, some military bloggers said that this official explanation shifted the blame for Makiivka onto the victims, without explaining why commanders housed so many conscripts in an unprotected building within reach of U.S.-made rockets.“No one is assuming the responsibility for the needless deaths,” one blogger, Anastasia Kashevarova, wrote on her Telegram channel.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has called such strikes ""revenge of the losers.""Viktoria Dubrovina, a retired subway system worker, heard what she described as booms in the sky and then explosions near an auditorium, called Palace of Ukraine, across the street from her apartment building in central Kyiv.""I just don't have words,"" she said. ""It's outrageous. We know how vile they are and everybody knew they were ready to attack on the holiday, in theory. But we hoped something would change. But they did it.""The blast shattered windows, tore a five-story-tall hole in the wall of a hotel and left concrete slabs and broken glass sprawled on a street. Strips of insulation blew about.The Palace of Ukraine, one of the largest concert halls in the country, typically stages children's plays during the day on New Year's Eve, but it was closed this year because of the electricity outages from earlier strikes, Andriy Vydysh, the site's deputy director, said in an interview. The foyer and makeup rooms were damaged.Ihor Suruchanu, a lawyer, came to look at a nearby building at the behest of clients. The structure was standing, he said, but the blast wave had passed through it, shattering windows and tearing even interior doors from their frames.That a civilian neighborhood had been hit, he said, did not dismay him -- it showed Russia in a state of desperation.""When I look at this, I think we will win,"" he said. He said he knew of no military targets or of even electrical infrastructure in the area; a nearby factory that had once made military electronics had closed years earlier.""Of course, they did this specifically on New Year's Eve,"" Mr. Suruchanu said.

Deadly Year in Ukraine Ends With a Big Assault:   [Foreign Desk ],Explosions; Bombings; War; Speeches; New year; Missiles; Military air strikes; Military personnel; Cities,"Explosions hit the capital, Kyiv, and other cities on the final day of a year shaped by Russia's invasion. Flanked by soldiers, Vladimir V. Putin called the invasion a ""sacred duty"" of Russians.KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia rained missiles and exploding drones on Ukraine's capital and other cities on Saturday in a deadly New Year's Eve assault, punctuating President Vladimir V. Putin's stated resolve to prosecute a war he called a ""sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants.""The aerial bombardments killed at least one person and partly destroyed a hotel in the capital, Kyiv, inflicted damage elsewhere and forced Ukraine's war-ravaged electric utilities to pre-emptively shut off power.""There are explosions in Kyiv!"" Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""Stay in shelters!""Describing the New Year's Eve assault as ""inhuman"" and Russia as a ""terrorist state,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine directed his rage at Mr. Putin and his subordinates, declaring in a videotaped reaction that ""those who give orders for such strikes, and those who carry them out, will not receive a pardon. To put it mildly.""Even for residents inured to brazen Russian bombings, the wail of air-raid sirens and the explosive thuds on New Year's Eve and into the first hours of 2023 were especially galling. If Mr. Putin's intent was to demoralize them, the aerial assault only generated more hate. ""We know how vile they are and everybody knew they were ready to attack on the holiday, in theory,"" said Viktoria Dubrovina, a retired Kyiv subway worker who joined others inspecting the damage after sirens stopped. ""But we hoped something would change. But they did it.""In his New Year's address, Mr. Zelensky said that Ukrainians woke up on Feb. 24, the first day of the invasion, ""into another life."" He said that the first Russian missile barrage ""finally destroyed the labyrinth of illusions. We saw who was who. What friends and enemy are capable of, and most importantly, what we are capable of.""He added of the coming year, ""let this year be the year of return"" of soldiers to families, prisoners to homes, and Ukrainian land to Ukraine. ""The temporarily occupied will become forever free,"" he said.The attacks began in midafternoon, only hours before Mr. Zelensky had been scheduled to deliver a much-anticipated speech to a nation where the Russian invasion has shaped the past 10 months and could for many more or far longer.Air defense crews shot down 12 of at least 20 cruise missiles launched by Russia on Saturday afternoon, the top Ukrainian military commander, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said on Telegram. The missiles had been launched from Russian strategic bombers over the Caspian Sea and from land-based launchers, he said.Air raid sirens rang out again after midnight, and several loud explosions were heard in central Kyiv in the ensuing hours, ringing out in an otherwise dark and still city with residents confined in their apartments by the curfew. Ukrainian officials said air defense systems had successfully hit several targets. No injuries were immediately reported.In his own traditional New Year's Eve address, Mr. Putin broke from practice and delivered the speech not at the Kremlin, but flanked by soldiers at an unspecified military base. He struck a defiant tone, repeating claims that his invasion of Ukraine was a defensive struggle for Russia's existence.Mr. Zelensky, whose impassioned nightly speeches have been become a rallying cry for Ukrainian patriotism and defiance of Russa, had warned on Thursday that the Russian military might launch another wave of missile attacks before any year-end commemorations. Moscow fired a large volley this past week, disrupting electrical power in Kyiv and in other cities.What electricity had been available before the strikes was lost on Saturday in Kyiv, in Odesa in the south, and in cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region in central Ukraine, as the authorities switched off power to prevent short-circuits on the grid caused by any strike damage.Within a few minutes of the explosions in Kyiv, reports of damage in several neighborhoods of the capital came out, and a video posted on Telegram showed smoke rising above the city.Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an aide to Mr. Zelensky, said in a post on social media that the city of Khmelnytskyi, in western Ukraine, had been attacked by exploding drones and that two people were wounded. In the Zaporizhzhia region, he said, residential buildings were damaged.Between the larger waves of strikes on Thursday and Saturday, the Russian military had kept up the pressure on Ukraine's energy grid with smaller-scale missile attacks, according to Ukraine's military general staff.Over the past day, Russia fired five missiles and 10 exploding drones, and it carried out 29 airstrikes on civilian infrastructure, the general staff said in a statement on Saturday morning.How long Russia can sustain the barrage has been a pressing question in Ukraine, which has stymied and beat back the Russian military across several fronts since Mr. Putin launched the invasion in February.Ukraine has received increasingly sophisticated defense weaponry from the United States and other NATO nations, striking many of the incoming Russian missiles and drones before they reach their targets.Mr. Putin, who has repeatedly said Ukraine is not a legitimate country, used his year-end speech on Saturday as a platform to assert that ""moral and historical righteousness is on our side.""He defined the war in Ukraine as Russians' ""sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants."" Russian soldiers, he said, were fighting to secure ""peace and security guarantees for Russia,"" while the West was using Ukraine ""to weaken and split up Russia.""And reprising his references to antiwar Russians as traitors, Mr. Putin described the year as one that ""clearly separated courage and heroism from betrayal and cowardice.""Mr. Putin was working to rally Russian citizens who are increasingly feeling the effects of a conflict that has left their country the most economically isolated since the breakup of the Soviet Union three decades ago.Moreover, Russian troops have suffered a series of embarrassing setbacks on the battlefield, and the military's strategy has been increasingly criticized, even by domestic supporters of Russia's invasion.While the Kremlin had initially envisioned a quick conquest of Ukraine in February, sending troops speeding into cities with only a few days' supplies, the invasion has mired Russia in a grueling war and revealed weaknesses in its conventional military abilities. American officials say that more than 100,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured since the invasion in February.""We will do all we can to help the families of our killed comrades,"" Mr. Putin said in his remarks on Saturday. ""I share your pain with all my heart.""In addition to trying to raise spirits on the home front, Mr. Putin's speech also demonstrated his latest attempt to signal to the West that he has no plans to ease his onslaught against Ukraine.His singular focus on the war in his New Year's speech showed that the Kremlin had fully dispensed with its earlier strategy of playing down the war for the broader public, even though officials still refer to the fighting as only a ""special military operation.""New Year's Eve was also a reminder of one of Mr. Putin's biggest miscalculations: Western unity in the face of the invasion.Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, in his own traditional New Year's Eve speech, said that despite ""a difficult year,"" Germany and the rest of Europe had withstood unexpected hardships caused by Mr. Putin's war.Mr. Scholz's first 12 months as chancellor have been among the most tumultuous of Germany's postwar history. It was not what he, nor nearly anyone in Europe, had expected.""Putin is conducting an imperialist war of aggression at the heart of Europe,"" he said in a speech broadcast on Saturday evening. ""This watershed moment is also a tough test for us and our country.""But on the eve of a new year, Mr. Scholz argued that 2022 also reflected strengths to celebrate.""The history of 2022 is not purely one of war, suffering and worry,"" he said. ""After all, Putin did not manage, as he had planned, to overrun Ukraine in a matter of days.""""On the contrary, the Ukrainians are bravely defending their homeland -- thanks in part to our help,"" he said. ""And we will continue to support Ukraine.""Erika Solomon, Rick Gladstone and Matt Surman contributed reporting.Erika Solomon, Rick Gladstone and Matt Surman contributed reporting.The Russian attack on Saturday partly destroyed a hotel in Kyiv, above.

Russian artillery shells kept streaking overhead and thudding into Ukrainian-held territory through the afternoon and evening, just as they had for months, despite a supposed 36-hour cease-fire declared by Russia.There were scattered reports of attacks elsewhere in Ukraine, but the clearest contradiction of the promised lull in the fighting was in Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk Province, the scene of the most intense recent fighting of the war.

They dismissed it as a cynical propaganda ploy by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, as well as a bid to give battered Russian forces a breather. In any case, the Ukrainians said, they did not trust the Russians to stop shooting.Fighting continued on Friday along several parts of the front, which stretches hundreds of miles through southern and eastern Ukraine. Each side accused the other of initiating it, saying that their forces were just defending themselves. It was not immediately possible to verify their claims, or to determine how the intensity of combat compared to previous days.But a cease-fire this was not.Ukrainian officials and military analysts warned that the Kremlin would use any respite to replenish battered units, ferrying fresh troops, weapons and ammunition to the front. In his nightly video address, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Thursday that the government in Moscow ""wants to use Christmas as a cover"" to regroup and thwart Ukrainian advances.""Everyone in the world knows how the Kremlin uses lulls in the war to continue the war with new force,"" he added, and he addressed the Russian people directly, in Russian, speaking of those who ""sent all of your people to be slaughtered"" and ""do not strive for peace.""Since invading Ukraine in February, Russia has endured international condemnation and isolation, and seen its war effort stumble badly. Political analysts said that the Kremlin would try to use the Christmas cease-fire announcement -- which it cast as nothing more than a bid to allow soldiers and others on both sides to celebrate the holiday and attend church services -- for a badly needed public relations boost, both at home and abroad.Sure enough, the Kremlin and its allies on Friday portrayed Russia as the reasonable peacemaker and Ukraine as the aggressor, using the cease-fire announcement to bolster Mr. Putin's claim to be the defender of Orthodox Christianity against a decadent and godless West, though most Ukrainians are also Orthodox Christians.The Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leader publicly called for the cease-fire hours before it was announced, have developed an increasingly close alliance.""Ukrainians were offered a hand of Christian mercy on the great holiday,"" Dmitri A.

Kyiv Claims Steep Russian Toll in Strikes:   [Foreign Desk ],Artillery; New year; Military personnel; Social networks; War,"Kyiv says its forces have killed or wounded more than 1,000 Russian soldiers in a series of pinpoint attacks. Russia has confirmed only one of three waves of strikes.KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine has claimed a string of successful artillery attacks on Russian barracks in the first days of the year, asserting that it hit newly drafted men and other soldiers where they were sleeping or congregating, killing or wounding more than 1,000.The Russian military has confirmed one of the three waves of claimed strikes, though it gave a much lower death toll than the Ukrainians estimate. Even the lower toll of 89 soldiers killed in that attack, however, represents a startling setback for the Russian military.Social media posts, reports from local residents and Russians who blog about military affairs offered partial confirmation of the other strikes claimed by Ukraine, but not corroboration of the casualty counts.Military analysts say the Ukrainians' use of long-range artillery, including American-provided HIMARS precision rockets, to target barracks marks a shift for the artillery forces, which for months had concentrated on matériel like ammunition depots.The Ukrainian military's focus on the Russian infantry is among the first changes seen in its tactics with its American-provided weaponry, in response to Russia's mobilization of hundreds of thousands of soldiers over the fall. The haphazard movement of additional soldiers into the war zone, many of them poorly trained and led, has presented new targets behind the front lines for howitzers that can fire more than 20 miles and HIMARS rockets with a range of up to about 50 miles, analysts say.The Russian authorities say that draftees' use of personal cellphones on New Year's Eve helped the Ukrainians pinpoint a vocational school, being used to house soldiers, that was hit in the city of Makiivka in eastern Ukraine.Ukraine said the attack killed or wounded several hundred soldiers, while the Russians reported 89 dead. The casualty estimates could not be independently confirmed, and militaries often exaggerate the losses of their enemies and downplay their own.

"Ukraine Keeps Shooting Down Russian Drones, but at a Steep Price:   [Foreign Desk ]",Invasions; War; Military policy; Military aircraft; Missiles; Defense; Assaults,"When costly missiles take out cheap drones, the real winner over time may be the country that spends less.Exploding drones are lumbering and noisy and relatively easy to shoot from the sky and, over the New Year's weekend, Ukraine says, its military downed every single one of about 80 that Russia sent the country's way.""Such results have never been achieved before,"" a Ukrainian air force spokesman said on Tuesday.But some military experts wonder if the successes are sustainable.Ukraine is getting more and more skilled at knocking down drones, but there is a growing imbalance: Many of its defensive weapons like surface-to-air missiles cost far more than the drones do. And that, some military experts say, may favor Moscow over the long haul.Artem Starosiek, the head of Molfar, a Ukrainian consultancy that supports the country's war effort, estimated that it costs up to seven times more to down a drone with a missile than it does to launch one. That is an equation that the Kremlin may be banking on, some analysts say.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in an overnight speech, warned that Russia was betting on the ""exhaustion of our people, our air defense, our energy sector.""Ukraine has vowed not to be cowed by the aerial assault, but the attacks have been unrelenting.Molfar said its group estimated that, since September, Russia had launched around 600 drones at Ukraine. The campaign, targeted at infrastructure and accompanied by numerous missile strikes, has knocked out power, heating and water across Ukraine just as the country's harsh winter has started to bite, compounding the misery of a Russian invasion that is nearing its first anniversary.The Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones that Moscow has increasingly been relying on since October are relatively uncomplicated devices and fairly cheap, while the array of weapons used to shoot them out of the sky can be much pricier, according to experts. The self-destructing drones can cost as little as $ 20,000 to produce, while the cost of firing a surface-to-air missile can range from $ 140,000 for a Soviet-era S-300 to $ 500,000 for a missile from an American NASAMS.Since the war began in February, both sides have used drones not just for reconnaissance but also for attacks. It is the first time the devices have been so widely deployed in a European war. Some military experts view Ukraine as a testing ground for state-of-the-art weapons and information systems that may foreshadow the shape of warfare for generations to come.The military authorities in Kyiv have said little about the details of their air defenses -- in keeping with the operational secrecy that has shrouded much of their war planning -- or about the cost, making analysis difficult.But it is known that while Ukraine's forces have enjoyed some success against drones using antiaircraft guns and even small-arms fire, that has changed as the Russians have taken to launching assaults at night. Now Kyiv is also relying heavily on missiles fired from warplanes and the ground. Over the weekend, officials said, Ukraine employed surface-to-air missiles fired from NASAMS -- for National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System -- multiple times to counter drones.Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the CNA research institute, said that Ukrainians were using ""a zoo of different air defense systems"" to combat the threat, including Soviet-era and NATO missile systems, each with its own cost profile.Some of Ukraine's antiaircraft guns, like the Gepard 2 radar-directed mobile gun system, are inexpensive in comparison with other Soviet-era and European defense systems being deployed. But some of the American-made interceptor missiles are fairly expensive compared with drones.Even so, evaluating the wisdom of downing drones with missiles is not always straightforward.George Barros, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, said he suspected that Ukraine was deploying more complex and expensive air defense systems to protect sensitive and critical infrastructure.It costs far less, for example, to shoot down a drone than to repair a destroyed power station, Mr. Starosiek noted. And then there is the human factor.""People are still alive,"" he said.Mathieu Boulegue, a consulting fellow with the Russia and Eurasia Program at Chatham House, a London-based research organization, said that Ukraine currently had enough air defense weapons and ammunition to combat the threat of Russian drones.""The cost is irrelevant as long as the West keeps providing military assistance to Ukraine,"" Mr. Boulegue said. ""The problem for Kyiv is the moment they don't have enough stock of ammunition in their air-defense chain to shoot down these drones.""Aware of the risk that Western allies may grow weary of the cost of supporting Ukraine's defense -- a concern heightened by the transfer of leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives to the Republicans -- Ukrainian officials have warned that Russian tactics are changing.The White House has said that it is aware of reports that the Kremlin and Tehran are seeking to establish a joint production line for drones in Russia. Over the long term, Mr. Boulegue said, that would allow Moscow to deploy still more drones in attacks.""That is going to put more stress on Ukraine's air defense system,"" he said.That helps explain why Ukraine has adapted its own tactics, in part by conducting strikes on bases deep inside Russian territory. The goal, Mr. Boulegue said, is ""to increase deterrence, which they hope will place less stress on air defense.""For now, Moscow has changed how it is using the drones it already has in hand.Russian forces have increasingly been launching their explosive drones at night and low along the Dnipro River, making it harder for Ukraine to detect them, according to Yurii Ihnat, the spokesman for the Ukrainian air force, who was speaking on Ukrainian radio.""The radar antenna that detects the target will not see it if the target is flying below the level of the antenna,"" he said.Andrew E.

"U.S. Troops Train Near Crimea, Sending a Warning to Russia:   [Foreign Desk ]",Invasions; Military policy; Military exercises; War; Military personnel; Armed forces; Military aid; Military training; Military deployment,"The deployment to a NATO country near the conflict in Ukraine is seen as a model of deterrence for a U.S. military that has recently stepped back from direct fighting.MIHAIL KOGALNICEANU AIR BASE, Romania -- The soldiers of the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division train, eat and sleep on a drab, sprawling post in southeast Romania, a mere seven-minute rocket flight from where Russia has stockpiled munitions in Crimea.Farther north, in military exercises with Romanian troops just a few miles from the Ukrainian border, U.S. soldiers, also from the 101st division, are firing artillery, launching helicopter assaults and digging trenches similar to those on the front lines in the region near Kherson, the Ukrainian port city from which Russian troops retreated in November.It is the first time the 101st Airborne Division has been deployed to Europe since World War II, and with their presence in Romania, a member of NATO, its soldiers are now closer to the war in Ukraine than any other U.S. Army unit.Its mission is considered a model for an American miliary that has newly stepped back from two decades of actively fighting wars and into an era of trying to deter adversaries -- using a show of force as well as training, weapons shipments and other aid to drive home the point.""This is a regional conflict, but it has global implications,"" the U.S. Army's chief of staff, Gen. James C. McConville, said in a mid-December interview at the air base, which shares a runway with an adjoining commercial airport named for the former Romanian prime minister, Mihail Kogalniceanu, near the Black Sea.The troop deployment in Romania is meant as a warning to Moscow, part of President Biden's pledge to defend ""every single inch"" of NATO territory without tempting President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into escalating. But holding joint exercises is also a way of ensuring that allies in southeast Europe are ready to hold the line.It is unclear what kind of footprint the United States will keep at the base; the Pentagon will soon decide whether to maintain the number of American troops and senior commanders there.Some in Congress are wary of the cost of meeting Ukraine's continuing demands for support -- with the top House Republican, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, suggesting in October that his party might be unwilling to write a ""blank check"" to Ukraine.But supporters of maintaining a strong presence in Eastern Europe pointed to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February as proof that the United States and its NATO allies did not do enough to deter Moscow last winter.""This is one of the most important lessons that we have to take away from Ukraine,"" Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, told reporters after returning from a brief trip to Ukraine in early December. ""When we look at the other scenario that might unfold like Ukraine, in the Pacific with China and Taiwan, we have to ensure that deterrence is successful.""Military planners echoed that strategy, noting that the 101st Airborne Division was also using the Black Sea for coastal defense training -- a useful skill should China ever become more aggressive and invade Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing has long claimed as its own.The division was ordered to deploy about 4,000 soldiers and senior commanders just weeks after Russia invaded. They arrived at the air base, near the Romanian coastal city of Constanta, over the summer. The base previously served as a sleepy outpost for training NATO troops, including several hundred American soldiers, and was known more broadly in the military as a way station with a small mess hall for U.S. forces heading to and from Afghanistan.The mission here is somewhat different from those elsewhere in Europe, where some U.S. troops are training Ukrainian forces on advanced weapons systems that are being shipped to the Ukrainians. The division's commander, Maj. Gen. J.P. McGee, said that training with other Eastern European soldiers had its own value.""You get a chance to train and operate on the very ground that you might have to defend,"" General McGee said.He added: ""You have to work with a NATO ally, and it's almost unimaginable in the future that we would ever go fight without allies.""In addition to the troops in Romania, General McGee has also sent smaller teams of soldiers to train with NATO allies in Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary and Slovakia. The unit prides itself on being the closest one to the combat, but it is by no means the largest: Officials said that an estimated 12,000 troops attached to the Army's First Infantry Division, added after the invasion, are based mostly in western Poland and the Baltics.Together, they represent a buildup of U.S. forces in Europe since Russia invaded Ukraine, as Mr. Biden promised allies at a NATO summit meeting in Madrid in June.As part of military exercises with American and British forces, Romanian troops have been testing the HIMARS rocket launching systems -- the same weapons that have helped Ukraine push Russian forces into retreat -- against simulated targets in the Black Sea over the past few months. Romania bought three of the rocket systems years ago, and officials said they are still in the process of being delivered.Lt. Gen. Iulian Berdila, chief of the Romanian land forces -- who has welcomed the deployment -- said regional officials had been warning the West of ""incremental and toxic"" advances by Russia since it seized control of Crimea from Ukraine in a 2014 local referendum that much of the world views as illegal.""We've been very attentive to what Russia does, and what are the consequences,"" General Berdila said. Of the training with U.S. troops, he said, ""We've war-gamed together the different scenarios and are prepared to synchronize plans as we speak.""The number and senior command level of American forces currently in Romania are enough, he said, for ""predictable deterrence and defense together.""General McConville would not predict what the Biden administration might do in Romania, but broadly speaking, he said the troops at the air base had ""really made a difference, and I think we will continue to provide those capabilities as required.""Having a division commander and staff so close to the border with Ukraine is more than symbolic, said Becca Wasser, a war analyst at the Center for a New American Security, a research institute in Washington. It allows for quick decisions about where to position thousands of troops and weapons should Russia push the war into NATO territory.""What you are seeing is indicative of a change in how the U.S. military is approaching posture and deployments around the globe as the era of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have changed,"" Ms. Wasser said. ""It's not necessarily going to be this combat deployment -- what you really have is a deterrence deployment.""It is the same kind of mission, Ms. Wasser said, that was undertaken by tens of thousands of American troops sent to bases across the U.S. Central Command in 2020 as tensions with Iran flared across the Middle East.For Command Sgt. Maj. Vitalia Sanders, who leads a battalion at Mihail Kogalniceanu air base, the mission is as personal as it is professional.She was born in a town outside Uzhhorod, in western Ukraine, and moved to northwest Indiana when she was 12 to live with her grandmother. She was last in Ukraine in 2005, and her brother is still there -- although their communications over WhatsApp and Facebook have been limited because Russian strikes have taken out power grids.Sergeant Major Sanders has been in the U.S. Army for 21 years, and served in Afghanistan and Kuwait. But she never forgot the threat that Russia posed to Ukraine.""Just being here, so close to home,"" she said, ""makes me hungry and makes me fight, and hopefully spreads that energy to soldiers to let them know how important this is for everybody.""Photograph Maj.

Ukrainian Strike Exposes Mistakes By Putin's Forces:   [Foreign Desk ],Invasions; Rockets; Casualties; War; Military air strikes,"A Ukrainian attack with U.S.-made rockets may have left hundreds of casualties, and pro-war Russians accused their military commanders of repeating fatal errors.In one of their deadliest attacks yet on Russian forces, Ukrainians used American-made rockets to kill dozens -- and perhaps hundreds -- of Moscow's troops in a New Year's Day strike behind the lines, prompting outraged Russian war hawks to accuse their military of lethal incompetence.The strike by the HIMARS rockets killed 63 Russian soldiers in a building housing them in the occupied city of Makiivka, in eastern Ukraine, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Monday -- an unusual admission for a military that has often refused to acknowledge serious losses. A former Russian paramilitary commander in Ukraine, Igor Girkin, wrote on the Telegram app that ""many hundreds"" were dead and wounded and that many ""remained under the rubble.""Ukrainian military officials said it appeared that ""about 400"" Russian troops had been killed, though they did not explicitly say that Kyiv was behind the attack.None of the claims could be independently verified, but even the lowest number would represent one of the worst Russian losses in a single episode in the war, and an embarrassment for President Vladimir V. Putin. He has vowed repeatedly to correct the glaring errors and weaknesses in his armed forces that the war has exposed, and in a New Year's Eve speech filmed at a military base, Mr. Putin told the families of soldiers killed in the fighting, ""I share your pain with all my heart.""Pro-war Russian bloggers and some government officials said the debacle was caused by the military's own repeated and costly mistakes, like garrisoning troops in a dense concentration within range of Ukrainian artillery, placing them in the same building as an ammunition depot, and allowing them to use cellphones, whose signals the Ukrainians can use to zero in on their target.""Our generals are untrainable in principle,"" wrote Mr. Girkin, who has used the nom de guerre Igor Strelkov.Some pro-war lawmakers demanded an investigation, and one of them, Sergei Mironov, leader of a pro-Kremlin party in the Parliament, called for the prosecution of all officials responsible, ""whether they wear epaulets or not.""""Obviously neither intelligence nor counterintelligence or air defense worked properly,"" he said.The attack was ""a massive blow,"" said a spokesman for the Russian-installed proxy government in the Donetsk region, Daniil Bezsonov. ""The enemy inflicted the most serious defeats in this war on us not because of their coolness and talent, but because of our mistakes,"" he wrote in a Telegram post.More than 10 months after an invasion that Russians -- and many Ukrainians -- thought would produce a quick Russian victory, each side has suffered more than 100,000 killed and wounded, by Western estimates, and the war has become one of attrition, with no evidence of an end in sight.Some of the heaviest recent fighting has ravaged the Donetsk region, one of four the Kremlin claimed to annex in September even as its troops were losing ground there, giving up towns they had seized earlier in the war. Since then combat in the region has slowed to a bloody slog, as the Ukrainians look for places to press their advantage, while Russians build trenches and fortifications along the front lines and try to capture the city of Bakhmut.On Monday, Russia launched a flurry of Iranian-made exploding drones at Ukraine, continuing its barrage against cities and civilian infrastructure, especially the power grid. But it appeared that Ukraine's increasingly effective air defenses once again minimized the damage.The Ukrainian military said on Monday that 22 drones were shot down over Kyiv in the early-morning hours, but at least two loud explosions were heard in the city. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said some energy infrastructure facilities had been damaged, affecting systems that heat buildings. It was not clear if the explosions were caused by drones that evaded air defenses, by drones that were shot down but detonated on hitting the ground, or by air defense missiles.The Ukraine military said it had shot down all 45 Iranian Shahed drones launched over the weekend, though some cruise missiles penetrated its defenses.In his nightly video address, President Volodomyr Zelensky warned on Monday, ""We have information that Russia is planning a prolonged attack with Shaheds,"" aiming to exhaust Ukraine's defenses and its ability to endure. He said, ""Now is the time when everyone involved in the protection of the sky should be especially attentive.""The deadly attack on Russian forces in Makiivka used the HIMARS rocket artillery to hit a vocational school where troops were housed, Moscow said. The Russian Defense Ministry said that four HIMARS rockets had hit the building, and that two others had been shot down by Russian air defenses.As pro-war bloggers and officials reacted with fury, video posted on social media showed firefighters amid the ruins of the structure, reduced to smoking piles of rubble. The bloggers have become influential opinion-makers in Russia amid the censorship of mainstream media.Mr. Girkin, the blogger and former paramilitary commander, wrote that the vocational school in Makiivka had been ""almost completely destroyed"" because ""ammunition stored in the same building"" detonated in the strike. The ammunition was stored ""without the slightest sign of disguise,"" he wrote, adding that similar strikes had occurred earlier this year, albeit with fewer casualties.Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, noted that the Russian officials ""do not typically provide this type of information after a major loss, which suggests they want to control the narrative on this event.""Makiivka, adjacent to the city of Donetsk, lies only about 10 miles from the nearest Ukrainian-held territory, the town of Avdiivka to the northwest -- well within the roughly 50-mile range of the HIMARS rockets the United States has sent to Ukraine. A U.S. military official declined to comment on the strike.HIMARS, which fires satellite-guided rockets from mobile launchers, is part of a growing arsenal of sophisticated Western weapons that have helped Ukraine change the course of the conflict.Since the Biden administration began supplying the weapons system in June, HIMARS has greatly increased the range and precision of the outgunned Ukrainians. They have used it to hit targets far behind the front lines, like the main bridge linking the city of Kherson to Russian-held territory, which contributed to the Russian decision to abandon the city.Last month, a Ukrainian HIMARS attack destroyed a hotel in the city of Kadiivka, in the Luhansk region northeast of Donetsk. That attack killed members of Kremlin-aligned Wagner paramilitary group who were using the hotel as a base, according to Ukrainian authorities in the region.The HIMARS system is most effective when used against stationary targets that can be identified in advance and pinpointed, such as ammunition dumps, infrastructure or troop concentrations. The United States has so far supplied Ukraine with at least 20 HIMARS systems, which are made by Lockheed Martin.Many soldiers who were casualties appeared to be new recruits, recently mobilized in Mr. Putin's drive to conscript more men into the fighting in Ukraine. One report in Russian state media said that ""active use of cellular phones by the newly arrived servicemen"" had been a prime reason for the attack, helping Ukrainian forces to pinpoint their location.Throughout the war, Russian soldiers in Ukraine have spoken on open cellphone lines, often revealing their positions and exposing the disarray in their ranks. Though the continued use of the phones, despite the devastating consequences, exposes a failing by the military command, military bloggers say this explanation shifts the blame onto the victims.It does not address why Russian commanders housed so many conscripts in an unprotected building within reach of U.S.-made rockets.""No one is assuming the responsibility for the needless deaths,"" one blogger, Anastasia Kashevarova, wrote on Telegram.Eric Schmitt and Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting.Eric Schmitt and Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting.Photograph Ukrainians fired a mortar round toward Russian forces in the Donetsk region on Sunday.

"In Wave of Strikes, Russian Missiles Kill 12 Across Ukraine",Invasions; Missiles; Armed forces,"Enlarge this image.KYIV, Ukraine — Russia fired dozens of missiles at Ukrainian cities Thursday, piercing snow clouds and air defenses to kill at least 12 people across the country in the Kremlin’s campaign to punish civilians while its army fights in Ukraine’s east.The wave of strikes came a day after Germany and the United States pledged to send dozens of battle tanks to Ukraine, a significant step up in Western military support. Ukraine managed to shoot down 47 of the 55 missiles, according to its air force command, including 20 in the area around the capital, Kyiv.But a variety of Russian strikes still killed 11 people across 11 regions, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said. Another 11 people were wounded, and 35 buildings were damaged, it said.A 12th civilian was killed later in the day when a Russian rocket hit a village council building in Kochubeivka, a tiny community in the Kherson region, a military official said on Telegram.As it has for months, Russia appeared to target Ukraine’s energy grid in subfreezing winter weather. “The main goal is energy facilities providing Ukrainians with light and heat,” Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in a post on Telegram.Since October, Russia has launched more than a dozen major waves of missiles and drones on Ukraine’s energy facilities, as well as many smaller attacks, in a campaign to impair the power supply and leave civilians without power, heat and light over winter.The barrages have sometimes come after Ukrainian successes, such as its fall campaigns in the northeast and the south, but have continued as the pace of fighting has slowed to a grueling battle of attrition in the east and south.The missile strikes have often landed in residential areas as well, sometimes to devastating effect, as when more than 40 people were killed in a strike on an apartment building in Dnipro, in central Ukraine.Large booms shook Kyiv about 10 a.m. local time Thursday, sending residents fleeing into subway shelters and basements. The mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said one person had been killed and two wounded when a projectile hit a building in the city’s south.At least one blast could be heard on camera, interrupting an interview that a member of Ukraine’s parliament was giving to broadcaster Sky News. “Where was it?” a woman asks in the video, as the lawmaker and journalist stand amid destroyed Russian tanks. “Not far away.”Three people were killed in a Russian strike on infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia, the state prosecutor general’s office said on Telegram. There were also reports of missile strikes in the Vinnytsia region in western Ukraine and outside the port city of Odesa, causing “massive power outages” there, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba.France’s foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, was in Odesa on Thursday to meet with Kuleba — diplomatic talks that were literally forced underground by the Russian strikes.“Thanks to a Russian missile, I experienced my 1st diplomatic bilateral meeting in a shelter,” Colonna tweeted Thursday, sharing a photo of the ministers at a table in a bare room. “Coffee was warm, merci!”Kuleba, who noted that Odesa’s historic center was designated a world heritage site in danger this week by UNESCO, said on Twitter that the meeting was “probably the first time in history when Foreign Ministers hold talks in the basement of an Opera House.”The UN agency’s designation gives the city, which was conquered in the late 18th century by the Russian Empire and given the name Odesa by the empress Catherine the Great, “access to reinforced technical and financial international assistance,” UNESCO said. “Ukraine may request this to ensure the protection of the property and, if necessary, assist in reconstruction if attacked.”Colonna said the ministers had discussed French support for Ukraine, saying, “Our assistance will continue in all areas and for as long as necessary.”Kuleba — who joked that the French minister was “the Catherine I’m pleased to see in Odesa” — has pressed Ukraine’s supporters in Europe and the United States to significantly increase their military aid. Not long after Germany and the United States announced they would send dozens of battle tanks to Ukraine, he called for “Western-type fighter jets.”Ukrainian officials have argued that such warplanes would help them defend against Russia’s missile volleys.For the past week, Russia’s air force has been conducting exercises north of Ukraine in Belarus, keeping Ukraine on heightened alert. Countrywide air attack sirens have sounded each time Russian planes take to the air.Overnight, according to Ukraine’s air force command, Ukraine’s air defenses shot down 24 Iranian-made Shahed exploding drones.Both the United States and Germany have pledged Patriot air-defense missile batteries to Ukraine, and the U.S. military is training Ukrainian troops in Oklahoma on how to use the weapon, which is the most advanced U.S. ground-based air-defense system.The Biden administration has significantly increased its military aid to Ukraine over the past year, gradually expanding the array of arms it has agreed to provide to include HIMARS rocket artillery systems in the summer, Stryker armored fighting vehicles, Patriot missiles and, now, M1 Abrams tanks. Britain has promised to send some of its Challenger 2 tanks, while Germany has agreed to supply some of its Leopard 2 tanks and to allow other countries to give theirs to Ukraine.Military experts and Western officials say they believe that Ukraine and Russia will both attempt offensives in the spring, as Ukraine puts to use the heavy weapons sent from the West and Russia deploys the huge numbers of men it drafted last year.“The spring and summer look like they’re going to be fairly decisive,” said Michael Kofman, director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Virginia. Speaking on the podcast “War on the Rocks” this week, Kofman said that in its next offensive, Ukraine would have “a strong opportunity to show that it can continue retaking territory.”But unlike its past offensives in the Kharkiv region to the northeast and the Kherson region to the south, “the next offensive comes with risk,” he said. “If it’s not successful, Ukraine faces the real danger of a counteroffensive.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.",1.0

U.S. Extends Its Troops At War's Edge:   [Foreign Desk ],Invasions; Military personnel; Armed forces,"The buildup is part of President Biden's commitment to increase American forces in Europe in response to the Russian invasion last February.The Pentagon will keep several thousand American troops in southeast Romania for at least nine more months, closer to the war in neighboring Ukraine than any other U.S. Army unit, officials said on Saturday.Over the last year, the sprawling Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base, just a seven-minute rocket flight across the Black Sea from where Russian forces have settled in Crimea, has become a training hub for NATO forces in southeast Europe. The forces would be a first line of defense should Russia invade further west.There are around 4,000 U.S. soldiers with the 101st Airborne Division who have been stationed at the air base since last summer, including small groups of troops that frequently train right on Romania's border with Ukraine. Before that, there was a smaller contingent from the 82nd Airborne that was sent as part of a quick-response force after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February.The 101st Airborne Division troops will leave in the next two months, and officials said they would be replaced by a different brigade from the 101st Division, which is based at Fort Campbell, Ky.Additionally, officials said, the mission will be led by the senior staff, including its two-star general and top planners, from the 10th Mountain Division, based in Ft. Drum, N.Y., for what is expected to be a nine-month deployment.Prior to Saturday, it had not been clear whether the Pentagon would keep the senior-level unit at the air base on Romania or move its forces elsewhere.Sending a two-star general that close to the combat zone, military analysts have said, would allow for quick decisions about where to position troops and weapons should Russia push the war into NATO territory.The move ""would ensure the United States continues to be well positioned to provide a robust deterrent and defensive posture alongside our allies across the European continent,"" the Army said in a statement on Saturday. ""The United States will continue to adjust its posture as needed in response to the dynamic security environment.""The buildup was part of President Biden's commitment in June to increase American forces in Europe in response to Russia's invasion. That also included about 12,000 American troops, currently based in western Poland, to work with NATO forces in Poland and the Baltics.Supporters of maintaining a strong presence in Eastern Europe have pointed to Russia's attack as proof that the United States and its NATO allies did not do enough to deter Moscow last winter.The American forces in Romania are training soldiers from NATO allies in Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary and Slovakia. Though they are among the closest units to the combat, they are not training Ukrainian forces on advanced weapons systems that are being shipped to the Ukrainians.Romanian military officials have welcomed the American troops as a force large enough to ensure what Lt.

"Safe at Home in Dnipro, Until a Russian Missile Struck:   [Foreign Desk ]",War; Military air strikes,"DNIPRO, Ukraine -- A Russian missile as long as a city bus was nearing the end of a roughly 300-mile flight, its 2,000-pound warhead armed to detonate on impact.As it was descending through a gray sky last Saturday, traveling at supersonic speed, Rostyslav Yaroshenko, 12, was watching TikTok videos in his kitchen on the third floor at 118 Victory Embankment, a sprawling apartment complex in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Six floors up, Yevgeniy Botvynov had just curled up with his wife, Olha, under a blanket, trying to keep warm during yet another power outage.On the other side of the building, two couples had gathered in their kitchens on the fourth floor, one of them warming a late lunch, the other doting on their 1-year-old son.It was what passes for an ordinary Saturday for ordinary Ukrainian people these days, in a place far from the front lines of the war with Russia, but never fully at peace. All day, air-raid warnings were sounding, forcing people to make calculations that have become habitual: Go to a shelter or stay home? Take the elevator or the stairs?Most of the time, life appears to be normal. And then, suddenly, it does not.Around 3:40 p.m. on the 325th day of Russia's full-fledged war in Ukraine, an ordinary Saturday turned extraordinary when the Russian Kh-22 missile slammed into 118 Victory Embankment.More than 30 apartments were instantly incinerated, with nothing left but a column of swirling ash. Along the singed periphery, some units were sliced apart with almost surgical precision, exposing the contents of people's living rooms, bathrooms and kitchens to the open air. A bowl of fruit sat unscathed on the table in one kitchen that had been opened up like a dollhouse; in another unit, a painting of a dog hung crookedly on a kitchen wall -- though the kitchen was no longer there.On Thursday, the authorities raised the death toll to 46, including six children; 80 were wounded. It was one of the deadliest single attacks against civilians since the early weeks of the war.The apartment building, an enormous Soviet-era edifice, forms a large inverted J that curls around an internal courtyard, with the largest section facing the Dnipro River. An estimated 1,700 people called it home.The missile hit just above the joint where the building began to curve away from the embankment. For those at the center of the impact, death came instantly: The explosion simply vaporized some residents, according to the authorities.Olha Usova, a 36-year-old dentist, happened to be walking by on her way to a newly opened gym when the missile struck. A single piece of shrapnel pierced her heart, her husband, Eduard, said, killing her instantly. He said he felt that with normal attacks, you had a decent chance of surviving just by remaining indoors. This one was different.""In this case,"" he said, ""such a rocket left no chance for survival.""Many did manage to survive, but that often depended on where in their homes they were at the moment of impact. Many found themselves trapped, the missile's force having sheared off the stairwells on two sides of the building.Mr. Botvynov, who had been cuddling with his wife under a blanket, first had to pull himself free from the twisted remains of a balcony that had crashed through his living room. Then he grabbed his heavily bleeding wife and rushed to the front door. When he opened it, there was nothing but a nine-story drop into the smoking rubble below.Across the void, he saw a woman curled in fetal position, partly buried in debris from her destroyed apartment.""I thought that it was a corpse,"" said Mr. Botvynov, 48. ""And then I see her waving her hand.""It is impossible to say whether the apartment complex in Dnipro was hit intentionally. The Kh-22 is a 1960s-era anti-ship missile launched by Russian bombers that is designed to attack warships at sea, and it may have more limited abilities to accurately attack targets on land.A power station directly across the river from the complex could have been an intended target, part of Russia's strategy of starving Ukrainians of electricity, though it was roughly two miles away. The Kremlin has denied that a Russian missile was involved, blaming an errant Ukrainian air-defense missile. Military experts have dismissed this claim as yet another Russian fabrication, pointing to the colossal damage.The day of the attack was a holiday in Ukraine, when many celebrate what is known as Old New Year, based on the Orthodox Church's pre-modern calendar. That made Olha Afanasieva, 49, anxious. After 11 months of war, Ukrainians believe that the Kremlin takes a twisted pleasure in attacking on holidays.""For me, it was such an anxious day,"" she said, adding that she had insisted that her husband not go fishing as planned. ""I felt like something was about to happen.""Ms. Afanasieva's husband, Oleh Valovyi, took things in stride, though. Rockets had rained down on a number of cities that day, and the entire country was under an alert for hours.""There are not that many bomb shelters,"" Mr. Valovyi said, ""and you get tired of running there because the air-raid alarms sound practically every day, several times a day.""The couple were seated at their kitchen table when the missile hit, she with her left side facing a window, he directly in front of it. The blast blew out the window, and glass and debris shredded half of Ms. Afanasieva's face. But her husband bore the brunt of it.""He was just all black and bloody,"" she said. ""His face started to turn black under the eyes, and all that, my God.""Finding their apartment door jammed, she went to the window screaming and waving a towel and a bathrobe, trying to catch the attention of firefighters who had started assembling below.At the same time, Mr. Botvynov, facing the nine-story drop with no stairs, was frantically signaling with his cellphone's flashlight, worried that his wife, who was bleeding profusely from her head, would lose consciousness.On the fourth floor, Kateryna Zelenska, who is 27 and deaf, was trapped under the rubble, unable to signal emergency workers. Her husband, Oleksii Zelensky, 28, and their 1-year-old son, Mykyta, were somewhere nearby, but she did not know their conditions. Slabs of concrete had collapsed onto their apartment from the floors above. Somehow, Ms. Zelenska managed to make a brief call to her mother, apparently to say goodbye.""She said, 'Mom, I love you, I love you,' and that's it, it broke off,"" her mother, Oksana Kulak, said through tears.Over the next 24 hours, rescuers using cranes and ladders saved dozens of people trapped on upper floors. It took about three hours to reach Mr. Botvynov and his wife. Ms. Afanasieva got out first, but said she regretted leaving her husband to manage by himself. He passed out on the balcony as firefighters were trying to guide him onto a platform atop a ladder.Later at the hospital, he was in surprisingly good spirits for someone whose body had been pierced by glass head to toe. But he expressed confusion over Russia's choice of target.""I work at a company that deals with agriculture, selling parts for the tractors, a completely peaceful profession,"" he said. ""Surely, my death would not have any military significance.""How rescuers noticed Ms. Zelenska, the deaf woman, is unclear, but by Sunday morning, firefighters attached to safety lines and standing on a platform suspended by a crane were working furiously at the spot where her apartment had been. They cut away debris for hours. Finally, she appeared covered in dust, alive but visibly distressed.For the next 48 hours, firefighters continued to hack at the concrete slabs that had pancaked onto Ms. Zelenska's apartment, searching for her husband and son.By Tuesday morning, the couple's families had gathered at the site in what was a mostly silent vigil, until, as the sun came up, Ms. Zelenska's father, Mykola Kulak, vented his anger.""The Russians, let them all perish, these devils,"" he screamed, holding up his phone to show a video of his grandson. ""This child is still lying under the rubble! I am cursing them, and I wish that every Russian family has two or three, just like this, lying there like our child.""Shortly afterward, rescuers brought down the bodies -- first Mykyta, then Oleksii -- using a special crane. They were placed on the ground in black body bags as their family waited to carry out the wrenching task of identifying them.Oleksii's parents knelt in front of their son's body, unzipped the bag and for several interminable minutes caressed him, sobbing.Ms. Zelenska's parents had rushed off earlier to join their daughter, who had been hospitalized since being rescued two days earlier. She had found out on the internet that the bodies of her husband and son had been recovered, the first confirmation she had that they were dead.On Tuesday afternoon, the authorities declared an end to the search, but by evening, firefighters had returned to 118 Victory Embankment for an unexpected rescue mission. One that came at the behest of Rostyslav, the boy who had been watching TikTok videos before the missile hit.He had managed to escape his mangled apartment by climbing out a window and scrambling down the building's facade with the help of bystanders. But in the confusion, he had been unable to locate his white cat, Belyash.""I was more frightened for my cat,"" he said.And so firefighters once again climbed into the building as Rostyslav, his mother, Nadiia, and a small crowd of onlookers gathered in the darkness below. After about 20 minutes, a firefighter emerged from the kitchen window, a red and white cat carrier in hand. Inside, was a dirty and frightened Belyash.""We're going home,"" said Rostyslav, peering into the carrier when at last he and his pet were reunited.

South Africa to Hold Naval Drill With Russia Despite Ukraine War:   [Correction ],Diplomatic & consular services; Military exercises; Alliances,"The move was criticized by the U.S., which has been trying to rally other countries to isolate Russia over the war in Ukraine.JOHANNESBURG -- South Africa's military said on Thursday that it planned to hold joint training exercises off its coast next month with Russia and China, a move criticized by the United States, which has been trying to rally other countries to isolate Russia over the war in Ukraine.The exercises will coincide with the first anniversary of the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb 24. South Africa was among three dozen countries that abstained last year in a vote at the United Nations General Assembly to condemn Russia for its claim to have annexed several regions of Ukraine.South Africa has conducted military exercises with Russia and China before, as well as with the United States and NATO countries. The South African National Defense Force said that the upcoming drills, to be held from Feb. 17-27 near the coastal towns of Durban and Richards Bay, were a ""means to strengthen the already flourishing relations between South Africa, Russia and China.""The United States, which has fostered a decades-long strategic partnership with South Africa, immediately expressed disapproval. David Feldmann, a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, said in a statement, ""We note with concern"" the plan by South Africa to move ahead with the joint exercises ""even as Moscow continues its brutal and unlawful invasion of Ukraine.""He added, ""We encourage South Africa to cooperate militarily with fellow democracies that share our mutual commitment to human rights and the rule of law.""The naval drill is a show of diplomatic independence for South Africa, analysts said. South Africa is part of an alliance with Brazil, Russia, India and China -- known by the acronym BRICS -- and this naval exercise reasserts South Africa's position that it will not allow the conflict between Russia and Ukraine to dictate its diplomatic relations.""It is seen as a war that is happening in Europe, and as far as South Africa is concerned, it's not part of this war,"" said Denys Reva, a maritime researcher with the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa.Photograph A sanctioned Russian container ship, center left, docked in South Africa's naval port outside Cape Town, last month.

Russian Forces Press Toward Bakhmut:   [Live Blog Post ],Aircraft,"Russian forces were shelling villages close to the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities said on Wednesday, as Moscow pressed ahead with its campaign to encircle and capture the nearby city of Bakhmut, the site of some of the fiercest recent battles in the war.Questions have swirled about the fate of Soledar, a small salt-mining town that Russia claims to have captured even as Ukraine has said in recent days that it was still holding on there. But there is growing evidence that the Ukrainian forces have withdrawn under pressure, analysts said, leaving Russia's forces in control of a town that is one of a ring around Bakhmut, a city that Moscow sees as key to its goal of taking the whole eastern area known as Donbas.The town's fall would be a small but concrete advance for Russian forces, which have been dealt setbacks in recent months, losing territory in the fall to Ukrainian counteroffensives in the northeastern region of Kharkiv and the southern region of Kherson.Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the military administration in the Donetsk region, where Soledar and Bakhmut are, said that Russian forces had shelled a handful of villages overnight to the north and west of Soledar. There was no immediate information on casualties in the attacks, he said in a post on the Telegram messaging app, describing the situation in Soledar as ""tense.""Over the weekend, the founder of the Wagner private mercenary group that has been at the forefront of Russia's forces in the area issued a video that appeared to show two Wagner soldiers walking at ease through Soledar, suggesting that they were in control. It was not possible to confirm the authenticity of the video, which followed a statement by Russia's Defense Ministry on Friday that it had seized the city.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Monday that the battle for the city and for the whole of Luhansk and Donetsk, the two regions that make up Donbas, was continuing ""without any respite, without any stop.""On Wednesday, however, a British military intelligence report said that by the end of Monday ""Ukrainian forces had highly likely withdrawn"" from Soledar, ""leaving Russian military and Wagner group proxy forces in control.""In essence, Moscow holds the territory east of Bakhmut running to the Russian border, while Ukraine largely holds the land to the west.""Ukrainian forces have likely established new defensive lines to the west,"" the intelligence report said. It did not cite a source, though the information about new Ukrainian defensive lines appeared to be consistent with Mr. Kyrylenko's report of increased fighting west of Soledar. The town had a population of about 10,000 before the war but now is largely deserted.Bakhmut is a road hub, and Russia's recent gains threaten two of the routes running north through which Ukrainian forces have brought in reinforcements and munitions for the defense of the city, Britain's Defense Ministry said.Ukrainian anti-aircraft gunners had shot down two Russian fighter aircraft near Soledar in the previous 24 hours, the general staff said on Wednesday, as well as hitting two command posts and an ammunition dump.A Ukrainian soldier on the front line near the town of Soledar in Donetsk region, where Russian forces were shelling villages.

"15 Are Killed at Border in Egypt, Officials Say:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"CAIRO -- At least 15 Sudanese migrants trying to cross from Egypt into Israel were shot and killed at the border early Sunday, possibly by Egyptian police officers, according to security officials and news reports.The death toll, if confirmed, would be one of the highest in years for migrants and asylum seekers making the treacherous journey across the Sinai Peninsula into Israel. People coming from Sudan, Eritrea and other countries in East Africa have been tortured by traffickers, beaten or shot by the Egyptian security services and have faced open-ended detention by the Israeli authorities, according to human rights groups.The circumstances of Sunday's shooting were unclear, and Egyptian government officials refused to comment on the deaths. A senior security official in northern Sinai, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, said that the Egyptian border police had shot the migrants when they ignored warnings not to cross the border fence. Fifteen were killed and at least eight others wounded, the official said, adding that another eight migrants had been arrested.But another Egyptian security official said that the Sudanese migrants had been caught in the middle of a shootout between Bedouin smugglers and the Egyptian police, and that they had been killed in the crossfire. And Reuters, citing security sources, said the police had found the migrants' bodies near the border.It was impossible to reconcile the conflicting accounts. Egypt's government, which has been battling an insurgency in northern Sinai for several years, severely restricts access for the news media to towns in the area, as well as to the border zone.Human rights groups have been warning of the perils facing migrants in Sinai for the last decade. A 2008 report by Human Rights Watch said that the Egyptian police had killed at least 33 migrants trying to cross into Israel over a 17-month period. Despite the danger on the Egyptian side, Israeli officials routinely returned the migrants, putting them into Egyptian custody, the report said.Even before the migrants reach the frontier, they have faced torture, sexual assault and other abuse by traffickers demanding money -- essentially ransom -- from the migrants' families in their home countries, human rights groups say.The flow of migrants has slowed over the last three years as northern Sinai has been transformed into a military zone, and as Israel has completed a huge steel fence, topped with barbed wire, along the border. But many still brave the risks. This month, Egyptian security forces shot at a group of asylum seekers, mostly from Sudan, near the border, killing one person and wounding five others, according to a report in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.",1.0
Strategy Shift for ISIS: Inflicting Terror in Distant Lands:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Defying Western efforts to confront the Islamic State on the battlefield, the group has evolved in its reach and organizational ability, with increasingly dangerous hubs outside Iraq and Syria and strategies that call for using spectacular acts of violence against civilians.But even as the militant attacks were playing out across Paris on Friday night, the United States carried out an airstrike -- planned days in advance -- against the leader of the Islamic State in Libya, which has emerged as a pivotal stronghold for the group in North Africa. American and British Special Operations forces have for months been conducting secret surveillance missions in Libya to monitor the rise of fighters aligned with the Islamic State.The massacre in Paris on Friday, following bombings in Beirut, Lebanon, and the downing of a Russian passenger jet over Egypt, all claimed by the Islamic State, reveals a terrorist organization that has changed in significant ways from the West's initial understanding of it as a group focused on holding territory in Syria and Iraq and building a caliphate, or Islamic state.And actions by the United States and its allies -- including a Western bombing campaign of Islamic State-held fighting positions and oil facilities, coordinated with a ground offensive by Kurdish forces to cut off a major supply line -- foreshadow how the West might respond to the growing menace in the coming weeks.The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh, has for the first time engaged in what appears to be a centrally planned campaign of terrorist attacks aimed at inflicting huge civilian casualties on distant territory, forcing many counterterrorism officials in the United States and in Europe to recalibrate their assessment of the group.""They have crossed some kind of Rubicon,"" said William McCants, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and author of ""The ISIS Apocalypse."" ""They have definitely shifted in their thinking about targeting their enemies.""When the Islamic State's Egyptian arm claimed responsibility for blowing up a Russian charter plane over Sinai two weeks ago, some analysts wondered if the group's so-called Sinai Province of the Islamic State had acted on its own and leapt out in front, even at the cost of risking a Russian military backlash on the parent group in Syria and Iraq.But the attacks last week in Paris and Beirut, which the Islamic State also said it carried out, appear to have settled that question and convinced even skeptics that the central leadership was calling the shots.""There is a radical change of perception by the terrorists that they can now act in Paris just as they act in Syria or Baghdad,"" said Mathieu Guidère, a terrorism specialist at the University of Toulouse. ""With this action, a psychological barrier has been broken.""Indeed, at a time when many Western officials were most concerned about Islamic State-inspired, lone-wolf attacks -- terrifying in their randomness but relatively low in casualties -- the attacks in Paris have revived the specter of coordinated, high-casualty attacks planned with the involvement of a relatively large number of perpetrators.American and European authorities said the Paris assault bore the hallmarks of complex attacks conducted by Al Qaeda, or of the Mumbai plot in 2008, when 10 Islamic militants carried out a series of 12 shootings and bombings in the Indian city, lasting four days and killing 164 people.""Their goal is an unconventional urban guerrilla war,"" said Franck Chaix, an officer of the Gendarmerie, France's semi-military police force, and a former head of its special intervention force, G.I.G.N.Al Qaeda, the Islamic State's principal forebear, built its identity around spectacular terrorist attacks because its leaders saw themselves as insurgents seeking to overturn Arab governments that they deemed apostates. Al Qaeda wanted to bait the West into military actions that would destabilize Arab states. The Islamic State, in contrast, has increasingly styled itself a state and, in many ways, behaved like one.The ideology and motivation behind the change may be opaque for years. Analysts suggest that the messianic and apocalyptic side of its jihadist ideology may have gotten the better of the pragmatic impulse that had previously appeared to guide the group's expansion. Or, experts say, the Islamic State may be seeking to use large terrorist attacks the way a more conventional power might use an air force as a tool of its defense policy, to retaliate against enemy attacks and seek to deter them.But, if so, its tactics may be shortsighted, causing redoubled Western attempts to crush the militant organization -- even as the spreading Islamic State structure makes those efforts more challenging.The attacks come against a backdrop of signs that the Islamic State's leaders based in Raqqa, Syria, may have been building closer cooperation with its two most significant affiliates, or ""provinces,"" in Libya and Egypt.The main Libyan arm of the Islamic State -- known as the Tripoli Province and centered in the midcoastal city of Sirte -- has long demonstrated the closest coordination with the group's Syrian hub. The two operations began advertising their cooperation as early as February with a video of Islamic State fighters beheading at least a dozen Egyptian Christians.Western intelligence agencies say Islamic State fighters with experience in Syria and Iraq have often turned up in Darnah, a militant stronghold east of Sirte, although the group's affiliate there was routed earlier this year in a dispute with militant rivals.The United States broadened its fight against the Islamic State in Libya on Friday night, targeting the group's senior leader there, the Pentagon said on Saturday. The airstrike took place in Darnah shortly after the attacks in Paris began, but had been in the works for several days and was not related to the events in France, American officials said.The strike was aimed at Abu Nabil, also known as Wissam Najm Abd Zayd al Zubaydi. He is an Iraqi national who led Qaeda operations in western Iraq from 2004 until 2010. He later moved to eastern Libya to lead Islamic State operations there, the officials said.Pentagon officials said they believed the strike, first reported by The Daily Beast, had killed Abu Nabil, though it would take a few days to confirm. It marked the first time the United States has targeted a senior Islamic State operative outside Iraq or Syria.Libyan news media reported last week that a senior Islamic State leader had personally visited Sirte, stirring speculation about the main group's plans for its local branch. The leader, known as Abu Ali al-Anbari, arrived ""by the sea,"" the Libyan news network 218TV reported, according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence Group.Mr. Anbari's arrival may represent what a senior Pentagon official said were signs that Libya could provide a redoubt for the Islamic State even if the group was driven completely out of Syria and Iraq.With no functioning government, Libya provides a variety of havens and hiding places for Islamic State militants, so airstrikes or other military action on Sirte would merely push them elsewhere. And unlike Syria and Iraq, Libya is a failed state surrounded by weak ones.The timing of the explosion aboard the Russian charter jet with the Islamic State attacks in Beirut and Paris is the most visible indication yet that the Sinai Province group may be taking directions from the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. If the attacks in all three countries were coordinated, some central planners must have been involved.The plane crash was also at least the second time that the Sinai Province has cited retribution for the Western campaign against the faraway Islamic State -- and not domestic Egyptian governance -- as a motive for its acts. It cited the same reasoning this August when it released a video in the Islamic State's trademark style showing the beheading of a Croatian working for a French energy company.",1.0
"Victory Bolsters Kurds, but Not U.S.-Iraq Ties:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"ISTANBUL -- It was a full two months after Islamic State militants stormed through Iraq, massacring captured troops and driving to within a few miles of Baghdad that the United States began taking direct military action in the country.The Obama administration only intervened with airstrikes after the militants were threatening the Kurdish capital, Erbil, and waging atrocities against the Yazidi minority in Sinjar, near the boundaries of Iraqi Kurdistan. That fact was immediately seized on by Iraqi politicians, who accused the United States of being more concerned about protecting the Kurds than Iraq's Arab majority.Now, with Kurdish forces backed by American air power driving jihadist fighters out of Sinjar on Friday, the United States-led coalition appears to have a new and important victory against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.But it may come with a cost: the further undermining of the Iraqi government's authority, and intensified concern about the Kurds' desire for independence. Political figures in Baghdad are again sounding alarmed, both about the United States' reliability as an ally and about the unity of country.The Kurdish capture of Sinjar, with no Iraqi military forces in sight, offers the Kurdistan Regional Government a chance to claim control over a city that before the Islamic State invasion was nominally under the control of Baghdad.The president of the Kurdish government, Massoud Barzani, made that intention clear, holding a news conference on Mount Sinjar in which he pointedly referred to Sinjar as being a part of Kurdistan -- and pointedly ignored the role that rival Kurdish groups played in retaking the city.The result is likely to further embolden the Kurdish government as its pushes toward its goal of statehood, something the United States has opposed, while further alienating an Iraqi government that has become closer to both Iran and Russia. Russia in particular has been more active in the region, expanding its military role in the Syrian war next door and establishing a joint intelligence command center in Baghdad with the Iraqi, Iranian and Syrian governments, over the objections of American officials.As if to drive home their complaint with the United States, a delegation of Iraqi lawmakers visited Moscow on Friday to talk about more Russian military involvement in Iraq -- a development that would further challenge both American influence in Iraq and the Obama administration's long-term strategy to defeat the Islamic State.Ayham Kamel, the director for the Middle East and North Africa at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy firm, said, ""The Sinjar operation will remind the key decision makers in Baghdad that the U.S. has a broader sense of strategic cooperation with the Kurds than with Baghdad.""""The quick gains here against ISIS,"" Mr. Kamel added, ""are going to undermine the broader picture of the unity of Iraq.""The liberation of Sinjar allowed the Kurds to again expand the borders of their region at the expense of the central government. The biggest prize came last year when Kurdish forces took control of Kirkuk and its vast oil fields, territory long disputed by Arabs and Kurds that experts worry could spark a new, ethnic conflict if the Islamic State is defeated and the Iraqi Army is revitalized.Even as the Kurds celebrated victory in Sinjar, the tense relations between them and the central government erupted into violence in the disputed city of Tuz Khurmato, near Kirkuk, as Shiite militias loyal to Baghdad battled Kurdish pesh merga forces. Several people were killed, according to officials, and a hospital, a government office and dozens of homes were set on fire.There are also longstanding tensions between Baghdad and Erbil over how to share Iraq's oil revenue, an issue that became more urgent as oil prices declined and both governments faced budget crises.When the Obama administration decided last year to begin military operations against the Islamic State, first in Iraq and then in Syria, its strategy seemed simple: combining American air power with local ground forces to defeat the militant group.The Americans found that Kurdish militias in Iraq and Syria were their most reliable proxies on the ground -- as opposed to Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq that have eclipsed the struggling Iraqi security forces.In Syria, a growing relationship with Kurdish militia fighters helped lead to a military success against the Islamic State in the northern town of Kobani. Now, Kurdish forces have succeeded in Sinjar with the help of heavy American airstrikes and Special Forces advisers on the ground.But the fact is that Kurds have been willing to fight only to protect and expand territory they see as rightfully theirs, and are unlikely to play an important role in wresting the Islamic State from Sunni Arab strongholds in places like Mosul or Anbar Province in Iraq, or in Raqqa, the group's capital in Syria.Speaking about the Kurdish victory in Sinjar, Maria Fantappie, the senior Iraq analyst for the International Crisis Group, said, ""The cost of it is the fact that you don't necessarily have the means to restrain the political ambitions of this ally.""The close relationship between the United States and the Kurds in both Iraq and Syria has also complicated relationships with two of America's most important regional allies: the Iraqi and Turkish governments.""I think Sinjar adds momentum not just to the U.S. campaign against ISIS, but also U.S.-Kurdish cooperation, which builds on U.S. support for Kurdish forces in Syria,"" Ranj Alaaldin, an expert on Kurdish affairs and a doctoral researcher at the London School of Economics, wrote in an email. ""That will no doubt alarm Baghdad, Turkey, as well as the Iranians and Russians, both of which are competing with the U.S. to bring the Kurds within their orbit of influence.""In Syria, the United States has allied with the Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K., which has long been at war with the Turkish state. And the P.K.K., which is listed as a terrorist group by the United States, Turkey and other governments, was deeply involved in the battle for Sinjar this week.Dhiaa al-Asadi, an Iraqi Shiite lawmaker, said Friday that the American-Kurdish alliance in Sinjar provides ""more proof to the Iraqi government to not rely on the United States.""""The real support given to the Kurds and the fast victories against ISIS,"" he added, ""will give another pretext to look at alternatives and establish coalitions with other countries.""For some Iraqi politicians, closer ties with Russia offer an increasingly attractive alternative -- or at least an important insurance policy.""One of the possible fallouts from this operation is that Baghdad may look more closely to Russia,"" said Ahmed Ali, an Iraq analyst and senior fellow at the Institute of Regional and International Studies at the American University of Iraq.Iran, a longstanding ally of the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government whose role has complicated the United States' efforts to influence events in the region, has welcomed a deeper Russian role in Iraq. And the Kremlin appears to be open to it.After the delegation of Iraqi lawmakers met with Russian officials in Moscow on Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying, ""The Iraqi representatives emphasized their readiness to further strengthening cooperation between Moscow and Baghdad on counterterrorism matters, and they noted the possibility for Russia to continue its security assistance to the Iraqi government.""",1.0
"'Jihadi John' Likely Killed in Airstrike on ISIS Stronghold, Pentagon Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"The Pentagon said on Friday that it was ""reasonably certain"" that an American airstrike had killed Mohammed Emwazi, the Islamic State's most notorious executioner.Col. Steve Warren, a spokesman for the American-led coalition fighting the militant group, told reporters at a news briefing that the airstrike on Thursday took place near the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, Syria. He said the Pentagon was still seeking final verification that Mr. Emwazi, 27, who became known as Jihadi John, was killed in the strike.Speaking from Baghdad over a webcast, Colonel Warren said a Reaper drone fired Hellfire missiles at a car in which Mr. Emwazi and another militant were believed to be traveling. ""We know for a fact that the weapon system hit its intended target, and that the personnel who were on the receiving end of that weapons system were in fact killed,"" he said, but it remained necessary to confirm that ""those personnel were specifically who we thought they were.""Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain defended the decision to target Mr. Emwazi, a naturalized British citizen born in Kuwait, as ""an act of self-defense"" and ""the right thing to do.""""We have been working with the United States literally around the clock to track him down,"" Mr. Cameron said in London. ""This was a combined effort, and the contribution of both our countries was essential. Emwazi is a barbaric murderer.""He called the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, an ""evil terrorist death cult,"" and said of Mr. Emwazi, ""He was ISIL's lead executioner, and let us never forget that he killed many, many Muslims, too.""At a news conference in Tunis, Secretary of State John Kerry said that the airstrike should serve as a warning.""We are still assessing the results of this strike, but the terrorists associated with Daesh need to know this: Your days are numbered, and you will be defeated,"" Mr. Kerry said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. ""There is no future, no path forward for Daesh, which does not lead ultimately to its elimination, to its destruction.""Civil liberties advocates have criticized any official British attempt to kill Mr. Emwazi as possibly unlawful, in a debate that paralleled the criticism over the Obama administration's decision to target and kill Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric and a United States citizen, in Yemen in 2011.The United States considers such strikes against specific militant leaders to be lawful acts of war or self-defense, especially when it is not feasible to attempt to capture the militants but they can be struck by a missile fired from a drone or warplane.In 2014, when the United States began its air campaign against the Islamic State, the Obama administration declared the operations to be part of the existing armed conflict that Congress authorized against Al Qaeda after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The group now known as the Islamic State was a component or affiliate of Al Qaeda for years, but it split away over internal disagreements.Mr. Emwazi, who was first known only as an unidentified, masked man with a British accent, first came to prominence in August 2014, when the Islamic State released a video in which the journalist James Foley was shown reading a statement criticizing President Obama and the American military operation against the Islamic State in Iraq. His captor then beheaded him off camera and then threatened to behead another journalist, Steven J. Sotloff, if his demands were not met.Two weeks later, the Islamic State released a video showing the masked man beheading Mr. Sotloff.The Washington Post revealed Mr. Emwazi's identity in February, reporting that he grew up in a well-off family that moved to Britain when he was a child, and that he had studied computer science at the University of Westminster. The revelation touched off intense examination of the causes of radicalization among Muslim immigrants in Europe.Mr. Emwazi was part of a group of friends, called the ""North London Boys"" by some intelligence analysts, who prayed at the same mosque and became captivated by an Egyptian-born cleric, Hani al-Sibai. Mr. Sibai is thought to have close links to the Tunisian branch of Ansar al-Shariah, a Salafist group that has been linked to a deadly attack in June on tourists in Tunisia.The leader of this network was Bilal al-Berjawi, who was stripped of his British citizenship in 2011 after he went to Somalia to join the Islamist group known as the Shabab, and was killed by an American drone strike the next year. That same year, Mohamed Sakr, another friend, was also killed by a drone strike in Somalia.British officials have said that Mr. Emwazi was on a list of potential terror suspects since 2009, but that they were unable to prevent him from traveling to Syria in 2013.Mr. Foley's parents, John and Diane Foley, said they were not comforted by the news of the attack. ""If only so much effort had been given to rescuing Jim and the other hostages who were subsequently murdered by ISIS, they might be alive today,"" they said in a statement.Reg Henning, the brother of the British aid worker Alan Henning, one of Mr. Emwazi's victims, told the BBC, ""I was glad to hear he had been killed, but I would have preferred him to have been brought to justice."" A trial, he added, might have ""dragged on for months and months.""Bethany Haines, the daughter of another victim, David Cawthorne Haines, said she felt ""an instant sense of relief"" in learning about the attack, because it meant ""he wouldn't appear in anymore horrific videos.""Mr. Emwazi's other victims were Kenji Goto, a journalist, and Haruna Yukawa, an adventurer, both Japanese, and an American aid worker, Peter Kassig, also known as Abdul-Rahman Kassig.Mr. Cameron praised the American decision to target Mr. Emwazi, saying: ""The United Kingdom has no better friend or ally.""He added, ""If this strike was successful -- and we still await confirmation of that -- it will be a strike at the heart of ISIL, and it will demonstrate to those who would do Britain, our people and our allies harm we have a long reach, we have unwavering determination and we never forget about our citizens.""The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said that Mr. Emwazi should ideally have faced trial. ""It appears Mohammed Emwazi has been held to account for his callous and brutal crimes,"" Mr. Corbyn said in a statement on Friday. ""However, it would have been far better for us all if he had been held to account in a court of law. These events only underline the necessity of accelerating international efforts, under the auspices of the U.N., to bring an end to the Syrian conflict as part of a comprehensive regional settlement.""In August, a British drone strike, its first inside Syria, killed three people suspected of being members of the Islamic State, including two British citizens, Reyaad Khan and Ruhul Amin.Britain is not formally taking part in military action in Syria -- its Parliament having rejected such an intervention two years ago -- but Britain and France are involved in the American-led air campaign against Islamic State targets.In 2009, after returning from a trip to Africa, Mr. Emwazi contacted Cage, a British advocacy organization, to complain that he had been harassed by British security services.In a statement on Friday, Cage said that Mr. Emwazi ""should have been tried as a war criminal"" and expressed concern about the attack aimed at him. ""State-sponsored targeted assassinations undercut the judicial processes that provide the lessons by which spirals of violence can be stopped,"" it said.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

U.S. Steps Up Its Attacks on ISIS-Controlled Oil Fields in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ERBIL, Iraq -- The United States and its allies have sharply increased their airstrikes against the sprawling oil fields that the Islamic State controls in eastern Syria in an effort to disrupt one of the terrorist group's main sources of revenue, American officials said this week.For months, the United States has been frustrated by the Islamic State's ability to keep producing and exporting oil -- what Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter recently called ""a critical pillar of the financial infrastructure"" of the group -- which generates about $40 million a month, or nearly $500 million a year, according to Treasury Department estimates.While the American-led air campaign has conducted periodic airstrikes against oil refineries and other production facilities in eastern Syria that the group controls, the organization's engineers have been able to quickly repair damage, and keep the oil flowing, American officials said. The Obama administration has also balked at attacking the Islamic State's fleet of tanker trucks -- its main distribution network -- fearing civilian casualties.But now the administration has decided to increase the attacks and focus on inflicting damage that takes longer to fix or requires specially ordered parts, American officials said.The first evidence of the new strategy came on Oct. 21, when B-1 bombers and other allied warplanes hit 26 targets in the Omar oil field, one of the two largest oil-production sites in all of Syria. American military analysts estimate the Omar field generates $1.7 million to $5.1 million per month for the Islamic State. French warplanes struck another oil field nearby earlier this week.The goal of the operation over the next several weeks is to cripple eight major oil fields, about two-thirds of the refineries and other oil-production sites controlled by the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL.""We intend to shut it all down,"" Col. Steven H. Warren, a military spokesman in Baghdad, said in an email on Thursday.More broadly, the intensified targeting of one of the militant group's major financing sources is part of the Obama administration's effort to accelerate the pace of the anti-Islamic State campaign. The campaign against the militant group also includes helping Kurdish fighters retake the Iraqi border town of Sinjar, and sending some 50 Special Operations troops to assist opposition fighters in eastern Syria as well as the air campaign.Lt. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the head of that campaign, headquartered in Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, said in an interview last week that allied warplanes are intensifying attacks on a series of fixed sites such as oil-production facilities, bomb-making factories and other so-called critical nodes that support the Islamic State's war effort.The revamped plan for attacking the oil-production sites comes after weeks of intense study of eight major fields -- Omar, Tanak, El Isbah, Sijan, Jafra, Azraq, Barghooth and Abu Hardan -- to determine how to inflict more financial pain on the Islamic State, American officials said.Instead of putting the group's oil-production capability out of action for days, the new goal is to knock out specific installations for six months to a year, the officials said. This involves targeting fuel oil separators and elements of pumping stations at sites in Islamic State-controlled areas of Deir el-Zour, a city on the Euphrates River near the eastern border with Iraq.At the same time, the United States shifted some of its surveillance and reconnaissance planes from bases in the Persian Gulf to Incirlik air base in Turkey, a much shorter flight to Syria to allow planes to spend more time lingering over their targets.The new operation is called Tidal Wave II, named after Operation Tidal Wave, the World War II campaign to hit Romania's oil industry and thus hurt Nazi Germany. Lt. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who in September became the commander of the international coalition's effort in Iraq and Syria, came up with the name.Much of the initial targeting was done in South Carolina at Shaw Air Force Base, which has become a leading symbol of the military's ability to carry out global operations from afar.One of the main objectives for the scores of analysts and planners at the air base has been to attack its ability to produce and sell oil.In the air campaign's first three months, for instance, allied warplanes damaged or destroyed more than two dozen smaller mobile refineries and about twice as many collection points where drivers dump their crude oil to be hauled to refineries.Now that targeting is being intensified. ""The art we had of building target sets and doing deep studies on adversaries, in some cases was a lost art,"" General Brown said. ""What targets are we not striking that we could go strike? How do we bring all the intelligence together?""On the Oct. 21 mission, American aircraft struck Islamic State-controlled oil refineries, command and control centers, and transportation infrastructure in the Omar oil field, which produced about 30,000 barrels a day when it was fully functioning. More recently, the field produced about a third of that or less, analysts said.""It was very specific targets that would result in long-term incapacitation of their ability to sell oil, to get it out of the ground and transport it,"" Maj. Michael Filanowski, a military operations officer, told reporters in Baghdad after the strike.The French defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said on Tuesday that his nation's warplanes had attacked more oil targets in the same region.It was France's fourth wave of strikes in Syria since President François Hollande decided in September to join the campaign there against the Islamic State, and the second in as many days.American commanders cautioned that it may take some time to gauge the impact of the new targeting, given the financial reserves the militant group has built up.Unlike measuring the immediate impact of bombing tanks or soldiers, ""it might be longer to feel the effect of oil fields,"" General Brown said.",1.0
"Damascus Accuses U.S. Coalition of Bombing Base, but Americans Point to the Russians:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Syria on Monday said a United States-led coalition had bombed a Syrian military base in the east of the country, killing three soldiers, wounding at least 13 and destroying vehicles and equipment. The United States denied the Syrian accusation and said a Russian warplane appeared to have been responsible.The Syrian accusation, in a statement carried by the official news agency, was the first time that President Bashar al-Assad's government had held the Americans responsible for bombing a Syrian military facility since the United States began airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria more than a year ago.The statement said that the bombing had been conducted Sunday evening in Deir al-Zour Province, and that Syria had sent letters of protest to the United Nations calling it ""a heinous aggression by the coalition.""American military officials said the coalition had carried out airstrikes in the province on Sunday, but they said no Syrian military positions had been struck. The Americans seemed anxious to avoid an escalation of tensions with Mr. Assad's government.A statement from the United States-led Combined Joint Task Force said that the coalition had conducted four airstrikes on Sunday, ""all against oil well heads,"" about 35 miles from the base. ""We did not strike any vehicles or personnel targets in this area,"" the statement said. ""We have no indication any Syrian soldiers were even near our strikes.""A senior United States official later attributed any deaths and any damage to the Syrian base to what he called ""a screw-up"" by the Russians, who joined the Syria war in September as allies of Mr. Assad and have conducted airstrikes with Backfire bombers and other aerial armaments.""We've got a radar track showing a Backfire bomber flying directly over the town that the Syrians named a few minutes before the first claims that we killed some Syrian troops,"" the American official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational details.Russian officials had no immediate comment on either the Syrian government's accusations against the American-led coalition or the American response implicating the Russians. But Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, reiterated what he called the need for a combined effort to vanquish extremist militants in Syria.""Both President Putin and Russian officials at various levels repeatedly emphasized our belief that an effective counteraction against these dangerous developments is only possible on the platform of a united coalition and an absolute coordination of any joint efforts,"" Mr. Peskov said in comments reported by Russia's Interfax news agency.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an independent monitoring group that tracks the conflict from Britain through a network of contacts on the ground, also reported on Monday that American coalition airstrikes had apparently hit a Syrian military post on Sunday near Ayyash, in the western part of Deir al-Zour.The United States has recently escalated its attacks in the province, with the stated aim of disrupting large oil fields controlled by the Islamic State, an important source of the group's revenue. In addition to the United States, Britain and France have recently started conducting airstrikes in Syria against the Islamic State.",1.0

The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, said the attack was the first United States strike against an Islamic State leader in Libya and predicted last month that it would degrade the group's ability to recruit members and establish bases in Libya.",1.0
Influx of Turkish Troops Angers Iraqi Officials:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Turkey has sent more troops, along with armored vehicles and tanks, to northern Iraq to support a longstanding mission to train Kurdish and Sunni Arab forces in the fight against the Islamic State, touching off an uproar in Baghdad, where officials called the move a violation of Iraqi sovereignty.The troop movements on the outskirts of Mosul apparently came in recent days and were done in coordination with the autonomous Kurdish government in northern Iraq, but not with the central government in Baghdad. They prompted the Iraqi foreign ministry to summon the Turkish ambassador in protest on Saturday and demand that the forces withdraw from Iraq.In a statement, the foreign ministry called the Turkish troop movements a hostile act and said they had been made ""without the knowledge of the Iraqi central government,"" adding, ""This is considered a violation and a breach of the sovereignty of the country."" Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and President Fuad Masum also voiced objections.Days earlier, Mr. Abadi, who came to power last year with the strong support of the United States, made a similarly tough statement in reaction to the United States' plans to deploy Special Operations forces to Iraq to conduct raids against Islamic State targets. He wrote on Facebook, ""Iraq doesn't need foreign ground troops,"" and added, ""This will be considered an act of aggression.""The reactions of the Iraqi authorities to the growing military role of the United States and Turkey inside Iraq highlighted Mr. Abadi's weakness as he seeks to balance his relationships with the West and Iran, which backs powerful militias in Iraq. Some of the leaders of those militias are popular on the Iraqi street and have sought to undermine Mr. Abadi, saying they will fight any foreign troops on Iraqi soil.In an interview on Saturday, Hakim al-Zamili, the head of Parliament's security committee and a Shiite militia leader, said the Iraqi military, if necessary, should strike the Turkish positions in the north.""I have sent a letter to Abadi and told him that Iraqi sovereignty must be respected, and we have weapons and F-16 planes and must use them to hit the Turkish military force in Mosul, so no one will dare violate the sovereignty of Iraq,"" he said.While a military confrontation seems unlikely, the controversy highlights the extent to which Iraq is divided, essentially split between areas controlled by the Islamic State, the northern Kurdish region, and a Shiite-dominated zone that includes Baghdad and the south and that represents the extent of the central government's control.For instance, Turkey has established its small military presence in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq without the approval of Baghdad. For nearly a year, it has trained a small group of largely Sunni Arab fighters. They are mostly former policemen from Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, which fell to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, last year.Turkish officials played down the new troop deployment, saying it was a routine move to support a continuing training mission in the north.""No one should interpret our help in a wrong way,"" Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey said Saturday, in remarks reported by the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency. ""Turkey does not have an eye on another country's soil, and she would never have. Turkey's struggle is against terror and terror organizations."" The news agency said 150 new troops had been deployed.Baghdad has been aware of Turkey's presence but chose to publicly challenge it only now -- underscoring, analysts say, the increasing pressure Mr. Abadi is facing from Iran and its proxies, including Iraq's former prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. In a report published last month, Ayham Kamel, the director for the Middle East and North Africa at the political risk firm Eurasia Group, predicted that Mr. Abadi would likely be ousted sometime next year.In the case of the United States, American officials say they negotiated with Mr. Abadi about the new deployments of Special Forces and believe his recent comments in defense of Iraqi sovereignty were made for domestic political reasons.Still, Mr. Abadi's increasingly weak position in the face of Iranian pressure complicates matters for the United States as it considers increasing its military presence in Iraq to fight the Islamic State.While the deal reached by the West and Iran to curb Iran's nuclear program raised hopes that Washington and Tehran could more closely coordinate campaigns against the Islamic State in Iraq, that now appears unlikely. The heads of powerful Iranian-backed militias have said they are willing to fight any new American troops in Iraq, as they did during the long American occupation after 2003.Rather than the United States' and Iran's becoming partners in the fight against the Islamic State, Iran's presence in Iraq is seen as a constraint on the American military's role there.Kirk H. Sowell, an analyst based in Amman, Jordan, and editor of the newsletter Inside Iraqi Politics, wrote in an email, ""The sending of ground forces to Iraq in any appreciable numbers would almost certainly open a new front in the war, with U.S. troops fighting Shia militias instead of Islamic State.""",1.0
Middle East; Yemen: Saudis to Investigate Clinic Raid:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- A military coalition led by Saudi Arabia said Friday that it would form a ""fact-finding committee"" to investigate allegations that coalition warplanes had bombed a clinic in Yemen operated by Doctors Without Borders earlier in the week, injuring nine people, according to a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.Doctors Without Borders said Thursday that it had repeatedly provided the coalition with the clinic's coordinates before the airstrikes, which occurred on Wednesday morning.The coalition has been fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen since March and controls the airspace over the country. The strikes on Wednesday were the second coalition attack on a Doctors Without Borders medical site in Yemen in less than two months.In a separate statement, Saudi Arabia urged aid agencies to coordinate movements with the coalition and to ""remain away from the places where the Houthi militias are present.""",1.0
"Iran Sent Arms to Iraq to Fight ISIS, U.S. Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"WASHINGTON -- Iran has deployed advanced rockets and missiles to Iraq to help fight the Islamic State in Tikrit, a significant escalation of firepower and another sign of Iran's growing influence in Iraq.United States intelligence agencies detected the deployments in the past few weeks as Iraq was marshaling a force of 30,000 troops -- two-thirds of them Shiite militias largely trained and equipped by Iran, according to three American officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence reports on Iran.Iran has not yet launched any of the weapons, but American officials fear the rockets and missiles could further inflame sectarian tensions and cause civilian casualties because they are not precision guided. Their deployment is another dilemma for the Obama administration as it trains and equips the Iraqi military and security services to help defeat the Islamic State, but unlike Iran is unwilling to commit fighters and advisers who join Iraqi forces in the field.One senior American military official who tracks classified intelligence reports said Iran had deployed Fajr-5 artillery rockets and Fateh-110 missiles and their launchers. Another senior American military official who also monitors sensitive government reports on Iran said the deployed weapons were similar to the Fajr-5 rockets and Fateh-110 missiles but were slightly different and had different names. The official offered no other details. The C.I.A. declined to comment.Either way, American officials agreed that the Iranian missiles introduced a new level of advanced weaponry to the battlefield in Iraq, even as some experts questioned their usefulness at this stage in the battle for Tikrit. But the Fajr-5 rockets are the same weapons that Hamas has fired against Israel in recent conflicts. Hezbollah and the Syrian Army have also been using Iranian rockets and missiles for some time, military specialists said.The second senior American military official said the Iranian missiles are ""not a big deal at this point,"" but then quickly added, ""My concern, as with artillery and other non-precise weapons, is collateral damage if they employ them.""There has been growing international pressure to avoid civilian casualties and revenge attacks on people or property in an operation by a mostly Shiite force in a hub of the so-called Sunni triangle. Appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 3, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, alluded to the deployment of the rockets and missiles when he said, ""This is the most overt conduct of Iranian support, in the form of artillery and other things.""General Dempsey also said that while the involvement of Iranian-backed Shiites in Tikrit could be ""a positive thing,"" he voiced concerns that ""it will only be a problem if it results in sectarianism.""That sentiment underscored the reality that even though American officials have deep reservations about Iran's enduring role in Iraq, Iraqis need Iranian help in defeating the Islamic State.""Are you concerned that Iran has basically taken over the fight?"" Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who heads the Armed Services Committee, asked Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter at the same March 3 hearing.""Sectarianism is what brought us to the point where we are,"" Mr. Carter replied. ""And so I do look at it with concern. We're watching it very closely.""American officials say they believe Iran imported the rockets and missiles for the Tikrit operation because other artillery was not able to reach targets around the city in what has become a difficult, protracted battle. Even after weeks of fighting, Islamic State militants remained dug in on Monday in Tikrit and still controlled parts of the city against the much larger pro-government force.And in a sign of how much this battle reflected the entire campaign against ISIS, Iraqi officials said they were pausing their offensive to summon reinforcements and to preserve property and civilian lives.The Fajr-5 rocket and Fateh-110 missile launching systems are typically carried on a specially designed truck and are formidable additions to the Iraqi arsenal. Fajr-5 rockets, which are named after the Persian word for dawn, have a range of about 45 miles. Each is 20 feet long and weighs more than 2,000 pounds. The Fajr-5 warhead alone weighs 375 pounds.It is unclear how many rockets and missiles the Iranians brought with launchers or how they would resupply their stockpile should the trained Iranian crews employ them, said one senior American military official.The Fateh-110 missile is even more capable than the Fajr-5, military specialists said on Monday, but they questioned the need for them in Tikrit now that the battle has moved to close-quarters, urban combat, when unguided rockets and missiles are not as useful. ""Generally speaking, these weapons are more effective at terrorizing civilians than providing fire support for ground operations,"" said Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation analyst at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. ""That is how Hezbollah has used them. I don't expect that either system will produce dramatically different results on the battlefield.""Military specialists speculated that Iranians might have brought the weapons into Iraq with the idea that they would use them if they could not effectively advance on Tikrit, and now may be keeping them there with the expectation of using them in a future battle, perhaps for the city of Mosul.Over all, the military specialists said it was not particularly surprising to see the Iranians deploying the advanced rockets and missiles to the fight in Iraq.These officials said that the deployment builds on a pattern of assistance that Iran and its proxies have provided Iraq since 2004, and most recently accelerated in an effort to blunt the Islamic State's momentum. Even as American warplanes provided cover, Iranian-trained Shiite militias last August broke a weeklong ISIS siege of Amerli, a group of farming villages whose Shiite residents faced possible annihilation.Last summer, when Islamic State militants first captured Mosul and got within striking distance of Erbil, the Kurdish capital, the head of Iran's Quds Force and its chief spymaster, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, flew to Erbil with two planes full of military supplies, American and regional diplomats said. The Iranian move helped to bolster Kurdish defenses around Erbil.In the Tikrit operation, General Suleimani was close at hand to help oversee the offensive led by Iranian-backed Shiite militia leaders that make up more than two-thirds of the pro-government force.His leadership did not go unnoticed in Washington. ""We are watching,"" General Dempsey said.Photograph United States Intelligence Officials Say That Fateh-110 Missiles, Like This One Displayed in 2010 in Tehran, Were Sent to Iraq.

Putin Says He Weighed Nuclear Alert Over Crimea:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- After the revolution in Ukraine last year, President Vladimir V. Putin sent military forces to secure Crimea and even weighed putting Russia's nuclear arsenal on alert because of his concerns about both anarchy and Western intervention, the Russian leader said in a documentary broadcast Sunday.The documentary, called ""Homeward Bound,"" was produced by the state-run Rossiya 1 channel to celebrate the anniversary of the March 21, 2014, annexation of Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that was given to Ukraine in 1954 when both were a part of the Soviet Union.The film presented the events as a triumph of security planning and execution, with Mr. Putin at its heart. Throughout the documentary, which ran for two and a half hours, Mr. Putin tried both to justify the move -- which most Western nations considered outside international law and led to economic sanctions that have magnified Russia's current, oil-related recession -- and to boast about it.""The overall tone is upbeat: Russia's greatness and fulsomeness being restored,"" wrote Dmitri V. Trenin, the head of the Carnegie Moscow Center, in response to a question via email. ""With respect to the U.S./West: keep away from this, it's our people, our historical land, our stakes are so much higher than yours, we will always outbid you if necessary.""The documentary appeared as a mood of unease gripped Moscow, not least because Mr. Putin has not been seen in public since March 5. His sudden withdrawal followed the Feb. 27 assassination of an opposition leader near the Kremlin, a killing that some analysts have suggested was rooted in a rivalry between different branches of the security services.Mr. Putin is scheduled to reappear in public on Monday, when he is supposed to meet the president of Kyrgyzstan in St. Petersburg.The takeover of Crimea, the site of an important Russian naval base, proved wildly popular with Russians, who always considered it a part of the motherland. In the aftermath, Mr. Putin's approval rating rose as high as 88 percent, even though the annexation and subsequent Russian support for separatists in Ukraine brought Moscow's relations with the West to their lowest point since the Cold War.""I was speaking with colleagues and said, 'Frankly, this is our historical territory and Russian people live there, they were in danger, and we cannot abandon them,' "" he said in the documentary.Before now, Mr. Putin had emphasized that he had felt compelled to act after the overwhelming majority of Crimeans approved a referendum on joining Russia.That element remains, but in the latest version Mr. Putin puts a much greater stress on the abrupt manner in which President Viktor F. Yanukovych of Ukraine was overthrown and on his own concerns about a potential Western military reaction.""We never thought about severing Crimea from Ukraine until the moment that these events began, the government overthrow,"" he said.Russia has never accepted the idea that Mr. Yanukovych was toppled by a popular revolution, instead saying that Europe and particularly the United States engineered the crowds that camped out in Kiev's Maidan square for months and eventually brought down the government on Feb. 21, 2014. ""The real puppeteers were our American partners and friends,"" Mr. Putin said.Mr. Putin said that he told his security chiefs at dawn on Feb. 23, after an all-night meeting, that it was time to start planning for the return of Crimea to Russia. He also said that concerns that the West might intervene militarily prompted him to consider putting Russia's nuclear weapons on alert. He was ready to face ""the worst possible turn of events,"" he said, but ultimately decided it was unnecessary.During the Soviet period, when Russia was considered a superpower, its nuclear arsenal was rarely if ever mentioned. More recently, as the West has categorized Russia as weak and not that important, the government and the state-run news media have repeatedly made not-so-subtle mention of the country's nuclear abilities.Mr. Putin said he sent thousands of troops, particularly the special forces, to secure Crimea and to ensure that some 20,000 Ukrainian soldiers there did not try to control it. ""We monitored the situation and had to bring in our equipment,"" Mr. Putin said. ""They would have been wiped out after the first salvo.""",1.0
Leading Role for France as Africa Battles Back:   [Foreign Desk ],,"NDJAMENA, Chad -- Deep in the Sahara, late at night, a Reaper drone silently tracked a six-vehicle convoy crossing the desert into Niger from Libya. Minutes later, French attack planes and helicopter gunships swooped down on the convoy of Qaeda-backed fighters, turning the militant caravan into smoldering wreckage.The raid last October by French combat aircraft and commandos killed or captured 15 Islamist fighters, and recovered nearly three tons of weapons, including Russian-designed SA-7 shoulder-fired missiles and several hundred anti-tank rockets, all bound for guerrilla operations in Mali, French officials said.The attack also provided a view of an increasingly violent, multifront campaign that France has joined here in the Sahel, a vast area on the southern flank of the Sahara that stretches from Senegal to Chad. The battle is being waged to combat Al Qaeda's affiliate in North Africa and other Islamist extremists in Mali, and more recently to thwart Boko Haram, a violent militancy that is spilling across from Nigeria to attack Chad, Niger and Cameroon.Last summer, France reorganized its 3,000-member force in West Africa to carry out its counterterrorism fight more effectively in some of the harshest terrain on the planet.The French military has concentrated its air power and mission headquarters here in Chad, its reconnaissance drones in Niger, its special operations troops in Burkina Faso, and its logistics hub in Ivory Coast. It has also deployed about 1,200 soldiers to Gao and another site in northern Mali to fight the remnants of militant organizations that French-led forces rolled back in early 2013.""The fight against terrorist groups is our daily business,"" said Gen. Jean-Pierre Palasset, the commander of the operation, called Barkhane, which means sand dune in French. General Palasset also led French troops in Afghanistan and the Ivory Coast.The mission is expanding to support regional African forces fighting Boko Haram, France's defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said last week. That will likely mean more operations like the one last month in which a French team in the city of Diffa, in southeastern Niger just across from Nigeria, collected intelligence on Boko Haram.Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Benin, along with Nigeria, have agreed to contribute 8,700 troops to a regional force to contain and, it is hoped, defeat Boko Haram after the group seized territory the size of Belgium in northeastern Nigeria and then staged cross-border attacks. African troops have since regained some towns.""The question is not about numbers but how we provide support in terms of planning, logistics and intelligence to our African allies,"" said a senior French Defense Ministry official in Paris. ""It could be 100 or 200 additional officers. We need to support the Cameroonians, the Chadians. We don't intend to be ahead of them; we need to be there to help them.""French officials have paid close attention to fast-shifting developments in the region. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, held meetings in Chad, Cameroon and Niger last month to discuss security threats.In January, Mr. Le Drian visited Madama, a new forward-operating base in northern Niger, 60 miles from the Libyan border. With more than 200 troops and combat helicopters based there, the outpost is designed to stanch the flow of foreign fighters, terrorists and criminal smugglers coursing down from the mayhem in largely ungoverned southern Libya into sparsely populated and lightly defended Niger and Mali.France, which has the United Nations Security Council presidency in March, is also pushing for a resolution by early April that would back the regional African force to fight Boko Haram, providing it with crucial financing to carry out operations.The Obama administration, which is already fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has been only too eager to provide financial, logistical and intelligence support to France to avoid having to put American combat forces on the ground in yet another global hot spot.""There's a lot of merit to partnering with the French who have sort of staked out their claim in the Sahel region of North Africa,"" James R. Clapper Jr., the American director of national intelligence, told a Senate committee last month. ""They have history and heritage there, access, and have committed to deploying troops in that area, boots on the ground, which we can supplement.""Last August, President Obama authorized the Pentagon to send France $10 million to help pay for troop transport and aerial refueling.""There's already an unprecedented degree of coordination, with both the U.S. and France bringing complementary strengths to the table,"" said Michael R. Shurkin, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst who is now at the RAND Corporation. ""The more the U.S. and France work together, the greater the regional alliance's chance of success.""That regional cooperation began in earnest in January 2013 when French forces led a military operation that largely expelled Qaeda-linked extremists from a vast area they had controlled in northeastern Mali.Since last August, personnel assigned to the French counterterrorism operations, working with African security forces, have killed or captured about 100 militants, French officials said. French attack planes have carried out several strikes in just the past few months in northern Mali.Last December, French troops working with Malian authorities near Gao killed Ahmed al-Tilemsi, who had a $5 million bounty on his head after the State Department listed him as a ""specially designated global terrorist.""Mr. Tilemsi, a Mali native, was a leader of Al Mourabitoun, a group formed by extremists who split off from the Qaeda affiliate here two years ago. The extremists led an attack on the In Amenas gas plant in Algeria in 2013 and killed at least 37 foreign hostages taken during the assault.More recently, French forces joined 800 troops from Mauritania and Mali in a show-of-force mission west of Timbuktu near the Mauritanian border.In addition to the threat from Boko Haram, French officials have voiced increasing concern about members of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, and other extremists using southwestern Libya as a safe haven and as a logistic base mainly for fuel and ammunition.It is an area that is also commanding increasing concern in Washington, and drawing the two countries closer. ""We have absolutely overlapping interests here,"" James Knight, the United States ambassador to Chad, said in an interview here. ""The cooperation is seamless.""",1.0
"Poles Steel for Battle, Fearing Russia Will March on Them Next:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"KALISZ, Poland -- For evidence of how much President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has jangled nerves and provoked anxiety across Eastern Europe, look no farther than the drill held the other day by the Shooters Association.The paramilitary group, like more than 100 others in Poland, has experienced a sharp spike in membership since Mr. Putin's forces began meddling in neighboring Ukraine last year.Thirty students took an oath to defend Poland at all costs, joining nearly 200 other regional members of the association -- young men and women, boys and girls -- marching in formation around the perimeter of the dusty high school courtyard here. They crossed Polish Army Boulevard and marched into the center of town, sprawling in four long lines along the edge of St. Joseph's Square.Gen. Boguslaw Pacek, an adviser to the Polish defense minister and the government's chief liaison with these paramilitary groups, marched with them. He has been making the rounds in recent months of such gatherings: student chapters like this one, as well as groups of veterans, even battle re-enactors.One of those who took the oath in Kalisz was Bartosz Walesiak, 16, who said he had been interested in the military since playing with toy soldiers as a little boy, but had been motivated to join the Shooters Association after Russia moved into Crimea.""I think that Putin will want more,"" he said.""Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia are already getting ready for such a scenario, so Poland must do the same.""As the crisis drags on, what was unthinkable at the end of the Cold War now seems not quite so unlikely to many Poles: that the great Russian behemoth will not be sated with Ukraine and will reach out once again into the West. The thought is darkening the national mood and rippling across the entire region in ways that reflect a visceral fear of an aggressive and unpredictable Russia.Pointing out that Russia insists it has no such intentions usually elicits little more than a despairing laugh.""I think the impact on everyday life is starting to be very bad,"" said Marcin Zaborowski, director of the Polish Institute of International Affairs. ""Very often now, people approach me -- neighbors, hairdressers -- asking whether there will be a war. The other day, my mother called and asked me.""Dinner parties in Warsaw these days frequently drift to the topic. Possibilities that were once shrugged off are now seriously contemplated. Even the jokes are laced with anxiety.In January, the Polish Ministry of National Defense announced that it would provide military training to any civilian who wished to receive it, with registration beginning March 1. About 1,000 people showed up the first day, said Col. Tomasz Szulejko, spokesman for the Polish Army's general staff. ""This number certainly bodes well for the future,"" he said.Tomasz Siemoniak, Poland's defense minister, is also contemplating a proposal to establish a Territorial Defense Force, taking the cream of the members of the paramilitary associations and other volunteers to create something akin to the National Guard in the United States.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz changed the law on who can be called up for service in case of ""military maneuvers."" Previously, the armed forces could summon only current and former reservists, those with actual military training. Now, if necessary, they can call on almost any man in the country.In neighboring Lithuania, President Dalia Grybauskaite said her government intended to reinstate military conscription because of the ""current geopolitical environment.""In January, the government issued a 98-page booklet (""How to Act in Extreme Situations or Instances of War"") that offered advice on what citizens should do if foreign soldiers appeared on their doorstep, and how they might offer passive resistance to an occupying power.""If you are a civilian and you make that clear, it is unlikely someone will rush to kill you,"" the booklet advised, urging people not to panic. Even hearing shots fired outside your home ""is not the end of the world,"" it said.""People come up and ask me: 'Should we leave? Should we flee?' "" said Karlis Bukovskis, deputy director of the Latvian Institute of International Affairs in Riga. ""This is a new development. This is the first time that has happened to me.""Worries are increasing in Poland, but they have not yet reached the level of mass fear, said Tomasz Szlendak, a sociologist at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun who has studied the effects the Ukraine crisis is having in Poland.At a recent party of fellow academics, he said, one retired military officer announced that he would organize a local militia if the Russians invaded. Another professor declared that he would put his wife and daughter on a plane out of Poland with a bag of money and then sign up with one of the paramilitary groups.""These kind of comments are, of course, meant as jokes,"" Mr. Szlendak said. ""But they are based on real fear. They are humorless, sad jokes.""The situation has not quite gotten to the point that people are stockpiling food and ammunition in the basement, said Mr. Zaborowski of the Polish Institute of International Affairs, but anxiety is definitely rising.Pawel Kowal, a former member of Poland's Parliament and a foreign policy expert, said the country was getting parallel messages from its leaders, being told that a newly aggressive Russia poses a genuine threat while also being reassured that membership in NATO and the European Union will provide sufficient protection.""The sense is that the border between NATO and Russia is like a new Iron Curtain,"" Mr. Kowal said. ""But at least this time, Poland is on the right side of it.""The growing enrollment in the paramilitary groups is just one manifestation of the changed climate. The number of groups, General Pacek said, is clearly rising. Not all of the increase is due to Ukraine -- patriotism and uniformed service are becoming more fashionable among younger Poles, and the military does offer a stable career -- but Mr. Putin's shadow has certainly accelerated the trend, he said.A gathering a few days earlier in the city of Szczecin had 500 new cadets taking the oath. General Pacek estimated there were 120 such groups at the moment, with about 80,000 members, but he acknowledged that this was just a guess, as the groups are not required to report their existence or membership rolls.The Defense Ministry has been trying to entice the groups to join an alliance with the government, offering equipment, uniforms, training and even money in exchange for a clearer idea of who they are -- and a chance to assemble a new generation of energized recruits.""There is no question of them doing any fighting,"" General Pacek said. ""They are to offer assistance to the military. But of course, they have to be prepared to defend.""In St. Joseph's Square, the 30 new members of the Shooting Association waited for the command before taking four purposeful steps forward and raising their right hands.""I hereby pledge to put the good of the Polish Republic above all else,"" they repeated. ""I will always be ready to defend its independence until my last breath.""After the ceremony, Grzegorz Sapinski, the mayor of Kalisz, watched the cadets march down the cobblestone streets back to the school.""One cannot help but notice the change in attitudes among young people following what is happening in Ukraine,"" Mr. Sapinski said. ""The conflict is not in some obscure place. It is happening four hours' drive away.""The members of one squad from the Shooters Association were splayed on their bellies on the edge of the school's soccer field, pushing themselves ahead one knee thrust at a time. Each held a prop AK-47, and Capt. Lukasz Kolcz, the chapter's commander, barked at them to keep low and move forward.The youngest of the cadets, Grzegorz Zurek, 11, was having trouble keeping up, but he was stubbornly determined. As they arrived on the far side of the field, the cadets turned to cheer Grzegorz along.""I think it is highly probable that Putin will do something against Poland,"" Grzegorz later said. ""I know from history that Russia has always been a totalitarian state. Now it is trying to regain the territory it lost at the end of the Cold War.""He rested his rubber-coated gun on the soft, perfect grass.""Should it invade Poland,"" he said, ""I would not hesitate a second to fight against them.""Photograph Members of One of Poland's More Than 100 Paramilitary Groups Trained in Kalisz This Month.

Chinese General Warns Myanmar:   [Foreign Desk ],,"HONG KONG -- Tensions between China and Myanmar deepened on Saturday when a Chinese military commander warned of a strong response unless Myanmar prevented warfare with ethnic rebel groups from spilling into Chinese territory.The commander, Gen. Fan Changlong, a vice chairman of China's Central Military Commission, issued the warning after four Chinese farmers died on Friday when a military plane from Myanmar dropped a bomb in China near the two countries' border, Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, reported. Myanmar's forces have been fighting rebel forces in Kokang, an ethnic Chinese enclave next to the Chinese border.""The top echelons in the Myanmar military must strictly control and restrain their forces, and there can be absolutely no repeat of such incidents,"" General Fan told the commander in chief of Myanmar's military, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, in a telephone call, Xinhua said. ""Otherwise, the Chinese military will take resolute and decisive measures to protect Chinese people's lives and property.""General Fan repeated the Chinese government's demand for a thorough inquiry by Myanmar of the bombing, and harsh punishment for those found responsible.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; China: Deadly Intrusion Is Denounced:   [Foreign Desk ],,"HONG KONG -- Four farmers in southwest China were killed Friday when one or more bombs released from a warplane from Myanmar struck a sugar cane field, as fighting between Myanmar's government forces and an ethnic group pressed against the frontier with China.The deaths, reported by Chinese state-run television, appeared to be the worst instance so far of the recently renewed conflict between Myanmar's army and armed supporters of the Kokang people, an ethnic Chinese minority, rippling into neighboring Yunnan Province in China. Another nine people were wounded by the bombing, said Xinhua, the main Chinese state news agency.Late on Friday, a Chinese vice minister for foreign affairs, Liu Zhenmin, summoned Myanmar's ambassador in Beijing, U Thit Linn Ohn, to denounce the deaths and the intrusion into Chinese territory, Xinhua reported. The reports did not say whether the Chinese government thought the intrusion was deliberate or accidental.""We urge the Myanmar side to thoroughly investigate this incident and report the findings to the Chinese side, and to sternly punish the perpetrator,"" Mr. Liu told the ambassador, according to Xinhua.""Immediately take effective steps to prevent incidents like this from recurring, and thoroughly safeguard the security and stability of the China-Myanmar border region,"" Mr. Liu said.The Xinhua report in English indicated that Myanmar's plane dropped one bomb. But the Global Times, a popular Chinese newspaper that has often reported on the conflict, initially said the cane field was struck three times.The deaths threaten to complicate China's position in responding to fighting between Myanmar government forces and armed supporters of the Kokang, who call themselves the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army. The conflict flared in February, prompting tens of thousands of residents of the region, which is also known as Kokang, to flee into Yunnan. The last big eruption of fighting in the Kokang area was in 2009.The Kokang people have deep cultural, commercial and often personal ties with China, and are often barely distinguishable from inhabitants of Yunnan Province. In the eyes of Chinese sympathizers, they are a beleaguered minority deserving Beijing's support, and the hardships of Kokang refugees have been reported by the Chinese media, drawing an outpouring of supportive comments online.But Beijing has sought to shore up its increasingly brittle relations with the Myanmar government, and has insisted that it abides by a principle of not meddling in other countries' domestic problems. The government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, has accused rebels of staging attacks from Chinese territory, a claim denied by Beijing and Kokang leaders.At a news conference in Beijing on Sunday, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, said China was closely watching the fighting between Myanmar's forces and the Kokang fighters.""We are friendly neighbors, sharing not just mountains and rivers, but also weal and woe,"" Mr. Wang said, according to Xinhua. ""When problems arise in our neighbor's house, we follow the situation very closely.""The Chinese Air Force set up teams of fighter jets a number of times Friday to tail and warn Myanmar military planes and force them out of Chinese airspace, the state-run China News Service quoted an air force spokesman as saying Saturday. The air force will step up operations along the border with Myanmar, said the spokesman, Shen Jinke.The two countries share a 1,367 mile-long border, and other conflicts between the Myanmar government and armed ethnic groups on the fractious frontier have also spilled over. In 2013, reports said three people died in a Chinese border town from shelling when Myanmar's army was fighting the Kachin Independence Army.The Global Times said Myanmar Air Force planes had entered Chinese airspace at least four times in the current fighting. This week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that on Sunday a house on Chinese soil was flattened by a stray shell from the fighting.The bomb from Myanmar's warplane hit the sugar cane field in Gema County on Friday afternoon, China Central Television news said. The Global Times showed pictures on its website, which it said showed the aftermath: distraught villagers standing over covered bodies, and wooden burial coffins readied for the dead.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
U.S. Targets Shabab Unit in Somalia:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The United States has carried out airstrikes against a senior member of the Shabab extremist group who is believed to have helped plan the 2013 attack on the Westgate mall in Kenya, American officials said Friday.Pentagon officials said they were still assessing the results of a drone strike, carried out Thursday against the senior member, Adan Garar, and two other militants near a Somali town west of Mogadishu, not far from the border with Kenya. It was unclear whether Mr. Garar and his associates had been killed, they said.""U.S. military forces conducted a counterterrorism operation in Somalia yesterday, March 12, against the Al Shabab network,"" said Col. Steve Warren, a Defense Department spokesman. ""We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate.""For nearly a decade, the United States has been trying to fight the Shabab through economic sanctions, missile strikes and commando raids. Last year, the Obama administration stepped up its efforts, and in September an American drone strike killed the leader of the Shabab, Ahmed Abdi Godane, one of the most wanted men in Africa.At the time, President Obama drew a direct link between the killing of Mr. Godane, who turned an obscure Somali militant group into one of the most fearsome franchises of Al Qaeda in the world, and American plans for the leaders of the Islamic State in Iraq. The Pentagon press secretary at the time, Rear Adm. John F. Kirby, called the death of Mr. Godane ""a major symbolic and operational loss"" to the Shabab.But if the Shabab suffered a major setback with the killing of Mr. Godane, the group's remaining leaders have vowed to attack in Kenya, Uganda and Somalia.The siege on the upscale Westgate mall in Nairobi, where dozens were killed, heightened American concerns that the Shabab's desire to inflict casualties extended beyond Somalia.Defense officials cautioned that they did not know yet if the drone strikes were successful in killing Mr. Garar or any other Shabab leaders. In the Godane case last year, it took several days of monitoring cellphone traffic, questioning Somali officials on the ground and poring over reports from both American and British intelligence agencies before the death was confirmed.But Ben Mulwa, 34, who was wounded in the attack on the Westgate mall, said he hoped the claims were true.""We've been looking to see that justice be done,"" he said.Mr. Mulwa, who is now a coordinator for the Terror Victims Support Initiative, a grassroots group that lobbies for support and compensation for victims of terrorism in Kenya, said the Shabab were continuing to make threats. ""This assures us that something is being done,"" he said.Mwenda Mbijiwe, a counterterrorism analyst in Kenya, said he believed that the small and tight-knit nature of the Shabab's top leadership meant that the group would ""be affected in a big way"" with the loss of Mr. Garar even if it continued to carry out attacks.On Friday, the Shabab claimed responsibility for an attack on a governor's convoy in northern Kenya near the border with Somalia that claimed the lives of three people.""Those who take over may take a more extreme approach, to say, 'We are still here,' "" Mr. Mbijiwe said.",1.0
Europe; Ukraine: Villagers Say They Saw Missile Just Before Civilian Jet Was Shot Down:   [Brief ],,"Villagers in eastern Ukraine have said they saw a missile flying directly overhead just before a Malaysian airliner was shot down last July, providing the most detailed accounts to date that suggest that the missile was fired from territory held by pro-Russian rebels. The accounts given to Reuters by four residents of Chervonyi Zhovten, which was then, and is now, controlled by the rebels, indicate that they saw the missile in the early stages of its flight path. That would mean it must have been launched from rebel ground nearby, challenging the claims of Moscow and the separatists that the plane was shot down by Ukraine's military. At the time, the nearest Ukrainian-held area was about 3.7 miles away. None of the villagers saw the missile being launched, but Ukraine and its Western allies have said the rebels shot down the airliner. All 298 people on board were killed. A Kremlin spokesman said a Dutch-led international investigation would determine what happened.",1.0
Putin Contradicts Claims on Annexation of Crimea:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has publicly indicated for the first time that the planning to reclaim Crimea from Ukraine started weeks before the Crimean referendum on the issue, which he had cited repeatedly as the main reason for Russia's annexation.Mr. Putin said he made the decision around 7 a.m. on Feb. 23, 2014, after an all-night emergency meeting with his security chiefs on the crisis in Ukraine. Viktor F. Yanukovych had just been deposed as the president of Ukraine, and the meeting was called to discuss his rescue, Mr. Putin said.Russia has long contended that it acted spontaneously to reclaim Crimea, mainly to protect Russian speakers who it said had been threatened, and to stave off what it suspected was an attempt by NATO to colonize the Black Sea.Mr. Putin in particular has emphasized the role of the March 16 referendum in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted to rejoin Russia.But in a clip shown late Sunday from a new documentary called ""Homeward Bound,"" produced by state-run Channel One television, Mr. Putin put a different emphasis on events.""I invited the leaders of our special services and the Defense Ministry to the Kremlin and gave them the task of saving the life of the Ukrainian president, who simply would have been liquidated,"" he said in an interview for the documentary, speaking about the night of Feb. 22.Mr. Yanukovych had fled Kiev for southeastern Ukraine, and he eventually made his way to Russia.""We finished about seven in the morning,"" Mr. Putin said. ""When we were parting, I told all my colleagues, 'We are obliged to begin working to bring Crimea back into Russia.' ""That one sentence appears to indicate that Mr. Putin made the decision more than three weeks before the referendum, but the clip from the documentary does not show any more of the interview. Channel One did not specify when the full documentary would be broadcast.Within days of the meeting at the Kremlin, unidentified soldiers began to overrun Crimea, raising the Russian flag over captured government buildings and expelling the Ukrainian military.At the time Mr. Putin denied Russia was involved, but he later admitted that the troops were in fact Russian special forces.The annexation proved wildly popular in Russia and has helped keep Mr. Putin's approval rating well above 80 percent for the year. His revelation about his decision comes as the annexation's first anniversary approaches.In remarks broadcast last year, Mr. Putin said the final decision was based on ""public sentiment."" He said the government first conducted secret opinion polls, which showed 80 percent of Crimea's population supported the annexation, and then the referendum results were even stronger.Speaking elsewhere last year, on a national call-in show, Mr. Putin said that he had delayed a decision while awaiting the referendum results.

Neighbors of Nigeria Take On Boko Haram:   [Foreign Desk ],,"DAKAR, Senegal -- Troops from Chad and Niger launched an offensive against Boko Haram militants in neighboring Nigeria, military officials from both countries said Monday, two days after the Islamist terrorist group killed scores in bombings in northeastern Nigeria.A military official in the Niger border city of Diffa confirmed Monday that two columns of military vehicles carrying soldiers from Niger and Chad had moved into Boko Haram's stronghold in Nigeria's Borno State on Sunday, consolidating control over two frontier towns, Damasak and Malam Fatori.Chad had previously reported that its forces had pushed Boko Haram out of the two towns in mid-February. But Monday was Niger's turn to do so. Chad's military spokesman hung up the phone when questioned about the discrepancy, though the spokesman, Col. Azem Bermandoa Agouna, did say that forces from the two neighboring countries were ""in coalition"" in the regional fight against Boko Haram.""The armed forces have launched themselves into the fight to recover the town,"" Colonel Azem said Monday from Ndjamena, the Chadian capital, referring to Damasak, a Boko Haram staging post for attacks.Control of the border towns has changed hands several times, and the situation in other remote towns in territory controlled by Boko Haram remains ambiguous. The Nigerian Army, which up until last month had conceded swaths of territory to the Islamist insurgents, is sensitive over the military assistance provided by its smaller neighbors.With a national election scheduled for March 28 and a pledge by military officials to stamp out Boko Haram before the vote, activity by Nigerian forces has intensified, as have efforts by the country's neighbors, who are worried about the effects of the insurgency on their economies. Boko Haram has increased cross-border raids into Cameroon, Chad and Niger in recent months.Facing direct engagement from government forces, Boko Haram has reverted to old tactics, bombing so-called soft targets in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri. Fifty to 100 people were killed in four bombings over the weekend at two crowded markets in the city.The attacks were grimly familiar, with women concealing explosives under their hijabs. In one attack on Saturday at Maiduguri's Monday Market, vigilantes forced a woman whom they suspected of carrying a bomb to the ground, only to be blown up as she detonated it. Nigerian reporters at another attack on Saturday at the Baga Fish Market noted that a number of the victims were children.",1.0
Refinery in Syria Is Target of Airstrike:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIRUT -- An American-led coalition airstrike in Syria hit an oil refinery run by Islamic State militants near the border with Turkey on Sunday, killing 30 people, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.Rami Abdul Rahman, director of the observatory, a monitoring group based in Britain, said the dead were refinery workers and militants. The targeted refinery was just northeast of the town of Tel Abyad near the Turkish border, he said.A spokesman for the United States Combined Joint Task Force overseeing the fight against the Islamic State said that when accusations of civilian casualties caused by the coalition are deemed credible, a thorough investigation begin.The Islamic State has seized wide areas of Syria and Iraq, including oil-producing regions that have financed its activities.In November, the United Nations estimated the Islamic State's revenue from oil at $846,000 to $1.6 million a day. However, the Pentagon says oil is no longer the group's main source of revenue. Western diplomats have said this was because of airstrikes on oil installations and a plunge in global oil prices.",1.0
"In a Test of Wills, Japanese Fighter Pilots Confront Chinese:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"NAHA, Japan -- Once a sleepy, sun-soaked backwater, this air base on the southern island of Okinawa has become the forefront of a dangerous test of wills between two of Asia's largest powers, Japan and China.At least once every day, Japanese F-15 fighter jets roar down the runway, scrambling to intercept foreign aircraft, mostly from China. The Japanese pilots say they usually face lumbering reconnaissance planes that cruise along the edge of Japanese-claimed airspace before turning home. But sometimes -- exactly how often is classified -- they face nimbler Chinese fighter jets in knuckle-whitening tests of piloting skills, and self-control.""Intercepting fighters is always more nerve-racking,"" said Lt. Col. Hiroyuki Uemura, squadron commander of the approximately 20 F-15 fighters stationed here at Naha Air Base. ""We hold our ground, but we don't provoke.""The high-velocity encounters over the East China Sea have made the skies above these strategic waters some of the tensest in the region, unnerving Pentagon planners concerned that a slip-up could cause a war with the potential to drag in the United States. Japan's refusal to back down over months of consistent challenges also represents a rare display of military spine by this long-dovish nation, and one that underscores just how far the rise of China and its forceful campaign to control nearby seas has pushed Japan out of its pacifist shell.Under its nationalistic prime minister, Shinzo Abe, Japan has embarked on the most sweeping overhaul of its defense posture in recent memory. Not only has Mr. Abe reversed a decade-long decline in military spending as part of what he calls ""proactive pacifism,"" but his government is also rewriting laws to lift restrictions on Japan's armed forces, which are already taking a more active role as far afield as the Gulf of Aden.It was, in fact, a speech by Mr. Abe that included tough statements on the Islamic State and an aid package to fight extremism that the militants cited as the reason they beheaded two Japanese hostages in January. Videos showing the men's bodies, posted online, gained Mr. Abe some traction for his notion that Japan must be more prepared to take on those who mean it harm.At the heart of Mr. Abe's strategy is a drive to create a more public profile for Japan's military, the Self-Defense Forces, which have been strictly limited to defending the Japanese homeland since their creation in 1954, and which for decades afterward were barely acknowledged by a public leery of anything resembling Japan's World War II era militarism. Although Mr. Abe still does not have enough public support for his long-stated goal of constitutional changes to permit Japan a full-fledged military, he is pushing Japan's purely defensive armed forces into an unfamiliar role as the standard-bearer of a more assertive foreign policy, and a deterrent against a modernizing Chinese military.""Japan is saying, 'Uh-oh, maybe with a rising China we have to start thinking differently,' "" said Sheila A. Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. ""For the first time since World War II, Japan is finding itself on the front line. And for the first time, it has to ask itself, what does an independent defense plan look like?""Rebuilt after Japan's defeat in 1945 at the encouragement of the United States, the country's technologically advanced military took a secondary role to American forces, helping patrol strategic sea lanes in the face of a Cold War-era Soviet threat. The Self-Defense Forces' role has expanded over the decades -- Japan sent 1,000 noncombat support troops to Iraq in 2004, its biggest overseas deployment since World War II -- even though the country still bars itself from possessing offensive weapons like cruise missiles considered necessary to launch full-blown attacks.With a quarter of a million uniformed personnel, Japan has slowly built up a military larger than that of other midlevel powers like France or Israel, though still far smaller than the 2.3 million-strong People's Liberation Army in China.Just how far the Self-Defense Forces have come is evident here in the islands of Okinawa, where Japan's armed forces have been assigned a more demanding -- and publicly visible -- mission.The Naha base is just a 20-minute flight by fighter jet from disputed islands that Japan controls, but China claims as its own. The islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, have provided the kindling for smoldering resentment between the countries.As China has stepped up the pressure in recent years by sending more planes and ships to patrol the islands, Japan has scrambled jets to shadow potential intruders and deployed advanced E-2 radar planes with huge dishes mounted on top to keep tabs on the Chinese while it builds a radar station on nearby Yonaguni island, Japan's first new base in decades.The tug-of-war over the islands is a proxy for a much larger battle over the shifting power balance in Asia, where China has begun to overturn the century-long supremacy of Japan, its ancient rival. Chinese military planners have called the Okinawan islands, including the disputed ones, part of China's ""first island chain"" of defense, meaning that they hope to eventually control the waters west of Japan where the United States and Japan have long held sway.While low-growth Japan is aware that it cannot match China's rapidly expanding military spending, it is trying to position its Self-Defense Forces to thwart China from trying to snatch the disputed islands, as well as to deter any designs on other Japanese-held islands. The legal changes Mr. Abe's government is working on would further free the military to come to the aid of an ally under attack, part of a broader strategy to turn Japan into a fuller military partner of the United States to try to ensure that Washington will come to Tokyo's aid if fighting breaks out over the islands.Defense analysts and American commanders agree that Japan's strongest asset is its Maritime Self-Defense Force, or MSDF, widely regarded as the world's second-most capable navy after the United States's. With a tradition dating back to Japan's formidable wartime fleet, and top hardware like the Aegis radar system, the Japanese have the only naval force, except perhaps Britain's, with the ability to work so fully and seamlessly with the United States fleet, American commanders say.This was apparent during naval war games in November involving almost 30 Japanese and American warships. As the huge American aircraft carrier George Washington launched F-18 jets, its closest escort was the Japanese guided-missile destroyer Kirishima. For the first time during such a complex exercise, a Japanese admiral was in charge of both navies' defense against simulated seaborne attacks.""The MSDF is the most capable maritime ally that we have,"" said Vice Adm. Robert L. Thomas Jr., commander of the Japan-based Seventh Fleet.While China's navy added its first aircraft carrier in 2012, defense analysts say Japan still enjoys a decades-wide advantage not only in technology but also in experience operating large warships. Japan has more of these larger, blue-water vessels like destroyers, and some of the world's stealthiest submarines.Last year, Japan launched its largest warship since World War II, the Izumo, a small aircraft carrier capable of carrying vertical-takeoff jets. The Izumo is part of a more mobile military that Japan is building to defend its far-flung islands to the south, including the contested ones -- with or without the United States, if necessary.Still, analysts say, time is on China's side, as its economic growth rates allow ever larger military budgets. While Japan's defense budget rose 2.8 percent to a record 4.98 trillion yen, or $42 billion in 2015, China announced on Thursday that its own military spending would jump 10.1 percent in the same year, to an estimated $145 billion.""The more the U.S. and Japan will do, the more China will do,"" Shen Dingli, associate dean of the Institute for International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, wrote in an email.Here at the Naha Air Base, the Japanese pilots said they tried to keep their edge with constant training. On a recent morning, they sent up a pair of F-15s to respond to a simulated intrusion, played by three other F-15s.A growing number of Chinese aircraft over the East China Sea is also keeping Naha busy, so much so that the base plans to add a second F-15 squadron this year. In a nine-month period ending last December, its pilots scrambled 379 times to intercept foreign aircraft -- a sixfold jump from those same months in 2010.""Every year, China's operational capabilities seem to be rising,"" said the Naha base commander, Maj. Gen. Yasuhiko Suzuki. ""Every year, our level of anxiety rises along with them.""",1.0
"World Briefing | Europe; Ukraine: More Than 9,100 People Killed Since Outbreak of Hostilities, U.N. Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"GENEVA -- At least 9,115 people have been killed in the 21 months since the outbreak of hostilities in eastern Ukraine in April 2014, United Nations monitors in Ukraine reported on Wednesday, an increase of more than a thousand since the United Nations' last estimate, in September. An estimated 20,797 have been injured.The casualty estimates are based on new information and do not represent an uptick in fighting, said the monitors, from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.The pace of the killing has slowed since a cease-fire in August, the monitors said, with 47 civilians killed and 131 injured in the three months ended in mid-November. They warned, however, that extrajudicial killings and torture persist in regions controlled by separatists, and that the continuing movement of foreign fighters and arms from Russia were keeping the situation ""highly flammable.""The figures are conservative, said Gianni Magazzeni, a senior United Nations human rights official, adding that the real toll is most likely significantly higher. ""There remain a large number of unidentified bodies in morgues,"" he said, especially in areas controlled by armed groups.More than half the casualties in the latest reporting period were attributed to land mines and improvised explosive devices, ""underscoring the urgent need for extensive mine clearance and mine awareness actions on both sides"" of the contact line separating Ukraine government security forces from rebel groups controlling areas around the eastern towns of Donetsk and Luhansk, the monitors found.However, the lack of government control of Ukraine's eastern border allowed the continuing movement of weapons, ammunition and fighters from Russia, which ""carries latent risks of a resurgence of hostilities.,"" they reported.Armed groups and government security services continued to commit serious abuses, the monitors said, and living conditions remained difficult for some 2.9 million people living in the areas of conflict with limited access to humanitarian aid and medical care.Extrajudicial killings, torture, illegal detention and forced labor continued in areas around Donetsk and Luhansk, the monitors said, reporting that they had no access to the places of detention run by the armed groups controlling them.""These are the places where human rights abuses are most frequently reported and where victims are most vulnerable,"" Mr. Magazzeni told reporters here.The United Nations also drew attention to hardships for civilians created by the restrictions on movements imposed by the Ukrainian government, and to the ""high degree of impunity"" enjoyed by security services, which it accused of abuses including enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and torture.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
U.S. Is Willing to Use Attack Helicopters to Help Iraqis Fight ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The United States is prepared to deploy attack helicopters and additional advisers to help Iraqi forces in their long-running battle to retake the city of Ramadi from the Islamic State, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said Wednesday.For several months now, the Iraqi security forces have been advancing on the city, cordoning it off and surrounding it. It has been a slog, Pentagon officials say, because of entrenched Islamic State positions.But as the forces make what they have billed as their final push into the city center, which will entail urban warfare, defense officials say they are considering the use of American attack helicopters. Such a move would deepen American involvement in the war and could bring helicopter pilots under increased risk from ground fire, but the Pentagon views it as a necessary step.""The United States is prepared to assist the Iraqi Army with additional unique capabilities to help them finish the job, including attack helicopters and accompanying advisers, if circumstances dictate and if requested by Prime Minister Abadi,"" Mr. Carter told a hearing Wednesday of the Senate Armed Services Committee, referring to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq.But officials said they did not envision using the American helicopters until the effort to retake Ramadi reached a critical point and such a move would be necessary to finish the job.An American military official, who asked not to be identified because he was discussing internal deliberations, said the offer to provide Apache helicopters and field advisers had recently been conveyed privately to Mr. Abadi. Mr. Abadi -- who is under pressure from hard-line Shiite politicians backed by Iran not to accept an expanded American role in Iraq -- neither accepted nor rejected the proposal, suggesting that he would weigh the offer on a case-by-case basis, according to American and Iraqi officials.Currently, the American trainers and advisers who have been working with Iraqi troops stay on bases in Iraq. If advisers were to be deployed in the field, they would be attached to select Iraqi brigades.David H. Petraeus, the former United States commander, has told Congress that the United States should consider advising Iraqi forces in the field at the brigade level.The Obama administration and the Abadi government are each walking tightropes in order to navigate the fight against the Islamic State amid the Shiite-Sunni divide in Iraq.Shiite militia leaders and politicians who are close to Iran seem to be more concerned with limiting the scope of the American involvement in Iraq than in having the Iraqi government quickly retake Ramadi, the capital of Sunni-dominated Anbar Province. But the United States is concerned that the Iraqi offensive, which is being carried out by the Iraqi Army, may drag on.Obama administration officials debated in June whether American Apache attack helicopters should be used to retake Ramadi, but the White House only recently decided to offer that option to the Iraqis.On Tuesday, Iraqi security forces recaptured a onetime military police headquarters in northern Ramadi from the Islamic State, a Pentagon official said, and Iraq's joint military command said that Iraqi forces, aided by American airstrikes, had retaken 60 percent of Ramadi. But Iraqi forces have yet to cross the river into the city center, where the real urban combat is expected to take place.Iraqi forces have dropped leaflets on Ramadi urging residents to flee via the south.Ramadi fell to the Islamic State in May after Iraqi forces withdrew en masse, an embarrassment that caused Mr. Carter to openly question their will to fight. In July, Iraqi forces began the slow grind to retake the city, and they have worked to isolate and cordon it off since.Retaking the Sunni heartland city is viewed as a key to the administration's efforts to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.""There is some risk in using attack helicopters,"" said a senior Defense Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""But it is one that we're willing to do because we think it's important to help finish the fighting in Ramadi. It's going to take time, but we're willing to do that next step.""Pentagon officials said that the United States was pushing its allies in Europe and the Persian Gulf to provide more than just attack aircraft in the fight against the Islamic State, specifically looking for them to provide Special Operations troops in Syria, as well as security training for moderate forces fighting the Islamic State.""We're asking them to step it up in our efforts in Syria, in particular,"" the official said.During the hearing, Mr. Carter expressed frustration with Sunni Arab allies who he said could do more to help with the effort against the Islamic State. ""I, too, wish that particularly the Sunni Arab nations of the gulf would do more,"" Mr. Carter said.Pentagon officials attributed the recent Iraqi successes in Ramadi to new equipment provided by the United States and a shift in training to emphasize combat engineering rather than counterinsurgency.During the hearing, Mr. Carter got into the usual back and forth with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has pushed for more American troops to be sent to fight the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.""There are 20,000 to 30,000 of them,"" Mr. McCain said. ""They are not giants. Somebody is going to have to convince me that air power alone"" is enough to defeat the militant Sunni extremist group.Mr. Carter countered that a large American deployment could do more harm that good. ""By seeming to Americanize the conflicts in Iraq and Syria,"" he said, ""we could well turn those fighting ISIL or inclined to resist their rule into fighting us instead.""Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.Photograph A Member of the Iraqi Security Forces On Monday Near Ramadi, Where the Army has Been Advancing On Islamic State Militants.

U.S. Cautious on Iran Missile Test Claim:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is facing another difficult choice with Iran: As Tehran takes apart much of its nuclear infrastructure to win sanctions relief, how vocally should the White House condemn Iranian violations of United Nations resolutions on other issues?Based on the first responses Tuesday to reports that Iran had conducted yet another launch of a medium-range ballistic missile, the answer appears to be not very loudly.Samantha Power, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said that Washington was ""conducting a serious review of the reported incident."" She said that if the review determined that the test occurred, the United States would take the issue up with the Security Council.American officials did announce some sanctions on Tuesday for ballistic missile tests -- but they were against North Korea, for violating Security Council resolutions by launching short- and medium-range missiles in tests last year.Before the Iran nuclear accord, the White House regularly condemned Tehran's tests. But now, officials say privately, they believe that the tests may be the work of angry elements in Iran's military who hope to derail the nuclear accord and preserve their atomic infrastructure.""We're seeing a lot of infighting within Iran now,"" one senior American official said.Outside analysts seemed to have little doubt about what the Iranians launched on Nov. 21: a Ghadr-110, a version of the country's Shahab-3 missile. That missile figured in the nuclear negotiations, because of evidence that Iran had conducted studies about how to shrink a nuclear device to fit into the Shahab's nose cone.The November test, if confirmed, would be a clear violation of Security Council Resolution 1929, which remains in force until the nuclear accord goes into effect -- probably in January. After that, a new Security Council resolution will take effect, in which Iran is ""called upon"" to stop work for eight years on any ballistic missiles that could deliver a nuclear weapon. But the test would not violate the nuclear accord itself.Nonetheless, the administration's cautious response drew criticism from Republicans and even some Democrats who voted in favor of the nuclear accord.""Ignoring violations of the agreement will send a troubling signal to not only Iran, but our allies in the region about our commitment to vigorously enforcing its restrictions,"" Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, Democrat of Massachusetts, said after writing a letter to President Obama with Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida.Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said in a speech on Sunday that there should be no tolerance for small violations of the nuclear agreement. Administration officials responded by noting that on the nuclear side of the agreement, Iran appears to be moving very fast to dismantle its infrastructure, in hopes of receiving over $100 billion in sanctions relief before a major national election in the spring.Separately, the United States and its European allies began circulating a draft on Tuesday of a resolution at the International Atomic Energy Agency that would close the inquiry into ""possible military dimensions"" of Iran's nuclear program, after the publication last week of a report by the agency. That report suggested such work had been intense through 2003 and continued sporadically until 2009.",1.0
Middle East; Yemen: 3 Detained Americans Are Allowed to Leave:   [Brief ],,"Three Americans have been flown out of Yemen to Oman, the Omani Foreign Ministry said Thursday, according to a report by the state-run Oman News Agency.

The brief statement gave no details about the identities of the Americans, but a Yemeni security official said the men had been detained by the rebels. ""The three Americans were detained by the security forces run by the Houthis and were held on suspicion of spying,"" the official said. The rebels, who ousted Yemen's internationally recognized government this year, have been pummeled by a military campaign led by Saudi Arabia and backed by the United States.",1.0
Questions After Strikes on Stronghold in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- First France and then Russia answered Islamic State attacks on their citizens with a strategy of direct reprisal: intensified airstrike campaigns on Raqqa, the militants' de facto capital within Syria, meant to eliminate the group's leadership and resources.But on Tuesday in the early hours of those new campaigns, there seemed to be more questions than decisive results. Chief among them: Why, if there were confirmed Islamic State targets that could be hit without killing civilians, were they not hit more heavily long ago? And what, in fact, was being hit?More broadly, the Raqqa airstrikes are renewing a debate about how effective such attacks can be in defeating or containing the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, without more commitment to measures like drying up its financial support, combating its ideology or -- what outside forces on all sides so far appear to have ruled out -- conducting a ground assault.Several people in Lebanon, Syria and Turkey who have been able to make contact with relatives in Raqqa say the recent French airstrikes -- a barrage of about 30 on Sunday night and seven more on Monday -- did not kill any civilians. But neither did they inflict serious military damage, those people said, instead hitting empty areas or buildings, or parts of the territory of factory complexes or military bases used by the Islamic State.Abdullah, a Syrian concierge in Beirut who reached his sister in Raqqa on Tuesday, said that in the case of the seven French airstrikes on Monday, ""all these strikes are targeting abandoned empty locations."" The day before, he said, the 30 French airstrikes hit mainly the outskirts of the city. ""Thank God, no civilians died,"" he said.The activist group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, which opposes both the Islamic State and the Syrian government, also insisted that no civilians had been killed in the French barrages. It had yet to post information about the Russian airstrikes that took place on Tuesday, lacking more recent updates.More French airstrikes, reaching 25 to 30, struck Raqqa late Tuesday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group in Britain that has a network of contacts in Syria. Many of the strikes hit deserted areas that had already been struck, but casualties were reported in addition to property damage, the group said.In a statement, the French Defense Ministry said that the fighter jets had taken off from Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, and that the strikes had destroyed two Islamic State command centers in Raqqa.Although the United States has conducted spot strikes within Raqqa, like the one said to have killed the Islamic State media figure known as Jihadi John, American officials say concern about the large civilian population remaining in the city has precluded heavier bombing. And even under the current rules of engagement, Syrians have reported numerous instances of civilian casualties from American airstrikes, including one in May in the town of Bir Mahli that killed at least 60 people.Many of the group's command posts in Raqqa were identified long ago, but they are in places that get heavy civilian traffic or where the Islamic State is holding civilian prisoners, like the main security office known as Point 11, inside a soccer stadium.Despite its importance as an Islamic State operational center, Raqqa has remained much more intact than Syrian cities like Homs and Aleppo, where the Syrian government has focused its efforts to eliminate rebel groups. Over the past year, though, government bombardments of the city have become more frequent, sometimes hitting schools and other civilian infrastructure, residents say.Still, even in recent months, people have fled to Raqqa from places they perceive as more dangerous. Numerous residents have moved there from Palmyra, recently taken by the Islamic State and newly coming under government airstrikes.Outside of anecdotal accounts, damage assessment in Raqqa is inherently difficult. Islamic State fighters over the past several months have been closing Internet cafes and monitoring the remaining ones more closely, making it difficult for residents to reach the outside world and to speak freely when they do. Talking to journalists is particularly risky, as was demonstrated in dramatic fashion by the murder in southern Turkey of two activists for Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently.A Syrian government supporter from Raqqa who now lives in Beirut, Lebanon, and describes himself as a kind of freelance informant for government forces, said there had long been airstrikes in or around Raqqa nearly every day. Sometimes they are executed by Syrian warplanes, other times by the American-led coalition and more recently by Russia, the informant said, using only a nickname, Shadi, to protect family members still in Raqqa. But he added: ""They don't have too much impact on ISIS's military situation.""Instead, the strikes within Raqqa have hurt locals at least as much as the Islamic State fighters who live among them, he said. In the airstrikes that have hit crowded city areas, ""one Daesh member gets killed, and 10 civilians,"" he said, using an Arabic acronym for the group.And while strikes are sometimes reported to have hit Islamic State military bases, Shadi said such strikes may sound more significant than they really were, because the bases are large and open and can get hit without doing any real damage.Despite his allegiance to the Syrian government, Shadi said that as a practical matter government airstrikes tended to hit less precisely, whereas American ones had sometimes been accurate enough to kill Islamic State commanders in their cars.Earlier Russian airstrikes in Syria, including a few on Raqqa but also in other parts, had not proved much better than the government ones, because, he said, Russians lacked ""people on the ground.""Also complicating the international effort is the disagreement between Russia and the United States over whom and what to target. Russia insists that there is little distinction between the Islamic State and other insurgent groups, like the Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front and some American-backed factions. The United States insists that the focus should be on the Islamic State, and that some other insurgent groups are legitimate opposition forces.That lingering dispute was on display on Tuesday as Russian missile strikes hit the provinces of Idlib and Aleppo farther west, in areas where the Islamic State has no known territory. In the town of Atareb, according to local insurgents, a group that has been battling the Islamic State and receiving American support was hit.The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington research group that has advocated more robust American intervention in Syria, recently called for a loosening of the rules of engagement for United States warplanes -- in other words, a relaxing of efforts to avoid killing civilians.Shadi and other Raqqa residents said that -- aside from the moral objections -- such a plan made little sense: Islamic State fighters in Raqqa seem more concerned about the ground offensive being prepared by Kurdish militias that have received American support.Shadi said the fighters had been pressuring males as young as 15 to join them to ""fight the Kurds"" and, if they refuse, imposing a ""tax"" to be used to buy a weapon for a fighter.""They are facing death every day,"" Shadi said of residents, adding that many families had sent a member to join the Islamic State because they need money or protection against the group.The Raqqa activists insisted there were no civilian casualties in the French airstrikes, and said in a Twitter post that they would not withhold such information.""Our group will be the first who will report about any civilians who will be killed or injured by any Airstrikes, whether this Airstrikes by Coalition or #France or #USA or #Russia"" or by the Syrian Army, ""so please stop Publishing lies.""They added: ""of course we don't like to see people afraid from the Airstrikes and Explosion but we support any action will take #ISIS out from #Raqqa.""At the same time, they posted maps from Google Earth of the areas where they said some of the strikes had hit -- some of which are in open areas and some of which have been abandoned.The activists said that despite the fear, some residents enjoyed a few moments of freedom when fighters took cover during airstrikes, especially women who step out on their balconies without worrying that the fighters will order them to cover up.",1.0
Russia Allies With France Against ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- Russia on Tuesday said that it was coordinating with the French military in sharply ratcheting up attacks on Syrian territory, especially areas held by the Islamic State, as the government for the first time acknowledged that a bomb had destroyed a Russian charter jet that crashed more than two weeks ago in Egypt.In a related move, President Obama said early Wednesday that he was open to cooperating with Russia in the campaign against the Islamic State, which has asserted responsibility for destroying the charter plane and for the deadly attacks in Paris on Friday, but only if the government of President Vladimir V. Putin begins targeting the militant group.The timing of the Kremlin's announcement on Tuesday, after France had already begun striking Islamic State targets and had called for a united front against the group, suggested that Russia was using the moment to help repair frayed relations with the West.The Kremlin also announced that Mr. Putin and his French counterpart, François Hollande, had spoken by telephone, had agreed to coordinate military attacks in Syria and would meet on Nov. 26 in Moscow.In a military briefing for Mr. Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, which was televised live nationwide, it was announced that Russia had deployed cruise missiles, long-range bombers and other warplanes.""A massive airstrike is targeting ISIL sites in Syrian territory,"" Mr. Shoigu said, using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State. ""The number of sorties has been doubled, which makes it possible to deliver powerful pinpoint strikes upon ISIL fighters all throughout the Syrian territory.""Mr. Putin and his defense chief were shown sitting in a three-story military command center with a map of Syria the size of a movie screen on one wall. In a scene that could have been lifted from a James Bond film, scores of military men, many wearing headsets, were lined up in desks on the main floor and overhead balconies, all facing the screen.A pariah in Western leadership circles since his invasion of Crimea last year and his support of separatists in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin was suddenly front and center at the Group of 20 summit meeting this week in Antalya, Turkey. For Mr. Putin, ending the diplomatic isolation could be an important first step in persuading the West to lift sanctions on his wobbly economy imposed because of the Ukraine dispute.Speaking after a meeting with President Benigno S. Aquino III of the Philippines, Mr. Obama, who was in Manila for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting, said he had had ""repeated discussions"" with Mr. Putin about the two militaries working more closely together.""The problem has been in their initial military incursion into Syria, they have been more focused on propping up President Assad,"" Mr. Obama said, adding that ""If in fact he shifts his focus and the focus of his military, to what is the principle threat, which is ISIL, then that is what we want to see.""Mr. Obama's comments are the most direct indication that the United States is prepared to work with Russia to counter the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.The president suggested that American officials remained skeptical about whether Mr. Putin would shift his focus toward the terrorist group, even in the wake of the Paris attacks.But he said that the Russians have been ""a constructive partner"" during diplomatic talks in Vienna last week, where foreign ministers agreed to a path to a cease-fire in Syria and an eventual political transition.Mr. Obama added that there was a ""catch"" to that cooperative spirit, saying that ""Moscow is still interested in keeping Assad in power.""He said, however, that ""those differences have not prevented us at looking at how could we set up a cease-fire.""Alexander V. Bortnikov, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service, said investigators estimated that the bomb that brought down the Metrojet Airbus A321, killing all 224 people aboard, was made of up to 1 kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of TNT. He added that ""foreign made"" explosive material had been found in the wreckage.In remarks to Russia's Security Council on Monday and broadcast on Tuesday morning, he said that ""we can say definitely that this was a terrorist act.""An ""improvised explosive device"" detonated soon after the plane took off, Mr. Bortnikov said, adding that ""the plane disintegrated in midair, which explains the widely scattered fuselage pieces.""Egyptian officials have repeatedly asserted that it was premature to conclude that an act of sabotage had destroyed the Russian jetliner, with some saying such an explanation was part of an international conspiracy against their country. But Egypt's position has become harder to maintain in recent days as the Russian government, one of its closest allies, gave increasing indications that it believed a bomb was the most likely cause. The Russians moved to sever almost all air connections with Egypt.The plane crashed minutes after departing Sharm el Sheikh, a Red Sea resort now reeling from a loss of the tourism. Russia's confirmation that the plane was felled by a bomb -- presumably smuggled through the Sharm el Sheikh airport -- could further weaken Egypt's vital tourism industry, and undermines government claims of progress in vanquishing militants based in Sinai.On Tuesday, after hours of silence following the Russian announcement, Egyptian officials seemed to be gingerly walking back their denials. Egypt's civil aviation minister said the committee investigating the crash had ""not arrived at any criminal evidence,"" but a statement from the Interior Ministry included the possibility of a ""terrorist attack,"" while announcing enhanced security measures at airports.""This is the first time that the Egyptian authorities admit the possibility that whatever happened to the Russian plane was a terrorist attack,"" said Mustapha Kamel al-Sayyid, a political science professor at Cairo University and the American University in Cairo. While the change was ""not easy"" for the Egyptian government, he said, it appeared to reflect an attempt to avoid a rift with the Russians.The Russians did not acknowledge that the Islamic State had planted the bomb. But the Russian attacks that followed on parts of Syria held by the Islamic State, presented in the live television briefing, left no doubt that the Russians were intent on showing they blamed the group.Russia fired 34 cruise missiles from the eastern Mediterranean, hitting more than a dozen targets in Aleppo and Idlib, said Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the Russian military's chief of staff.Military aircraft, including long-range bombers flying from Russia, flew 127 sorties, hitting 266 targets and destroying 140, the defense minister said. The Russian Air Force deployed in Syria has flown almost 2,300 combat missions since the attacks started 48 days ago, General Gerasimov said.""We will search for them everywhere, no matter where they are hiding,"" Mr. Putin said at a meeting with his security council broadcast on television. ""We will find them in any place on the planet and will punish them.""Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

U.S. Airstrikes Destroy Scores of ISIS Oil Trucks in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Intensifying pressure on the Islamic State, United States warplanes for the first time attacked hundreds of trucks on Monday that the extremist group has been using to smuggle the crude oil it has been producing in Syria, American officials said.According to an initial assessment, 116 trucks were destroyed in the attack, which took place near Deir al-Zour, an area in eastern Syria that is controlled by the Islamic State.The airstrikes were carried out by four A-10 attack planes and two AC-130 gunships based in Turkey.Plans for the strike were developed well before the terrorist attacks in and around Paris on Friday, officials familiar with the operation said, part of a broader operation to disrupt the ability of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, to generate revenue to support its military operations and govern its territory.American officials have long been frustrated by the ability of the Islamic State to generate tens of million of dollars a month by producing and exporting oil.To disrupt that revenue source, American officials said last week that the United States had sharply stepped up its airstrikes against infrastructure that allows the Islamic State to pump oil in Syria.Until Monday, the United States refrained from striking the fleet used to transport oil, believed to include more than 1,000 tanker trucks, because of concerns about causing civilian casualties. As a result, the Islamic State's distribution system for exporting oil had remained largely intact.The new campaign is called Tidal Wave II. It is named after the World War II effort to counter Nazi Germany by striking Romania's oil industry. Lt. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who in September assumed command of the international coalition's campaign in Iraq and Syria, suggested the name.To reduce the risk of harming civilians, two F-15 warplanes dropped leaflets about an hour before the attack warning drivers to abandon their vehicles, and strafing runs were conducted to reinforce the message.The area where the trucks assemble in Syria has been closely monitored by reconnaissance drones. As many as 1,000 trucks have been observed there, waiting to receive their cargo of illicit oil.On Monday, 295 trucks were in the area, and more than a third of them were destroyed, United States officials said. The A-10s dropped two dozen 500-pound bombs and conducted strafing runs with 30-millimeter Gatling guns. The AC-130s attacked with 30-millimeter Gatling guns and 105-millimeter cannons.The pilots saw several drivers running to a nearby tent and did not attack them, an American official said, and there were no immediate reports of civilian casualties.Col. Steven H. Warren, the American-led coalition's spokesman in Baghdad, confirmed that A-10s and AC-130s had been used in the attack and that 116 tanker trucks had been destroyed.""This part of Tidal Wave II is designed to attack the distribution component of ISIL's oil smuggling operation and degrade their capacity to fund their military operations,"" Colonel Warren said.The strike came just days after Kurdish and Yazidi fighters, backed by American airstrikes, cut an important road, Highway 47, that the Islamic State has used to move supplies and fighters between Syria and Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, which was captured by the militant group last year.That road was cut on Thursday, and Kurdish and Yazidi fighters retook the Iraqi city of Sinjar the next day.The American operation against the oil trucks followed a French raid on Sunday on two Islamic State targets in Raqqa, Syria, which allied officials identified as a headquarters building and a training camp.More than 20 bombs were dropped by French planes in the attack, an allied official said. It is not clear how much damage was caused, and no secondary explosions were observed.",1.0
Russia and Turkey Trade Insults Amid a Deepening Feud:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- The leaders of Turkey and Russia flung insults at each other on Thursday in their deepening feud over the shooting down of a Russian warplane, with President Vladimir V. Putin warning that Moscow would do more than merely ban tomatoes and construction projects to penalize Ankara.The Kremlin also said that the long-delayed transfer of the S-300 air defense system to Iran had started, a move that strengthens one of Turkey's regional rivals while raising concerns in Israel.The foreign ministers of Russia and Turkey met on Thursday in Belgrade, Serbia, on the sidelines of a conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Given the general mood in the ministers' home countries, however, the tension persisted.In Moscow, Mr. Putin, delivering his annual speech on the state of the federation, opened by repeating his call for an international coalition to fight terrorism and then suggested that the Turkish leadership was deranged. For his part, the Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, accused the Kremlin on Thursday of practicing a crude, ""Soviet-style propaganda.""Mr. Putin said that there was no need for Turkey to have shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 warplane on Nov. 24, which Ankara accused of violating its airspace but Moscow maintains was over Syria.""Allah only knows why they did it,"" Mr. Putin told a vast assembly of the Russian political elite gathered in the hall of St. George, a majestic white marble room in the Kremlin. The audience included the widows of the pilot and of another serviceman killed in the episode. ""Probably, Allah decided to punish Turkey's ruling clique by depriving it of sense and reason,"" Mr. Putin said.The Russian president said that his country's response to the attack would be measured and would avoid military threats, but that it would extend beyond the clamping down on tourism, the limited economic sanctions on agricultural products and the canceling of labor contracts already announced.""If they expected a nervous or hysterical reaction from us, if they wanted to see us become a danger to ourselves as much as to the world, they won't get it,"" Mr. Putin said. ""We are not going to rattle the saber.""Mr. Putin did, however, threaten further, unspecified actions beyond the scattered measures already announced.""If someone thinks they can commit war crimes, kill our people and get away with it, suffering nothing but a ban on tomato imports, as well as a few restrictions in construction or other industries, they're delusional,"" he said.Alexander Novak, the energy minister, announced soon after the speech that Moscow was halting talks with Ankara over the Turkish Stream gas pipeline, a $10 billion construction project meant to funnel Russian gas to Europe.Mr. Putin repeated the accusation, laid out the day before in a lengthy briefing by the Russian Ministry of Defense, that the governing Turkish elite, including the family of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was earning a fortune from oil exported by the Islamic State from Syria and Iraq.The ministry offered an exceedingly rare invitation to foreign journalists to enter its headquarters to view a series of satellite photographs showing lines of hundreds of trucks close to oil facilities and also lining up near the Turkish border.Those allegations were dismissed by Mr. Davutoglu, who said that Turkey was working to seal its border with Syria.""In the Cold War period, there was a Soviet propaganda machine,"" he told reporters in Ankara. ""Every day it created different lies. They would believe them and then expect the world to believe them.""Calling the accusations ""nonsense,"" Mr. Davutoglu added, ""This was an old tradition, but it has suddenly reared its head again.""Although the United States has expressed frustration with the Turks for not doing more to control a roughly 100-mile stretch of border that faces territory controlled by the Islamic State, Washington has rejected the accusation that Ankara is acting in league with the militants.In Belgrade, no change emerged from the 40-minute meeting between the Russian and Turkish foreign ministers, the first high-level talks in person between the two countries since the downing of the warplane.""We haven't heard anything new,"" Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said during a news conference broadcast live in Russia. Both sides stuck to their previous positions, he said.The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said after the meeting that the fight against the Islamic State should not get entangled with what he called the ""accident"" of shooting down the plane.""Foreign militants, extremists, radicalization -- these are the subjects we must focus on,"" he was quoted as saying by Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency.Russia has vowed to prevent any further attacks on its aircraft, including dispatching to Syria its powerful S-400 air defense system, which has a range of almost 250 miles.The delivery of the S-300 air defense system to Iran fulfills a contract that was delayed for years during the international confrontation with Tehran over its nuclear program. The deal was signed in 2007, suspended in 2010 and reinstated last spring.The state-run Russian news agency Tass quoted Vladimir Kozhin, the top Kremlin official responsible for military-technical cooperation, as saying the missiles were being transferred. ""The contract is in action; they've begun,"" Mr. Kozhin was quoted as saying, with no further details.Among other countries, Israel had previously expressed concern about the delivery. The S-300 missiles would render any air attack on Iran's nuclear facilities far more difficult.Analysts linked the delivery to the situation in Syria, where British warplanes on Thursday joined the United States-led coalition's bombing campaign. Tehran and Moscow back President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, while the coalition, which includes Turkey, supports the opposition and would like to see Mr. Assad gone.""Turkey is the main opponent to Russia and Iran in Syria, therefore these deliveries are connected with the overall situation in the region,"" said Alexander Golts, a columnist in Moscow, noting that the Russian Air Force was supporting Iran's ground operations in Syria.""It is more or less clear that Iran is becoming Russia's significant ally,"" Mr. Golts said. ""Therefore the Kremlin is absolutely willing to fulfill its obligations to it in full.""Although Mr. Putin spent most of his speech on internal issues, he repeated his recent call for an international coalition to fight terrorism and said Russia was mobilizing domestically against extremism.He spoke a day after the Islamic State released a grisly video of what it called a Russian spy having his throat cut by a fellow Russian fighting for the Islamic State. The executioner said Russian forces in the Middle East would be defeated and threatened to carry out attacks in Moscow like those in Paris on Nov. 13.Ramzan A. Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, confirmed that the murdered man was from his republic and vowed that the executioner would soon perish.""Chechens remember, they know, and they will not leave it unpunished,"" Mr. Kadyrov said on Thursday, speaking to reporters in the Kremlin after Mr. Putin's speech. ""Anyone who has slaughtered one of our citizens and threatens the safety of our country will not live long. We will send him to glory with a one-way ticket.""Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

Bombed Clinic Says Coalition Knew Location:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- A military coalition led by Saudi Arabia that bombed a Doctors Without Borders clinic in Yemen on Wednesday had regularly been provided with the coordinates of the clinic, the medical charity said in a statement on Thursday.The airstrikes on the clinic, in the war-torn southern city of Taiz, wounded nine people, including two Doctors Without Borders staff members, the organization said. The coordinates of the clinic had been given to Saudi officials most recently on Nov. 29, it said.""There is no way that the Saudi-led coalition could have been unaware of the presence of M.S.F. activities in this location,"" Jerome Alin, the Yemeni director for Doctors Without Borders, said in the statement, using the initials of the organization's French name, Médecins Sans Frontières. The group had also contacted the coalition shortly before the attack, when airstrikes in a nearby park appeared to threaten the clinic.The bombings on Wednesday were the second attack by the Saudi-led coalition on a Doctors Without Borders medical site in Yemen in less than two months, and the group's medical facitilties have been hit in other war zones, including in Afghanistan and Syria. In late October, the Saudi-led coalition destroyed a hospital in Yemen's northern Haydan district, near the border with Saudi Arabia.A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition did not answer calls seeking comment on the latest attack.The coalition aerial campaign began in March as a way to defeat the Houthi rebels who had captured territory across Yemen. Nine months later, the Houthis remain in control of large parts of the country and more than 2,500 civilians have been killed in the war, most of them, by coalition airstrikes, according to the United Nations and human rights groups.A report last week by the Human Rights Watch that looked at 10 airstrikes across Yemen by the Saudi-led coalition from April through August found that the attacks were not aimed at military targets, or else ""failed to distinguish civilians from military objectives,"" and most likely amounted to violations of international humanitarian law. The strikes killed at least 309 civilians, said the group, which is based in New York.Human Rights Watch said that the United States, which has supported the Saudi-led coalition, was also a ""party to the conflict by playing a direct role in coordinating military operations"" and might be party to violations of the laws of war by the coalition.The group cited statements by the commander of the Air Force Central Command, Lt. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., saying that the United States had detached personnel to a center in Saudi Arabia where the airstrikes were planned.Doctors Without Borders, citing local sources, said it evacuated its tented clinic after several airstrikes hit a park nearby around 11 a.m. on Wednesday. The group said it notified the Saudi-led coalition that their ""jet planes were mounting an attack nearby."" Then, the clinic came under attack, the group said.Few hospitals are functioning in Taiz, which has been blockaded by the Houthis for months and has been the scene of the some of the fiercest fighting in the war. Doctors Without Borders said that the clinic that was struck, in the Houban district, had treated 408 patients in the two days before the airstrikes.",1.0
C.I.A.-Trained Forces in Afghanistan Scrutinized After Civilian Deaths:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- A series of home raids by C.I.A.-trained Afghan counterterrorism forces in the last month resulted in the deaths of at least six innocent civilians, according to Afghan government officials, reviving an issue that has been a chronic source of tension between Afghanistan and the United States.The deaths happened over the course of three raids in the restive eastern province of Khost, the officials said, including a Nov. 20 episode in which a husband and wife were killed with two American advisers present. The raids were conducted by the Khost Protection Force, one of the regional units known as counterterrorism pursuit teams, set up by the C.I.A. to fight the Taliban, the Haqqani network and Al Qaeda.The C.I.A. has trained thousands of Afghan forces for such missions -- around 3,500 in the Khost Protection Force alone. But from the start, some senior Afghan officials have considered them a problem, accused of human rights abuses and seen as largely unaccountable.The C.I.A. began dismantling or shrinking the teams as the agency began a partial withdrawal from Afghanistan in recent years. And control of the pursuit teams was officially shifted to the Afghan intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, from the C.I.A. two years ago, at the request of Afghan officials.But some now say the remaining Afghan counterterrorism forces are still largely unaccountable to the government.One former senior Afghan government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence issues, said that the transfer of authority in some cases had not been completed. ""The main problem is that there are a number of people working for the C.I.A. who will not work for the Afghan armed forces,"" the former official said.There are also concerns about former members of the teams who were paid a $2,000 severance and dismissed by the C.I.A. ""That could cause problems for us in the future,"" the former official said, particularly if those highly trained people were to end up on the wrong side of the law.The National Security Directorate did not reply to requests for comment, and officials in the office of President Ashraf Ghani did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Wednesday. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment.One American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a classified security force, defended the Khost pursuit team as ""one of the most effective elements fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.""The official added, ""This is a group made up of thousands of soldiers who come from the area and consequently have the respect and insights necessary to operate in a professional manner despite the constant engagement with the enemy.""Khost has long been a critical battlefield, as it is a strategic gateway for Taliban and the Haqqani network to bring fighters into Afghanistan from their havens in the Pakistani tribal areas across the border. It is also a crucial corridor to Kabul, and American and Afghan officials have long felt that gains by the Taliban there could pose a threat to the capital.In the latest militant attack in Khost, a roadside bomb attack on Wednesday apparently aimed at Habib Khan Taniwal, a member of the provincial council, killed two people and wounded seven others, including three of his bodyguards, officials in the province said. Mr. Taniwal survived.The first Khost Protection Force raid under scrutiny happened on Nov. 7 in the Dery neighborhood of the provincial capital, Khost City. Operatives arrived in pickup trucks and raided a home there, killing a 45-year-old man and his 17-year-old nephew -- both described as innocent civilians by Abdul Wahed Patan, deputy to the Khost governor.About 1,000 people protested those killings, trying to carry the bodies of the two victims to the regional capital, according to people who participated in the demonstrations. They were stopped en route by the counterterrorism force and told to go back or face a possible assault by American troops, they said. The protesters went home.In another raid in Khost City, on Nov. 11, a 50-year-old man and his 26-year-old son were wrongfully killed, according to Mr. Patan and the district governor, Jawid Joshan.In the Nov. 20 raids, the Khost force, accompanied by two American advisers, arrived by helicopter around 1:30 a.m., dismounted and raided three houses in the district of Zazi Maidan, according to General Azizullah, the district police chief.One of the houses belonged to a recently discharged Afghan Army soldier named Ibrahim Jan. Neighbors said that Mr. Jan had heard noises and ran outside with his assault rifle to protect his family. Members of the counterterrorism force had climbed onto his roof, and shot and killed him before he fired. When his wife ran out to him, they gunned her down, too, the neighbors said.It is not unusual for Afghans to be armed, and the police in Khost have often allowed some at-risk people to carry weapons for personal protection. As a former soldier, Mr. Jan would most likely have feared being singled out as a target by the Taliban.At another house in Zazi Maidan, belonging to a man named Mia Gul, the Khost Protection Force seized weapons and detained two men, Mr. Gul and his brother Rahmat Gul, and took them to the Camp Chapman base nearby, local officials said. Mia Gul was released the next morning, but Rahmat Gul remains in custody.Home raids have long been a source of outrage -- and civilian casualties -- for Afghans, and in 2013 American commanders sharply limited them at the demand of former President Hamid Karzai.But even after the formal end of the NATO combat mission last year, such raids have again become common. American officials have described them as a crucial weapon against militants, but the raids are still a source of concern when they come to light.""As long as the so-called U.S. war on terror is unwisely conducted in the Afghan villages and towns, there will certainly be civilian casualties,"" said Aimal Faizi, who served as spokesman to Mr. Karzai and has been a critic of Mr. Ghani's government.""It is the responsibility of the Afghan government to protect its citizens,"" he added, ""but the national unity government seems to be disregarding cases of civilian casualties in Afghanistan involving U.S. forces.""Ashley Jackson, a former United Nations official in Kabul and now a research associate at the Overseas Development Institute in London, said that with the transition to Afghan-led forces, the actions of shadowy units like the counterterrorism pursuit teams are harder to examine. ""There's less and less accountability,"" she said. ""There's less Western focus, and fewer people care.""Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: Asian Morning newsletter.

British Jets Hit ISIS in Syria After Parliament Authorizes Strikes:   [Foreign Desk ],,"LONDON -- The British Parliament on Wednesday authorized airstrikes in Syria against the Islamic State, in a vote that became a wider test of British willingness to play an active role in international affairs, and British warplanes made their first attacks hours later.Early on Thursday, the Defense Ministry said that four Tornado jets took off from the Akrotiri Royal Air Force Base in Cyprus and returned to base safely after carrying out airstrikes, according to British news reports. The ministry did not provide specific details of the airstrikes.The vote, after months of wrangling, hand-wringing and a daylong parliamentary debate, underscored the concerted efforts of Prime Minister David Cameron, whose Conservative Party has a majority in Parliament, to restore Britain's reputation as a serious global actor.""The threat is very real,"" Mr. Cameron said of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, on Wednesday, as he opened the debate in the House of Commons. ""The question is this: Do we work with our allies to degrade and destroy this threat?""In the end, British lawmakers opted to try to do so, voting by 397 to 223 to go along with Mr. Cameron's plan, despite some forceful speeches against the strikes.The run-up to the vote also amounted to a low point for Jeremy Corbyn, the new leader of the opposition Labour Party. While Mr. Corbyn opposes British military action over Syria, some of Labour's senior figures, including the party's spokesman on foreign affairs, Hilary Benn, supported it, and Mr. Corbyn was forced to allow his lawmakers to vote freely on the issue in an effort to avoid a intraparty clash amid threatened resignations.In an impassioned speech that won a rousing reception Wednesday night, Mr. Benn argued that ""every state has the right to defend itself"" and asked ""why would we not uphold the settled will of the United Nations?""His contribution to the debate appeared to have helped Mr. Cameron secure the ""clear majority"" in the parliamentary vote that he said he was seeking.While there are serious questions about the extent to which British airstrikes would make a difference in the fight against the Islamic State -- the military is already conducting strikes against the militants in Iraq -- the issue has always been more about alliance solidarity and leadership than about strict military or strategic utility.""It will not make a big operational difference,"" said Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute, a research organization specializing in security.""It is important symbolically, useful operationally, but not transformative,"" he said. ""A willingness to deploy will allay the concern that the U.K. is not a reliable partner.""In his first term, as head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, Mr. Cameron earned a reputation for lack of interest in foreign policy that seemed to contradict Britain's history, or its status as a nuclear power and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.After Britain joined France's military intervention in 2011, with NATO support, to overthrow Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, resulting in considerable chaos in North Africa, Mr. Cameron appeared to pull back from military action.While France fought Islamic radicals in Mali, bombed the Islamic State in Syria and made a diplomatic push seeking to resolve the Ukraine crisis with Russia, Mr. Cameron lost a parliamentary vote in 2013 seeking to authorize military action against President Bashar al-Assad of Syria for his use of chemical weapons.And despite hosting the 2014 NATO summit meeting in Wales, where he led pledges to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on the military, Mr. Cameron was reluctant to follow through, citing a need to reduce Britain's national deficit. The failure to honor the 2 percent commitment caused enormous friction with the Obama administration, and regular American demands -- quietly in public but very loudly in private -- that Britain keep its word.After winning a surprising but narrow majority in the general election in May, however, Mr. Cameron moved to restore Britain's reputation on the global stage and to play a more visible role in foreign policy.He found the resources to commit to the 2 percent threshold, committed to buying F-35 fighter jets and maritime patrol planes for Britain's new aircraft carriers, and vowed to renew Britain's submarine-based nuclear deterrent. He is now seeking to follow through on his promise to expand airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.Mr. Cameron has announced an increase in military spending in real terms of 3 percent over the next four years, including for special forces, intelligence gathering and a doubling of Britain's drone fleet.Nevertheless, after the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, Britons remain wary about involvement in Syria, and Mr. Cameron has had to spend considerable effort cajoling lawmakers -- including in his own party -- to support him.""This is not 2003,"" Mr. Cameron said while opening the parliamentary debate on Wednesday. ""We must not use past mistakes as an excuse for indifference or inaction.""Britain's ""reputation as a serious world player was damaged by the defense cuts announced in 2010 and by the parliamentary vote to refuse military force in 2013,"" Mr. Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute said.For one former minister, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, ""symbolism is more important than the effect.""""We are already at war, and the Rubicon was crossed a long time ago,"" the former minister argued, referring to the air campaign in Iraq and adding that Mr. Cameron ""has found it very embarrassing that Britain is not at the top table.""Mr. Cameron has argued that British military action in Iraqi airspace alone makes no sense, as the Islamic State does not recognize the Iraq-Syria border and the militants have their headquarters in Syria.He has also said that further military action was necessary to stem terrorist acts like the ones that struck Paris on Nov. 13, leaving 130 dead, and that it would be an essential component of any diplomatic solution to the Syrian civil war, which has displaced up to half that country's population.Mr. Cameron also argued that airstrikes on Islamic State in Syria will not make Britain any more vulnerable.""If there is an attack on the U.K. in the coming weeks or months, there will be those who try to say it's happened because of our airstrikes,"" he said.

Lebanon Exchanges Prisoners With Qaeda Branch:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The Syrian branch of Al Qaeda on Tuesday released 16 Lebanese servicemen captured more than a year ago in a rare prisoner exchange brokered by Qatar that included a woman said to be a former wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of the Islamic State jihadist organization.Masked gunmen waving black flags and driving pickup trucks brought the servicemen, dressed in black and sporting long beards but apparently in good health, to the outskirts of the Lebanese town of Arsal, near the Syrian border, according to footage broadcast by Al Jazeera. After shaving and donning crisp uniforms, the men were driven to Beirut for an official celebration.The swap deal, which had fallen through before, only partially concluded a painful chapter in Lebanon's struggle with the civil war in neighboring Syria, which has flooded the small country with refugees and increased tensions among its political factions.It also highlighted the power of Qatar, a tiny but fabulously wealthy Persian Gulf state that backs armed groups in Syria seeking to topple the government. This was the latest example of Qatar's using its wealth and connections to Islamists and extremists in the Middle East to win the release of prisoners.The servicemen, who included members of the Lebanese Army and its General Security force, were among a group captured in August 2014 during a joint attack on Arsal by militants from the Islamic State and the Syrian affiliate of Al Qaeda, the Nusra Front. Both groups took prisoners.Eight of those captives were subsequently released. Two were killed in captivity by the Islamic State and two others by the Nusra Front. One other died of wounds sustained in the battle for the town.Tuesday's swap freed only the remaining 16 captives held by the Nusra Front. They were exchanged for 25 prisoners held by Lebanon, including 17 women and their children, according to a statement by the Qatari Foreign Ministry.The Nusra Front also handed over the remains of one of the servicemen it had killed, Mohammad Hamiyeh.Nine Lebanese servicemen are believed to still be captives of the Islamic State, an enemy of the Nusra Front that split with Al Qaeda in 2014.Several released soldiers told television interviewers that they had generally been well treated by the Nusra Front, and they expressed hope that their colleagues held by the Islamic State would be released soon.The Lebanese and Qatari governments did not identify the prisoners Lebanon had released, but a Lebanese security official said on the condition of anonymity because of government protocol that Saja al-Dulaimi, believed by Lebanese officials to be a former wife of the Islamic State leader, was among those released. Ms. Dulaimi was arrested last year while trying to enter Lebanon with forged documents.At the time, Iraqi officials denied that she had been married to Mr. Baghdadi.In a brief interview with Al Jazeera, Ms. Dulaimi said that she and Mr. Baghdadi had been divorced for six or seven years and that she hoped to return to Beirut and then go to Turkey. The Lebanese news media also reported the release of the wife of a Nusra Front leader.The captives' fates have transfixed Lebanon and fueled political wrangling at home amid a political stalemate that has left the country without a president for more than a year.In Beirut, the capital, where families of the captive servicemen had pitched tents and kept vigil to pressure the government to negotiate their release, citizens gathered to celebrate and welcome the freed men.",1.0
Pentagon Officials Say They'll Bolster Special Operations Force in Iraq:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon will expand its Special Operations force in Iraq as part of a ramped-up war effort against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter told a House hearing on Tuesday.Mr. Carter said that a specialized expeditionary American military force would be able to target Islamic State militants in Iraq and make targeted raids into Syria. ""These special operators will over time be able to conduct raids, free hostages, gather intelligence and capture ISIL leaders,"" Mr. Carter said, using an acronym for the Islamic State.Mr. Carter did not say precisely how many new forces would be added but said they would be more than 50. He also did not say where exactly they would be based in Iraq. A Defense Department official said on Tuesday that these would be new troops and not troops reassigned from other parts of Iraq.President Obama has already authorized the deployment up to 50 special operators in Syria to help organize Arab and Kurdish fighters there.""We are at war,"" Mr. Carter told the House Armed Services Committee. He appeared alongside General Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Mr. Carter's comments came at a testy hearing that featured familiar themes: Republican lawmakers complained that the Obama administration does not have a strategy for dealing with the rise of the Islamic State, and called for more American forces on the ground in both places, while Mr. Carter's carefully worded answers seemed to reflect the caution of his boss, who has been loath to send more troops to the region after more than a decade of war.Defense officials said the new special operators would work with Kurdish and Iraqi troops in Iraq, as well as possibly Syrian and Arab troops, during targeted raids in Syria. Mr. Carter called the new operators a ""standing force"" based in Iraq.""I think you can expect to see a slow ramp-up"" of American forces in Iraq and perhaps even Syria, a Defense Department official said Tuesday, speaking on grounds of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly. ""The consensus is there; it's just a question of how quickly the White House wants to move.""An American military official, who asked not to be identified because he was talking about confidential plans, said the new force would look to conduct raids against Islamic State leaders in Iraq and Syria -- what the Pentagon calls ""high-value targets."" In addition, they would help analyze intelligence, identify targets and collaborate with Iraq's special forces.The move appears to be one of a series of steps the Obama administration is taking to raise the pressure on the Islamic State without fundamentally altering its cautious strategy. It is a step that has long been proposed by some of the administration's conservative critics, who have also urged the administration to deploy advisers with Iraqi brigades and use American Apache helicopters.The president has resisted such moves, which could bring American forces into closer contact with Islamic State militants. Mr. Obama's backers say he is wary of taking over the fight from the Iraqis, who some officials argue must lead the effort to drive the Islamic State out of their own country.But after avoiding the war in Syria for four years now, Mr. Obama has, in recent weeks and amid a worsening crisis, deepened American involvement in the war there. In agreeing to send 50 special operators to Syria in October, Mr. Obama crossed a line that he had refused to step over, committing American ground forces inside Syria. Military officials say they expect the number of special operators in Syria to increase in the coming months.Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said the deployment of more troops was ""a belated step forward"" in a written statement. But he called it ""yet another reactive and incremental step, adding, ""A comprehensive strategy to defeat ISIL is totally absent, urgently needed and long overdue.""The American escalation has come as Russia has inserted itself into the multisided civil war to support President Bashar al-Assad, bombing opposition forces initially and then, eventually, Islamic State targets, after the militant group claimed credit for downing a Russian passenger jet over Egypt. The White House has since taken pains not to characterize any American ramp-up as a response to the Russian moves.Once intent on using only American air power to help local forces on the ground, Mr. Obama has now sent 3,500 American troops to Iraq, mostly to advise and train Iraqi troops.""And there will be more,"" Mr. Carter said.He said the United States would continue to increase its presence in Iraq. ""We've intensified the air campaign against ISIL's war-sustaining oil enterprise, a critical pillar"" of the group's financial infrastructure, he told the committee. General Dunford said attacks by the American-led coalition in the last month against the Islamic State had disrupted 43 percent of the group's revenue stream.Mr. Carter said the new special operators could help in Syria as well, alluding to the pursuit of high-value targets like Islamic State leaders. ""It puts everybody on notice in Syria.

Europe; Russia: Turkey Returns Pilot's Body:   [Brief ],,"The body of Lt. Col. Oleg A. Peshkov, the Russian Air Force pilot killed after his warplane was shot down by Turkey on Nov. 24, was returned to Russia on Monday. Turkey secured the release of his body from inside Syria, and it was flown from Ankara to a military airfield near Moscow, according to Russian news reports. Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu and Gen. Viktor N. Bondarev, the commander in chief of the Russian Air Force, met the plane. After his Sukhoi Su-24 bomber had been shot by a Turkish F-16, Colonel Peshkov parachuted from the plane and was killed by ground fire as he floated into Syrian territory. Turkey insisted that the plane had briefly violated its airspace, a claim Russia denied.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"North Korean Test of Submarine-Launched Missile Was Unsuccessful, South Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea conducted a rare test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile over the weekend, but it ended in failure, said a South Korean lawmaker who attended a closed-door parliamentary briefing by the National Intelligence Service on Monday.Joo Ho-young, a governing party lawmaker and chairman of the National Assembly's Intelligence Committee, cited officials from the intelligence service, the South's main spy agency, as saying that North Korea had conducted the test on Saturday off Wonsan, a port city east of Pyongyang, with its leader, Kim Jong-un, watching.But there was no sign that the missile was successfully ejected from the submarine and took off, Mr. Joo told reporters after the intelligence officials briefed his committee. No rocket trajectory was detected, and what appeared to be debris from a missile was later seen floating on the surface of the sea, he said.The intelligence service declined to comment on the closed-door parliamentary session.On Monday, Kim Min-seok, the main spokesman for the Defense Ministry of South Korea, declined to provide details, saying that information related to ""the North's launching of an S.L.B.M.,"" or submarine-launched ballistic missile, remained classified.""What we can say is that North Korea is continuing the development and testing of an S.L.B.M.,"" Mr. Kim said. ""It is a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions banning it from developing or testing ballistic missiles.""Fears in the South of North Korean missile threats have grown since May, when the North claimed that it had successfully test-fired such a weapon and released photographs of Mr. Kim observing a missile soaring out of the water.Some missile experts have since questioned the claim, however, saying that the photographs appeared to have been modified. They said the North was probably still many years away from developing a submarine-launched ballistic missile, which would present a hard-to-detect danger for its enemies in the region. But South Korean officials maintained that the North had successfully fired a submarine-launched missile, which flew nearly 500 feet before falling into the sea. They said they expected more such tests.As it vowed to counter the North's growing missile threat, South Korea said in June that it had successfully test-fired its first ballistic missile with a range great enough to hit any part of North Korea. The South's president, Park Geun-hye, was said to have watched that test.",1.0
Taiwan: Old Enemies Exchange Spies:   [Brief ],,"China and Taiwan have engaged in rare exchange of spies, the office of Taiwan's president announced on Monday. The exchange, while made public now, actually took place in mid-October, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense said in a statement. China released two officers from Taiwan's Bureau of Military Intelligence, and they were returned to Taiwan. The men, Chu Kung-hsun and Hsu Chang-kuo, had been arrested in Vietnam near the border with China in 2006 and given life sentences, which were later reduced to 20 years, according to the Taiwanese newspaper China Times, which first reported the exchange. A Chinese spy imprisoned in Taiwan, Li Zhihao, was given early parole as part of the exchange, Charles Chen, a spokesman for Taiwan's presidential office, said in a statement. The exchange of spies, Mr. Chen said, was a sign of improved relations between China and Taiwan.",1.0
"Kurds, Backed by U.S. Air Power, Open an Offensive Against ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"Latest updates: For the latest news on the battle for Sinjar, please click here.Kurdish forces aided by thousands of lightly armed Yazidi fighters began a long-awaited offensive early Thursday to reclaim Mount Sinjar and an accompanying town from the Islamic State, which seized the northern Iraqi territory last year and murdered, raped and enslaved thousands of Yazidis.United States-led coalition air forces pounded the area in preparation for the offensive, which also sought to cut a major jihadist supply line between Syria and the Iraqi city of Mosul.A statement from the security council of the Kurdish autonomous region in Iraq said that up to 7,500 Kurdish pesh merga fighters were moving on ""three fronts to cordon off Sinjar City, take control of ISIL's strategic supply routes, and establish a significant buffer zone to protect the city and its inhabitants from incoming artillery."" ISIL is an acronym for the Islamic State.""Coalition warplanes will provide close air support to pesh merga forces throughout the operation,"" the statement said.Describing the unfolding battle, Kurdish officials said that pesh merga forces had taken the village of Gabara, west of Sinjar, and had cut the highway between the city and Syria.As the campaign got underway, long columns of pesh merga vehicles, including pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and a small number of armored vehicles, snaked their way across Mount Sinjar as airstrikes boomed in the distance.Some of the fighters walked alongside the vehicles, headed for the front.The battle plan called for the pesh merga, joined by Yazidi forces, to sweep down from Mount Sinjar to attack fighters for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, on multiple fronts. Kurdish officials said there could be as many as 700 Islamic State fighters in and around Sinjar, including foreign jihadists.""We have made our plans, but not everything goes according to plan,"" Maj. Gen. Aziz Waisi, the commander of the Zeravani Force, which is leading one of the prongs of the Kurdish offensive, said earlier. ""It is war, we have a determined enemy and there are always surprises from ISIS.""The operation, which comes as the American-led coalition is trying to regain the initiative in the struggle with the Islamic State, holds out the possibility of progress along a new front in northern Iraq against the militants.The aim is to add pressure on Islamic State fighters who are being pressed militarily in northeast Syria and Iraq. They are currently partly encircled in Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province in Iraq, and were recently evicted from Baiji in northern Iraq, site of a strategic oil refinery.The pesh merga also plan to cut the supply line, Highway 47, the major east-west road that runs past Sinjar and connects Syria to Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, which the Islamic State captured last year. That would hamper the easy movement of fighters, fuel and supplies within the Islamic State's self-declared caliphate and force the militants to resort to less efficient smuggling routes.Still, the operation faces several important military and political challenges.Even if the Sinjar campaign succeeds, the Islamic State still has a stranglehold on vital areas in the region, including Mosul and large portions of eastern Syria and western Iraq. That includes most of the Sunni Arab heartland of Anbar Province, where a government-led military push has advanced toward Ramadi but has not yet managed to retake it from the Islamic State.Before the Islamic State swept across northern Iraq, the area was a political stronghold for the Kurdistan Democratic Party of President Massoud Barzani, the leader of the Kurdish autonomous region in Iraq, who is overseeing the Sinjar operation from a command post in northwest Iraq.But many Yazidis -- a tiny religious minority that was almost entirely based around Mount Sinjar before the Islamic State's advance -- blame the pesh merga and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, commonly known as the K.D.P., for failing to prevent Sinjar's fall in the first place and subjecting them to a catalog of horrors by the Islamic State, including the sexual enslavement of thousands of women.That calamity led to the flight of hundreds of thousands of Yazidis, tens of thousands of whom spent a week or more exposed to a blazing August sun on the barren slopes of Mount Sinjar with little food or water.While a Yazidi regiment is to participate in part of the pesh merga offensive, other Yazidi fighters have been operating independently, and all are eager to exact revenge on the Islamic State fighters for their actions 15 months ago, when they overran Mount Sinjar.Tactically, preparations for the Sinjar offensive have been underway for weeks, and the Islamic State appears to have anticipated the assault and has been sending reinforcements, General Waisi said.With more than a year to dig in, the militants are also believed to have fortified their positions and made plans for a counterstrike.Throughout the conflict, the Islamic State has used improvised explosive devices to create dense minefields. The aim is to slow down attacking forces and channel them into ""kill zones"" so they can be targeted with sniper fire, mortars or machine-gun fire. Many of the houses in Sinjar are believed to be rigged with explosives.Using suicide car bombs, the militants are also poised to mount counterattacks from Tal Afar to the east, from the towns of Blij and Baaj to the south and from Syria to the west.""They try to identify a weak point in the defense and then send everything possible to that single point,"" General Waisi said. ""It starts with suicide bombers and then heavy machine guns. We know their tactics, but there will be surprises.""The operation on Thursday was timed to coincide with forecasts of several days of clear weather. That would enable the United States to provide more air power, including A-10 Warthog attack jets based in Turkey.Still, coping with the Islamic State's improvised explosive devices will not be easy for the pesh merga, who suffered losses of more than two dozen, virtually all from such explosives, in a recent operation near Kirkuk, according to allied officials.Unlike the Iraqi Army forces surrounding Ramadi, the pesh merga have not been provided with special breaching equipment, in which a cable festooned with explosives is used to blast a path through a minefield.The pesh merga have received 40 mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles, or MRAPs, from the United States, 15 of which have special rollers attached to clear mines. But Kurdish officials say the vehicles are not nearly enough given the 600-mile front the Kurds share with the Islamic State. Nor have armored Humvees or armored bulldozers been provided by the Americans.American officials say that more MRAPs and armored Humvees will be provided if the pesh merga follow through with plans to establish two new brigades that will integrate fighters from the Kurds' two dominant political parties: the K.D.P. and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. But action to establish those brigades has yet to be taken, and the process of equipping and training them would take several months.The pesh merga have received hundreds of Milan antitank missiles from Germany and 1,000 AT4 antitank weapons from the United States, officials say. Kurds say the Milan missiles have proved to be the most useful in defending against suicide vehicle attacks, but pesh merga commanders say they need more of them.The American-led coalition has also provided the pesh merga with a large number of small arms, including machine guns, rifles, mortar tubes and mortar rounds. As the Sinjar offensive has approached, Kurdish officials say, the coalition has been rushing in new supplies of ammunition as well.An Italian colonel has been leading a multinational effort to train the Kurdish forces at three bases in Iraqi Kurdistan. American, Canadian and other foreign Special Operations forces have also been advising the pesh merga at their defensive positions in the Kurdish region, although officials said they would not be accompanying the Kurdish forces to Sinjar.After a year of occupation by the Islamic State, as well as American airstrikes and constant skirmishes, Sinjar is a wreck. Kurdish officials do not plan to return civilians there anytime soon or to quickly rebuild the town, which could remain vulnerable to occasional artillery and mortar attacks from Islamic State militants to the south.Still, there have been tensions in recent weeks between the pesh merga and the main Syrian Kurdish militia, which is also operating on the Iraqi side of the border. The friction concerns who will participate in the operation and, perhaps more important, who will control the area if the Islamic State were to be pushed out.Analysts say the Yazidis still have not forgiven the K.D.P. for retreating in the face of the Islamic State offensive last year, leaving them vulnerable to the jihadis, who consider the Yazidis infidels. Their sympathies now lie more with a Syrian affiliate of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which came to their rescue and established a permanent base there.""Yazidi support has shifted away from the K.D.P.,"" said Christine van den Toorn, who directs the Institute for Regional and International Studies at the American University of Iraq, Sulaimaniya. ""If Sinjar is to be retaken from ISIS, repopulated and rebuilt, the K.D.P. cannot be the only liberator and ruler.""Even if Sinjar is retaken and the highway is cut, more military steps will need to be taken if the American-led coalition wants to cut off supplies from Syria to Mosul, said Michael Knights, a military expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.""It will slow down the flow of Islamic State traffic to and from Mosul,"" Mr. Knights said. ""That traffic will be forced to move on desert tracks and local roads to the south of Sinjar, which will greatly reduce the flow.""And if winter rain floods the wadis,"" he said, ""those secondary routes could be unavailable.""Map The Operation Comes As the American-Led Coalition Is Trying to Regain the Initiative in the Struggle with the Islamic State.",1.0
U.S. Strategy to End Killing in Syria Is Met With Doubts:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- For the first time in the four-year Syrian civil war, President Obama is beginning to execute a combined diplomatic and military approach to force President Bashar al-Assad to leave office and end the carnage.As 50 Special Operations troops arrive in Syria to bolster the most effective opposition groups, the administration is gambling that Secretary of State John Kerry will have more leverage to push Russia, Iran and other players toward two objectives: a cease-fire to limit the cycle of killing and the establishment of a timeline for a transition of power.But the task is enormous, given the number of nations and rebel groups operating at cross-purposes and the tiny size of the American force. Even senior members of the administration express doubts in private about whether the effort is sufficient.While Mr. Kerry has been optimistic that diplomacy can end the carnage, and has criticized the White House internally for moving too slowly, he has conceded doubts to aides that his strategy of fast-paced diplomacy can harness so many fiercely opposed forces toward a political solution.Mr. Kerry will travel to Vienna this weekend, summoning many of Syria's neighbors and European powers to turn a vague declaration of principles, settled on two weeks ago, into a plan for a political agreement. The talks, at least so far, have not included representatives of Mr. Assad's government or the fractured rebel groups seeking to depose him, and Mr. Kerry is struggling to bring them to the negotiating room.But after years in which the Obama administration has been accused of largely sitting on the sidelines while a quarter-million Syrians died and millions more were displaced, Mr. Kerry seems buoyed by being at the center of the only diplomatic effort underway.""I can tell you that as long as he thinks there is a glimmer of possibility, he will not let go,"" Wendy R. Sherman, Mr. Kerry's under secretary for policy until six weeks ago, said recently.The move to increase pressure to create negotiating leverage echoes the strategy that the administration employed to force Iran into negotiations that led to a nuclear deal last summer. That effort, which involved economic sanctions, a bolstered military presence in the Persian Gulf and covert action, produced perhaps the most complex arms negotiations in American history.Yet in the Iran case, most of the world's major powers were in agreement. On Syria, there is no such unanimity.Russia and Iran remain Mr. Assad's two greatest protectors, though American officials detect a division on the question of whether Mr. Assad must stay in power. The Russians appear to have little faith that Mr. Assad can hold on, while the Iranians have dismissed the idea of looking for an alternative to him, though that may simply be posturing.On the other side of the table, America's partners are also divided. Saudi Arabia had to be dragged to the negotiations by Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry, after saying that a deal with Iran, its regional enemy, would be a fruitless exercise, and that Mr. Obama was being manipulated by the Iranians and the Russians in a bid for time.Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries have largely ceased participating in the air war over Syria, focusing instead on fighting insurgents in Yemen. Privately, many of the foreign ministers who attended the last Vienna session two weeks ago questioned whether Syria could survive as an independent country. Many intelligence analysts providing reports to Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry have expressed similar doubts.""I think this is not a strategy -- it's more like a line of effort,"" said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""There are different lines of effort now, all part of the evolution of the great game of Syria.""The Russians have floated a proposal that would provide for elections and leave open the possibility that Mr. Assad would guide the process, several diplomats at the United Nations who had seen it said on Tuesday. They said the proposal does not cite Mr. Assad by name. But American and many European officials have said any election must not be in Mr. Assad's control -- and must include Syrians who have fled the country.The United Nations' special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters at its New York headquarters on Tuesday that he hoped the Vienna meeting would deliver a concrete outcome, including a ""reduction in violence.""For Mr. Kerry, the Syria effort has become an obsession, much like his failed bid to strike an Israeli-Palestinian accord in 2013 and his so-far successful effort on the Iran nuclear deal this year. On a trip through Central Asia last week, he used every spare moment to make telephone calls from his plane or hotel to keep the diplomatic effort on track.The Syria situation ""may or may not be ripe"" for solution, Mr. Kerry told students at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard before he left on the trip. ""But it's imperative. It's a human catastrophe, a disaster that screams at all of us in public life to exercise responsibility in trying to find a solution.""At White House meetings, administration officials say, Mr. Kerry has argued that without applying both military and diplomatic pressure, the Russian intervention that began in late September would shore up Mr. Assad ""and actually wind up destroying Syria.""But the question is whether the military element of the strategy -- which reversed Mr. Obama's previous determination to keep American combat troops out of the country -- will be enough to make a difference.""What he is doing will not work,"" Fareed Zakaria, a journalist whom Mr. Obama frequently speaks with, wrote in a column in The Washington Post last week. ""In a few months,"" he predicted, the United States ""will face the challenge again -- back down or double down. So far, President Obama has responded each time with increased intervention.""Reflecting a willingness to do more, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said Sunday that additional troops could be sent to Syria if the United States could find more local forces to work with.The White House is hoping that the Syrian, Arab and Kurdish coalition, aided by American pilots and special operators on the ground, can seize and hold territory. The United States also plans to step up airstrikes. Mr. Obama deployed 12 A-10 warplanes and is sending additional F-15 fighter jets to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey.The theory is that over time the combination will increase the pressure on Mr. Assad to step down. The immediate focus is not on Mr. Assad's strongholds, though; it is on territory seized by the Islamic State, including its capital, Raqqa.But there is a far more immediate problem: identifying friends and enemies on the ground in Syria. Several rebel groups aided by the United States have been bombed by the Russians in recent weeks. American officials say they believe that Russia is trying to wipe out Mr. Assad's opponents while claiming that it is going after the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.Eventually, American and Russian officials will have to share lists about the groups that they support and that could be credible interlocutors for a cease-fire and political solution. But the United States has declined to do so, for fear that the Russians or Mr. Assad would immediately target the groups for attacks.Then would come the practical problem of engineering a cease-fire and a referendum to replace Mr. Assad.The 50 Special Operations troops, American officials said, will attach themselves to commanders of the tribal affiliates in northern Syria and coordinate with the Kurdish militia known as the Y.P.G. That group has dealt the Islamic State its most significant setbacks across northern Syria near the Turkish border.""You've got the elements of a combined political and military strategy,"" said Derek Chollet, a former assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. ""That, to me, is the key part -- beating ISIS for our own interest, but changing the complexion of the Syrian opposition so that the moderates are the more powerful ones. That is key to getting Assad out.""Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.",1.0
"NATO Exercise Unwittingly Put Soviets on 'Hair Trigger' in '83, Analysis Suggests:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"In December 1988, Jörg Winger was a West German Army radio operator eavesdropping on Soviet military channels when he overheard a startling message: The Russians wished him Merry Christmas by name.""That was the moment where we realized that we had moles on the base,"" he recalled.Mr. Winger, now a television producer, and his wife, Anna LeVine Winger, an American author, later harvested that incongruous holiday greeting as grist for a retro series, ""Deutschland 83."" They consulted a historian who provided an even more dramatic narrative arc: In 1983, according to recently declassified documents, the Russians apparently became convinced that a NATO nuclear training exercise code named Able Archer 83 was a cover for an actual nuclear strike against the Warsaw Pact nations.Last month, the American government finally declassified a presidential analysis of Able Archer and the Russian response that definitively dramatized how the two superpowers came closer to a nuclear war than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis two decades earlier -- and, this time, by accident.""In this case truth turned out to be at least as strange as fiction,"" said Klaas Voss, the historian at the Hamburg Institute for Social Research who advised the producers. ""The war scare was as real as it gets.""Dr. Voss and the Wingers knew of the story but not of the document until it was made public.According to the Feb. 15, 1990, analysis by the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, ""In 1983 we may have inadvertently placed our relations with the Soviet Union on a hair trigger.""The fact that the Warsaw Pact's military response to Able Archer was ""unparalleled in scale,"" the board concluded, ""strongly suggests to us that Soviet military leaders may have been seriously concerned that the U.S. would use Able Archer 83 as a cover for launching a real attack"" and that ""some Soviet forces were preparing to pre-empt or counterattack a NATO strike launched under cover of Able Archer.""""This situation could have been extremely dangerous if during the exercise -- perhaps through a series of ill-timed coincidences or because of faulty intelligence -- the Soviets had misperceived U.S. actions as preparations for a real attack,"" the report said.While the Soviets were transporting nuclear weapons to launchers and assigning priority targets, NATO commanders appeared to be either oblivious to the apprehension in Moscow -- already jittery over the Reagan administration's Star Wars missile defense initiative, the deployment of American Pershing II missiles in Europe and the incapacitation by illness of much of the aging Soviet leadership -- or discounted it.In ""Deutschland 83,"" an East German spy who has infiltrated the alliance command reveals himself to avert a war. In reality, Lt. Gen. Leonard H. Perroots, deputy chief of staff for intelligence of American Air Forces in Europe, made what the advisory board described as a ""fortuitous, if ill-informed"" decision not to respond to signs of the elevated Soviet military alert.""Really scary,"" the board's report quoted President Ronald Reagan as saying in June 1984 after he read ""a rather stunning array of indicators"" of Soviet aggressiveness in the wake of Able Archer compiled by his C.I.A. director, William J. Casey.The advisory board's heavily redacted 94-page report was made public last month, 11 years after the National Security Archive at George Washington University, a nongovernmental group that focuses on transparency, asked that it be declassified.""This new report is the first all-source assessment, as of 1990, and should clinch the debate: This is hugely important. This war scare was real,"" said Thomas S. Blanton, the archive director. ""Turns out, 1983 is a classic, like the Cuban missile crisis, where neither superpower intended to go nuclear, but the risk of inadvertence, miscalculation, misperception were just really high. Cuba led J.F.K. to the test ban. Nineteen eighty-three led Reagan to Reykjavik and almost to abolition.""The document came to light as tensions between Washington and Moscow have again escalated.""Deutschland 83"" debuted in the United States in June and will be shown in Germany later this month.""Whenever you are writing about history, you're really writing about the present as well,"" Ms. Winger said. ""I'm not sure we meant the story as a warning, exactly, but certainly we wanted to make people think about all these things. We always imagine history is created by a massive groundswell of choreography, but at the end of the day an individual has to make decisions.""The Russians were making their decisions, in part, by feeding 40,000 variables into a computer to predict the likelihood of nuclear attack.""Soviet intelligence clearly had tipoffs"" to the Able Archer exercise, the advisory board's report said, and some scenarios suggested a nuclear first strike.""It is an especially grave error to assume that since we know the U.S. is not going to start World War III,"" the board warned, ""the next leaders of the Kremlin will also believe that -- and act on that belief.""",1.0
Hospital Strike Fueled by Units New to Kunduz:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- The American airstrike against a Doctors Without Borders hospital in northern Afghanistan that killed at least 22 staff members and patients was approved by American Special Operations Forces.The Afghan commandos who requested the strike had been rushed from another part of the country to help quell the Taliban attack. And the AC-130 gunship that unleashed the fire had not worked with either group before.Military investigators have not yet reached any final conclusions about how the Oct. 3 attack in Kunduz occurred, but an emerging focus of investigators is how the lack of familiarity of American and Afghan forces with the area and their lack of experience in working together may have directly contributed to the series of mistaken decisions that led to the attack, American officials said. They attributed those problems, in part, to the withdrawal of American forces from northern Afghanistan that has been part of the gradual drawdown of United States forces in the country.""The Afghan units and U.S. forces did not have much or any time working together,"" one senior Defense Department official said on Tuesday. ""The Kunduz operation was a hasty response, which always increases risk as there is insufficient time for deliberate planning.""Investigators are examining closely what Gen. John F. Campbell, the commander of American forces in Afghanistan, has described as ""a special operations unit that was in close vicinity that was talking to the aircraft that delivered those fires.""Two Pentagon officials said the unit was assigned to the Army's Third Special Forces Group, with headquarters at Fort Bragg, N.C. For most of the war in Afghanistan, the Third Group and the Seventh Group, have done the lion's share of Green Beret missions in Afghanistan but have not typically operated in the city of Kunduz, military officials said.Third Group soldiers have regularly rotated Green Beret teams into Afghanistan and thus have expertise in languages, cultures and customs of the region-- but their operations have typically been in more rural areas than urban centers, the officials said.While the First Group has rotated Green Beret teams into Afghanistan before, its historical mission -- geographically, as well as its expertise in languages, cultures and customs -- has been other parts of Asia.A spokesman for allied forces in Afghanistan, Col. Brian Tribus, declined to give any details about the Special Forces units in Afghanistan, citing the investigations.Also under scrutiny is the role of the Afghan troops who requested the airstrike after coming under hostile fire. A senior Afghan security official said the Afghan troops were a rapid-reaction commando force that had arrived in Kunduz just days before the airstrike.The commandos, who were dispatched from Kabul on Sept. 29, the day after Kunduz fell to the Taliban, would not have been very familiar with the terrain, the official said.Finally, investigators are interviewing the crew of the AC-130 gunship, and reviewing transcripts of the audiotapes between the aircrew and the Americans on the ground approving the strike, as well as gun-camera video of the strike itself.But no evidence has yet emerged that the Afghan troops who called in the strike were under fire from the hospital, said the senior Afghan security official, who works closely with American forces.The results of the first of three inquiries into the attack on the Doctors Without Borders hospital will most likely be released later this week, Pentagon officials said on Tuesday. That inquiry, conducted by NATO officers, is to determine whether civilians were killed, something that all sides quickly agreed did occur. But it may offer new insights into events leading up to the strike.American officials now acknowledge, for instance, that the hospital was on a ""protected list"" of specially designated buildings like mosques or schools, to avoid the very kind of strike that happened. But investigators are still trying to determine why the Afghans, the American Special Forces and the gunship crew apparently were not aware of that.Other factors most likely contributing to the airstrike have previously emerged. General Campbell, according to military officials, believes that United States troops probably did not follow their own rules in calling in the airstrike when no American and Afghan troops were in extreme danger, according to officials with direct knowledge of the general's thinking.Under the rules, airstrikes are authorized to kill terrorists, protect American troops and help Afghans who request support in battles -- like those in Kunduz -- that can change the military landscape. The idea is to give troops leeway, but keep Americans out of daily, open-ended combat.The Special Operations Forces most likely did not meet any of the criteria, General Campbell has said in private discussions, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter has resisted making any judgments on specific American culpability pending the outcome in the next few weeks of an investigation led by an Army officer, Brig. Gen. Richard Kim, who reports to General Campbell.""If there are people who need to be held accountable, they need to be held accountable on the basis of those facts,"" Mr. Carter said earlier this month.General Campbell has already accepted blame for the attack, and the Pentagon has said the military will be authorized to make condolence payments to the families of the civilians killed, and to pay for repairs to rebuild the hospital.Since the strike, a number of Afghan officials, including Masoom Stanekzai, the acting defense minister, have publicly claimed that the Taliban were fighting from the hospital, and that the insurgents were storing heavy weapons there. There has also been talk of operatives from Pakistan's main spy agency, the Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence, using the hospital as a base from which to help direct Taliban fighters in Kunduz.But the Aghan security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid directly contradicting other officials, dismissed all those claims as ""unfounded -- there is no hard evidence.""The hospital had treated many wounded Taliban fighters over the years, and some may have been there at the time of the strike. But ""they were not fighting right then,"" the official said.The official said that many in the Afghan government were desperate to clear the Americans of any wrongdoing in the attack. They were fearful that the fallout from the strike would lead President Obama to place even tighter limits on American troops in Afghanistan, and leave Afghan forces without the backing they need to keep the Taliban at bay throughout Afghanistan.The officials pointed to the Afghan investigation into the attack, which they said was part of a broader inquiry into the fall of Kunduz, and was being led by two former officials who at times have close relationships with the American-led coalition.But, the security official said, ""right now, it does not look like this attack can be blamed on the Taliban.""",1.0
U.S. and Iraqi Forces Take Offensive Against Islamic State on Several Fronts:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BAGHDAD -- Struggling to regain the initiative after a long impasse in the battle against Islamic State militants, the Iraqi government and the American-led coalition are for the first time in months putting military pressure on the jihadists on multiple fronts, officials say.Supported by increased American air power, Iraqi forces are on the outskirts of Ramadi, pressing to encircle the capital of Anbar Province, which the militants took in May, and cut it off from resupply and reinforcements.To the north of Baghdad, Iraqi military forces and Iranian-backed Shiite militias are trying to expand their foothold at the Baiji oil refinery after retaking it from the Islamic State on Friday.And in northeast Syria, the American military last week said it had parachuted 50 tons of ammunition to Syrian Arab fighters. The intent was that those fighters would join a larger body of Kurdish forces in advancing toward Raqqa, the Islamic State's capital in Syria, and perhaps draw some Islamic State fighters away from Iraq to defend the city.""We are doing what you always try to do to the enemy and that is force him to fight in more than one direction at the same time,"" said Lt. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who last month became the American commander for the effort in Iraq and Syria. He had previously served in Iraq as a brigade commander who worked with the Sunni tribes in Anbar Province.The campaign that General MacFarland inherited is not on the timetable originally envisioned. The United States Central Command, which oversees American operations in the Middle East, had once hoped that Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, would be in the Iraqi government's hands by now.Instead, the American-led coalition has found itself trying to jump-start a counteroffensive against the Islamic State in a region in which the Russians and Iranians are asserting themselves in neighboring Syria, and Shiite militias remain a potent political force in Iraq. At the same time, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq has been struggling to build up his authority.Even as the Iraqis have moved on the offensive, they face formidable challenges. Ramadi, for example, is defended by 600 or more militants who have fortified their positions and are still able to sneak fighters to the city on the Euphrates River.And even if the Iraqis succeed in evicting the Islamic State from many of their strongholds, holding them will be a challenge. While Iraqi tribes can help secure some towns and cities, Iraqi provincial police are also supposed to play an important role. But the training of those police forces is just in the early phases: So far, a small team of Italian Carabinieri has trained just 246 police officers, about half of whom are federal police, officials said.But after a long lull, partly imposed by scorching heat and Muslim holidays, the Iraqis and their partners are trying to put the militants on the defensive and force them out of some long-held bastions into the open where they can be more readily targeted by airstrikes, Iraqi officials said.The aim, Iraq's defense minister, Khaled al-Obeidi, said in an interview, is ""to busy the enemy on different axes.""As described by American officials and their allies, the overall strategy is less a product of clockwork synchronization than taking advantage of opportunities that have arisen in recent weeks.The first step to speed up the Ramadi offensive was taken in late August when Mr. Abadi appointed a new head of the Anbar Operations Command, Maj. Gen. Ismail Mahalawi, who he hoped would be more aggressive than his predecessor, who had been wounded in a mortar attack.Some 10,000 Iraqi troops have been trying to isolate the city, advancing from the north, west, south and southeast. One of their key objectives is a bridge that spans the Euphrates northwest of the city, which Iraqi forces want to take in order to stop the Islamic State from using the river to bring in reinforcements.For the first time, Iraqi F-16 warplanes with pilots trained in the Arizona desert have joined other allied warplanes in carrying out airstrikes to support Iraqi ground troops, officials said.The Islamic State fighters holding Ramadi, American officials say, are accomplished in combining terrorist tactics, like the use of suicide car bombs, with more conventional military tactics like rigging houses with explosive traps and packing stretches of road with explosives and then covering the areas with mortar and sniper fire.To help the Iraqi military forge a path through the fortifications, the United States is providing the Iraqi forces with armored bulldozers and mine-clearing devices in which a cable festooned with explosives is fired across the battlefield and then detonated.Progress has been slow despite increased supporting fire from American air operations -- about 70 strikes in the past two weeks, according to the Pentagon. An Iraqi unit advanced to an apartment complex on the southern fringe of the city in recent days only to withdraw after the militants counterattacked.While Iraqi soldiers have been edging toward Ramadi, about 5,000 Iraqi soldiers and national police officers, along with around 10,000 Shiite militia fighters, have been mounting a parallel push in and around the Baiji refinery. Militants are still being pursued in the nearby town of Baiji, where some neighborhoods have been battered by artillery and airstrikes and many electrical cables have been severed.The refinery itself, a sprawling installation that has changed hands several times in fighting over the past year, has been so damaged it will probably take years to restore it to full use, officials say. But it is still considered an important installation, and its location is strategically vital: Control of the surrounding area would provide a potential steppingstone for any eventual Iraqi offensive against the Islamic State in the northern province of Nineveh, where the militants control the major city of Mosul.Long-term control of Baiji would also improve the security of the two major Iraqi cities to the south -- Tikrit and Samarra -- and would curtail access to a major road to the southwest that the Islamic State has been using to funnel fighters from Mosul to Anbar.The Baiji offensive is being overseen by Maj. Gen. Juma al-Jubouri, from the Iraqi military's command center in Salahuddin.But Iraq and the American-led coalition are not the only ones who have a stake in the success. So important is this juncture of the campaign that Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the head of Iran's paramilitary Quds Force, arrived on the scene last week, apparently to help guide some of the Shiite militias that Iran has been supporting, American officials said.The Baiji offensive is a critical one for Mr. Abadi, who is facing internal political pressures within his Shiite coalition to show some progress and who is dealing with militias who have a mind of their own. Officials say allowing the militias to take a major role in that fight eases some of those tensions and also routes most of the militias away from the Ramadi offensive, where a major presence of the irregular forces might alienate the mostly Sunni population or lead to sectarian abuses.The Iraqi government's reliance on militia forces there is also partly a reflection of how efforts to train and equip army units, which American officials believe should conduct the main counteroffensive against the Islamic State, have lagged behind goals set last year. That objective was to train 12 brigades, but the readjusted goal is eight, officials said: six Iraq Army brigades and two Kurdish ones.Still, the participation of the militias is a sensitive issue for the United States, which has made clear that it will conduct airstrikes only to support Iraqi government forces.At the Americans' insistence, Iraq's counterterrorism services, the federal police and the Iraq Army were given the lead in the Baiji operation. But the Shiite militia fighters have clearly benefited from the weeks of United States bombing.""Look, we're trying to do this cleanly,"" said one senior American officer in Washington, meaning supporting only Iraq forces, not the Iranian-trained militias, ""but in Iraq, it's just never that clean.""",1.0
Qaeda Cell Leader Killed in Drone Strike in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- A military airstrike in northwest Syria has killed the leader of a shadowy Qaeda cell that American officials say has been plotting attacks against the United States and Europe, the Pentagon announced on Sunday.The leader, Sanafi al-Nasr, a Saudi citizen, was the highest-ranking leader of a network of about two dozen veteran Qaeda operatives called the Khorasan Group, and the fifth senior member of the group to be killed in the past four months. His death was announced in a Pentagon statement describing Thursday's operation, which American officials said was a drone strike.The American use of drones, as opposed to piloted aircraft, to carry out such strikes may reduce the stakes of any inadvertent confrontation with Russian planes over Syria. For nearly three weeks, Russia has carried out strikes in support of the embattled Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, including some that have killed American-trained Syrian rebels. But last week's successful drone strike is not expected to resolve a continuing policy debate over the long-term success of targeting individual terrorist leaders.The dead Khorasan leader, whose full name was Abdul Mohsen Abdallah Ibrahim al Charekh, was a longtime militant experienced in funneling money and fighters for Al Qaeda, said Peter Cook, the Pentagon press secretary.The statement from Mr. Cook said Mr. Nasr had organized and maintained routes for new recruits to travel from Pakistan to Syria through Turkey, in addition to helping Al Qaeda's external operations in the West. Mr. Nasr previously worked for Al Qaeda's Iran-based facilitation network and, in 2012, he took charge of the group's core finances before relocating to Syria in 2013.In imposing terrorism sanctions on Mr. Nasr last year, the Treasury Department said he had raised money and facilitated travel to Syria for the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria.""Al-Nasr is important as a financier for Al Qaeda with key connections in the Gulf states,"" said Bruce O. Riedel, a former C.I.A. analyst who is now at the Brookings Institution.Last week's strike was another significant blow to the Khorasan network, American terrorism officials said. In early July, the group's founding leader, Muhsin al-Fadhli, was killed while traveling in a vehicle near Sarmada, in northwestern Syria. Mr. Fadhli was a senior Qaeda operative who, according to the State Department, was so close to Osama bin Laden that he was among a small group of people who knew about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks before they were launched.Also in July, David Drugeon, a French citizen and an explosives expert for Khorasan, was killed in an allied airstrike near Aleppo, Syria.As the United States has shifted its main counterterrorism focus to the Islamic State from Al Qaeda, intelligence officials say the Khorasan Group has emerged as the cell in Syria that may be the most intent on, and capable of, striking the United States or its Western allies with an organized terrorist attack.Matthew G. Olsen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said the succession of strikes against Khorasan had significantly hurt its ability to plot attacks.""It seem plausible that the deaths of so many of these guys in Syria over the past year has really degraded the Khorasan Group as a whole,"" Mr. Olsen said. The American effort has also helped prevent Al Qaeda from taking advantage of the chaos in Syria to find space in which to operate, he said.There is little public information about the Khorasan Group, which American officials say is made up of about two dozen seasoned Qaeda operatives from the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa who were sent to Syria by Ayman al-Zawahri, Al Qaeda's leader who is believed to be in Pakistan. Embedded within the Nusra Front, the Khorasan operatives were to recruit Europeans and Americans whose passports allow them to travel on American-bound jetliners with less scrutiny from security officials.Micah Zenko, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, said experts inside and outside the government were divided over the long-term efficacy of a so-called decapitation strategy, in which a terrorist group's leaders are killed.""There's a pretty vigorous debate within the security community about whether this works,"" Mr. Zenko said. Some officials believe that the fear of strikes makes it harder for extremists to meet and communicate and that killing leaders means advancing less competent operatives.But Mr. Zenko said he was among the skeptics. The decapitation approach, he said, really becomes a ""recapitation"" strategy because the targeted groups learn to anticipate the deaths of leaders and prepare deputies to succeed them. Any disruption tends to be temporary, he said.He noted that American officials thought the coalition fighting the Islamic State extremists had killed about 20,000 fighters, but that estimates of the size of the existing fighting force had barely changed. ""They're just replenishing, either with recruits from within Syria and Iraq or with foreign fighters,"" he said.Some American officials believe, however, that as a small, specialized force specifically focused on attacks against the West, the Khorasan Group is more susceptible to disruption by strikes than either the Islamic State or the Nusra Front.",1.0
World Briefing | Europe; Turkey: Jets Shoot Down a Drone:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Turkish fighter jets shot down a drone aircraft close to the Syrian border on Friday after it violated Turkey's airspace, the military said in a statement.""An aerial vehicle of unknown origin was detected inside our airspace on the Syrian border,"" the statement said, adding, ""Our aircraft on patrol mission on the border fired and shot down the vehicle within the rules of engagement.""Since Russia began its military intervention in Syria on Sept. 30 with a series of airstrikes, Turkey has complained several times of incursions by Russian aircraft into its airspace. The Russians have said that the incursions were unintentional, but NATO, of which Turkey is a member, has moved to bolster the alliance's defenses.News agencies in Russia reported on Friday that the aircraft was not Russian. However, Reuters quoted an anonymous United States official as saying that American officials suspected that it was Russian.In Moscow, the Defense Ministry said that all of its warplanes operating in Syria had returned safely to base and that its drones were conducting aerial reconnaissance ""as usual.""""All airplanes of the Russian aviation group in the Syrian Arab Republic have returned to the Hmeimim air base after accomplishing their combat tasks,"" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Defense Ministry spokesman, told reporters on Friday, according to the Interfax news agency.Turkey has in the past brought down several drones operated by the Syrian Air Force, which is loyal to the country's embattled president, Bashar al-Assad.The last time Turkey shot down an aircraft on its border with Syria was in May, when the military claimed that a Syrian warplane had violated its airspace in the eastern region of Hatay. Syrian state television said the Turkish fighter jets had shot down a drone.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
Aid Group Sets Inquiry Into Strike on Hospital:   [Foreign Desk ],,"PARIS -- The aid group Doctors Without Borders said on Wednesday that an independent investigation into the American military airstrike that gutted the group's trauma hospital in the northern Afghan city of Kunduz on Oct. 3 would begin pending the agreement of the United States and Afghan governments.The group called for the investigation, to be conducted by the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission, after criticizing the shifting accounts of the strike by American officials in the days after the attack. At least 22 people were killed, including 12 of the group's staff members.""We have received apologies and condolences, but this is not enough. We are still in the dark about why a well-known hospital full of patients and medical staff was repeatedly bombarded for more than an hour,"" said Dr. Joanne Liu, the president of Doctors Without Borders, a French-based group also known as Médecins Sans Frontières. ""We need to understand what happened and why.""In Kunduz, as fighting ebbed after the withdrawal of Taliban fighters from the city center, images of the hospital showed extensive wreckage. Doctors Without Borders said in a statement that the hospital's destruction had left tens of thousands of people without access to emergency care after weeks of intense fighting for the city.The United States military and the Afghan government have said that they will conduct investigations into the airstrike, but no details from those processes have been released yet.""Even behind a mistake, there is still a potential violation of humanitarian law that may amount to a war crime,"" said Françoise Bouchet-Saulnier, a legal director with Doctors Without Borders.The International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission was established under the Additional Protocols of the Geneva Conventions to investigate humanitarian violations, according to the group. The Doctors Without Borders statement said the commission had sent letters to the governments of Afghanistan and the United States on Wednesday seeking cooperation and was awaiting their response to go ahead with its inquiry.Photograph The Aftermath of the United States Airstrike On the Doctors Without Borders Hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, Which Killed at Least 22 People.

Russian-Made Missile Brought Down Airliner:   [Foreign Desk ],,"PARIS -- A 15-month inquiry into the disintegration of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in the skies over eastern Ukraine has concluded that the aircraft was struck by a Russian-made missile, Dutch air accident investigators said Tuesday.The findings -- based in part on a distinctive shrapnel pattern that was found in the cockpit, near where the missile hit -- come from a five-nation investigative team that retrieved and sifted through several tons of debris and human remains and even reconstructed the aircraft as part of its study.""Flight MH17 crashed as a result of the detonation of a warhead outside the airplane above the left-hand side of the cockpit,"" said Tjibbe Joustra, chairman of the Dutch Safety Board, using a common reference to the flight number. The explosion tore off the forward part of the plane, which broke up in the air. The crash killed all 298 people aboard; the investigation found that many died instantly, while others quickly lost consciousness. ""It is likely that the occupants were barely able to comprehend their situation,"" the board found.While the findings stop short of assigning responsibility for the crash, a task that has been left to Dutch prosecutors, they appear consistent with a theory widely promoted by the authorities in the United States and Ukraine: that the plane, a Boeing 777, was shot down by Russian-backed separatists armed with an SA-11, or Buk, surface-to-air missile launcher.Russia has vehemently disputed that theory, and it continued to do so Tuesday with a competing presentation, saying that the missile must have been fired from Ukrainian-held territory, and that it was of a type that is no longer found in Russia's arsenal.The report on the July 17, 2014, crash was presented at the Gilze-Rijen Air Base in the Netherlands. The 283 passengers and 15 crew members on the flight, which was en route to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from Amsterdam, came from about a dozen countries; 193 of the passengers were Dutch.The board was sharply critical of the Ukrainian authorities for failing to close the airspace above the conflict zone. It found that 160 civil aviation flights went through on the day of the crash before the airspace was closed.""Why was Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 flying over an area where an armed conflict was taking place?"" Mr. Joustra asked. ""The question was on the minds of many people after the crash. The answer was as straightforward as it is disquieting: Almost all operators were flying over that area. And why? Because nobody thought that civil aviation was at risk.""There was sufficient reason to close the airspace as a precaution, but ""the Ukrainian authorities failed to do so,"" he said.The Ukrainian foreign minister, Pavlo Klimkin, told reporters at a press briefing at the United Nations that his country wanted a criminal investigation to ""expose perpetrators."" Asked why Ukraine had not closed its airspace, Mr. Klimkin said the Ukrainian authorities had been unaware that antiaircraft weapons were being used in the area.The report is unlikely to produce consensus. Based on the impact pattern, the impact angle and other data, the Dutch board concluded that the missile originated in an area of about 123 square miles in eastern Ukraine. But Russian experts say the area must be smaller, and Ukrainian experts say it was smaller still.The team of investigators was led by the Netherlands but included members from four other countries heavily affected by the crash: Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine.While the new report was not surprising -- and is consistent with preliminary findings the safety board released a year ago -- it is likely to increase geopolitical pressure on Russia. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in arming separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine or the shooting down of the Malaysia Airlines flight.Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia, which had 43 citizens on the plane, said Tuesday, ""We now know that the plane was hit by a Russian-made Buk missile fired from rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine.""He urged ""the strongest action possible against those responsible"" and promised that ""Malaysia will remain steadfast until those behind this heinous act are made to pay for their crimes.""Ukraine's prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, was more blunt in assigning blame, accusing the Russians. ""Our experts and specialists carried out dozens of tests that will also be made public,"" Mr. Yatsenyuk told a government meeting Tuesday before the Dutch report's publication.""We are convinced it was carried out solely from territory controlled by pro-Russian fighters,"" he said. ""And there is no doubt that drunken separatists are not able to operate Buk systems, and this means these systems were operated solely by professional Russian soldiers.""In addition to studying the causes of the crash, the Dutch report examined the delay in confirming the identities of those onboard -- in some cases, relatives waited as long as 14 days to get confirmation -- and shortcomings in the systems that governments have in place for communicating risks to commercial airliners when flying over conflict zones.While the new report was not intended to assign blame, the Dutch board made public a telltale detail: Investigators had discovered tiny pieces of shrapnel in a distinctive shape, which has been compared to a butterfly, a bowtie or an hourglass.The board said it had extracted butterfly-shaped shrapnel from the body of a pilot, allowing investigators to identify the type of warhead used: 9N314M, a model used to arm two common variants of the Buk, the 9M38 and the 9M38-M1.The 9N314M shrapnel pattern is now very much at the core of the debate over who is to blame for shooting down the plane.Throughout the summer -- as the approach of the report neared -- the company that makes the Buk missile system, Almaz-Antey, asserted that no evidence had been found at the crash site in Ukraine of shrapnel of this shape, which they described as an ""I-beam"" form.On Tuesday, the company said that, as an experiment, it had detonated the type of warhead the Dutch safety board said had brought down the airplane, the 9N314M, beside a decommissioned Il-86 airplane. The intent, it said, was to demonstrate that if such a warhead were used, many bowtie-shaped pieces of shrapnel would lodge in the debris.In fact, this is exactly what the Dutch board said it had discovered in the bodies of the cockpit crew.Analysts said that both Buk variants could be found in Russian and Ukrainian arsenals, although Russia insists that they were withdrawn from active service several years ago.""This is not true,"" Nick de Larrinaga, the European editor of IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, said Tuesday when asked about the Russian claims. He said that both Buk types and their launchers had been on display during Russian military parades and exercises in recent years.""It's possible that they could have been withdrawn from front-line service, but they could still be in reserve service,"" Mr. de Larrinaga said in a telephone interview from London. He added that a significant amount of older Russian military hardware had made its way to the battlefield during the Ukrainian conflict.Mr. de Larrinaga said that while the Dutch findings did not make it possible to categorically rule out the possibility that the missile that hit Flight 17 might have been of Ukrainian origin, he said other elements of the investigation pointed ""conclusively"" to the scenario that the plane was shot down by pro-Russian separatists.

U.S. Tells Asian Allies That Navy Will Patrol Near Disputed Islands:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIJING -- The United States has been briefing its allies in Asia on plans to conduct naval patrols near artificial islands built by China in the disputed South China Sea, a move that could escalate tensions with Beijing after President Xi Jinping's recent visit to Washington, American and Asian officials have said.The ""freedom of navigation"" patrols, which would come within 12 nautical miles of at least one of the islands, are intended to challenge China's efforts to claim large parts of the strategic waterway by enlarging rocks and submerged reefs into islands big enough for military airstrips, radar equipment and lodging for soldiers, the officials said.Though China claims much of the South China Sea as sovereign territory, the 12-mile zone around the new islands is particularly delicate because international law says such artificial islands do not have sovereign rights up to the 12-mile limit.The United States has refrained from venturing that close to Chinese-occupied islands in the South China Sea since at least 2012. In May, a United States Navy surveillance plane flew near three of China's five artificial islands but did not go within their 12-mile territorial zones. Chinese Navy radio operators warned the Americans to leave the area.Officials in the Philippines said they had been told of the planned patrols in the last several days, and Senator Antonio F. Trillanes IV, the chairman of the national defense and security committee, said Monday that he welcomed the decision.The United States secretary of defense, Ashton B. Carter, and the secretary of state, John Kerry, were scheduled to discuss the patrols with their counterparts from Australia on Monday and Tuesday in Boston.The head of the United States Pacific Command, Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., whom the White House asked several months ago to offer options for how to respond to the Chinese actions in the South China Sea, was also scheduled to attend the meetings.The senior adviser on China at the National Security Council, Daniel Kritenbrink, told a gathering of American analysts of the region at a meeting in Washington that the White House had decided to proceed with the patrols, according to a participant who requested anonymity to discuss a closed-door briefing.Mr. Kritenbrink did not specify when the patrols would take place, but he suggested that they had been delayed so as not to disrupt Mr. Xi's visit, the participant said.The Obama administration and America's allies in Asia have debated at length how best to respond to China's moves in the South China Sea, with some urging patrols to push back against Beijing, and with others fearful that the Chinese might use the patrols as justification for a further military buildup.The Chinese have indicated that they will respond to American warships entering the 12-mile territorial waters around the artificial islands.""There is no way for us to condone infringement of China's territorial sea and airspace by any country under the pretext of maintaining the freedom of navigation and overflight,"" the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Friday. China is ""severely concerned"" about reports that the United States planned patrols around the artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago, the ministry's spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said. Five other governments also make territorial claims in those waters.During a news conference with President Obama at the White House, Mr. Xi said China had no intention of militarizing islands in the South China Sea. But exactly what Mr. Xi meant was unclear, American officials said, because he had not said anything like that in the private meetings with Mr. Obama and his senior aides.One purpose of the patrols would be to test Mr. Xi's statement, a United States military official said.At the news conference with Mr. Xi, Mr. Obama emphasized the importance of freedom of navigation, saying, ""The United States will continue to sail, fly and operate anywhere that international law allows.""The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea recognizes 12-mile territorial limits on naturally formed islands but does not recognize such limits on submerged reefs that have been built by land reclamation into above-the-waterline islands.The Chinese have recently built five such islands in the Spratly archipelago. On Fiery Cross Reef, they have completed a 10,000-foot runway capable of accommodating fighter jets.The new Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, would be less inclined to support the patrols than his more hawkish predecessor, Tony Abbott, said Hugh White, a defense analyst. Mr. Turnbull called China's island-building ""counterproductive"" before he took office last month, but he is likely to be cautious about confronting China, Mr. White said.In Manila, Mr. Trillanes said the patrols should move ahead. ""It's quite risky, but we need to know right now to what extent China is willing to go in order to defend these newly created islands,"" he said in a telephone interview.Mr. Trillanes said he was not concerned that such a move might increase the likelihood of conflict in the region. ""The United States has done the math, and they wouldn't do this if tensions would escalate beyond what they would expect,"" he said.Albert F. del Rosario, the Philippine secretary of foreign affairs, said the American patrols would help maintain stability in the region.""Failure to challenge false claims of sovereignty would undermine this order and lead China to the false conclusion that its claims are accepted as a fait accompli,"" Mr. del Rosario said in a statement.But other countries have seemed less receptive to the idea of aggressive action by the Americans.In an interview in August, Ng Eng Hen, the Singaporean defense minister, said the United States had a right to protect its interests, but he urged caution. ""It does no good for the region if there are incidents,"" he said.The United States has several options as to what kind of ships to send on the patrols, and the type of vessel will indicate how big a statement it wants to make, said James Hardy, the Asia-Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defense Weekly.A littoral combat ship that works close to shore has been used in the past for such patrols, Mr. Hardy said. The United States could also send an Arleigh Burke class destroyer accompanied by a couple of smaller ships, thus sending a firmer message, he said.The Chinese would also have choices of how to respond, Mr. Hardy said. They could buzz American ships with aircraft or target them with radar, as they have with Japanese vessels in the East China Sea, he said. Other options would include deploying coast guard vessels to shadow the United States Navy ships or using fishing vessels to get in the way of the patrols.",1.0
"As U.S. Escalates Air War on ISIS, Allies Fade Away:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"AL UDEID AIR BASE, Qatar -- As the United States prepares to intensify airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria, the Arab allies who with great fanfare sent warplanes on the initial missions there a year ago have largely vanished from the campaign.The Obama administration heralded the Arab air forces flying side by side with American fighter jets in the campaign's early days as an important show of solidarity against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Daesh. Top commanders like Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, who oversees operations in Syria and Iraq, still laud the Arab countries' contributions to the fight. But as the United States enters a critical phase of the war in Syria, ordering Special Operations troops to support rebel forces and sending two dozen attack planes to Turkey, the air campaign has evolved into a largely American effort.Administration officials had sought to avoid the appearance of another American-dominated war, even as most leaders in the Persian Gulf seem more preoccupied with supporting rebels fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Now, some of those officials note with resignation, the Arab partners have quietly left the United States to run the bulk of the air war in Syria -- not the first time Washington has found allies wanting.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have shifted most of their aircraft to their fight against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Jordan, reacting to the grisly execution of one of its pilots by the Islamic State, and in a show of solidarity with the Saudis, has also diverted combat flights to Yemen. Jets from Bahrain last struck targets in Syria in February, coalition officials said. Qatar is flying patrols over Syria, but its role has been modest.""They've all been busy doing other things, Yemen being the primary draw,"" Lt. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., who leads the air war from a $60 million command center at this sprawling base in Qatar, said of the Arab allies. He added that those allies still fly periodic missions in Syria and allow American jets to use their bases.The United Arab Emirates last carried out strikes in Syria in March; Jordan in August; and Saudi Arabia in September, according to information provided by allied officials last week. But the Arab allies insist they are still playing an essential, if less active, military role in the war.""Jordan's commitment to this fight is unwavering,"" said Dana Zureikat Daoud, a spokeswoman for the Jordanian Embassy in Washington. ""We remain an active partner and contributor to the international coalition, and continue to conduct airstrikes against Daesh targets.""The engagement of Western allies, like France and Australia, has also been limited. They have conducted a smattering of strikes in Syria, but have reserved most of their firepower for Islamic State targets in Iraq. Canada's new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has promised to fulfill his campaign pledge to end Ottawa's role in the air campaign altogether. And none of the Western allies appear eager to join the United States in basing warplanes at Incirlik air base in Turkey, a move that would make it easier to increase strikes against militants in northern Syria and Iraq.So far, eight Arab and Western allies have conducted about 5 percent of the 2,700 airstrikes in Syria, compared with 30 percent of the 5,100 strikes in Iraq, where many NATO partners also fly missions against the Islamic State. But the United States was always likely to fly the majority of the missions in Syria, as it does in Iraq, since its air forces are much larger than those of the Arab states or any forces deployed by Western allies.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter has promised Congress that the air war in Syria will escalate ""with a higher and heavier rate of strikes,"" including more attacks against top Islamic State leaders and oil fields that remain one of the group's main financial lifelines. But the revamped effort is already facing challenges.For the first time since 2007, the United States does not have an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf and will not again until mid-December; the Navy needed time to conduct badly needed repairs on its fleet. The aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and its air wing, responsible for about 10 percent of the daily strikes in Iraq and Syria, left the gulf in early October. France said on Thursday that it would send its only aircraft carrier to the gulf to help fill the gap.General Brown said the coalition could also pick up the slack using land-based American and allied warplanes, including a dozen A-10 ground-attack planes newly deployed to Incirlik air base, and a dozen F-15's on their way there.Incirlik is far more convenient to the fight -- 15 minutes flight time to the Syrian border compared with nearly five hours from Persian Gulf bases -- making it easier to increase the number of planes that can spend more time hunting Islamic State targets. But Australia and most of the European allies are reluctant to leave their bases in the Middle East, despite the shorter flight times.""It's not just as simple as, 'go to Turkey,' "" Gen. John R. Allen, the special American envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State, told Congress last month. ""They've got bilateral relationships in the gulf that are old, and have been cultivated in order for them to deploy.""So while France will still conduct airstrikes in Syria -- it has carried out about 270 strikes in Iraq and Syria over all, though only two so far in eastern Syria, a senior French official said -- it will continue to fly out of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, at least for now. The Australians will continue F/A-18 combat missions over Syria that began on Sept. 11, expanding beyond strikes in Iraq. But they, too, do not want to give up their base in the United Arab Emirates.Britain has talked tough about going after the Islamic State, but unlike France, its actions have not matched its talk. Britain currently flies bombing missions over Iraq and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance flights over Syria.The British defense and foreign secretaries have said they want forces to be able to fight the Islamic State in Syria as well as in Iraq, and that it is absurd to stop planes at a border that the militant group does not recognize, especially since its command centers are in Syria. But stung by Britain's experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan in support of American wars, Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to seek the approval of Parliament before taking any military action in Syria. He has said that he will only press for such a vote if he has ""a clear majority"" in favor, and so far he has failed to find one.The recent election of the hard-left Jeremy Corbyn as the leader of the Labour Party and Russia's military intervention in Syria have made it even less likely that Mr. Cameron will call for a vote.While some Iraqi and Western experts have criticized the pace of the air campaign, General Brown described two broad areas where he expected attacks against the Islamic State to increase in the coming days. First, he said, newly armed Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters would put pressure on Islamic State fighters in and around Raqqa, the group's self-proclaimed capital, forcing them to move from their defensive positions.""When they are active and moving, that increases our activity for strikes,"" said General Brown. ""Daesh presents itself as a target more.""This is what happened in July, when a Kurdish offensive in northeastern Syria yielded about a dozen strikes a day. But some Kurdish fighters ran low on ammunition, bad weather set in at times, and American commanders focused on targets in western Iraq, reducing strikes in Syria last month to just four a day.The general said the campaign would also intensify attacks on a second set of targets -- fixed sites such as oil-production facilities, bomb-making factories and other so-called critical nodes that support the Islamic State's war effort.Shifting more reconnaissance and surveillance planes to Incirlik to linger over targets longer will also help. Last month, American forces dropped bombs on 67 percent of their strike missions, up from about 25 percent a year ago -- a sign there are more targets to hit.""What I want to have,"" General Brown said, ""is a steady of set of strikes that keeps the pressure on Daesh.""",1.0
Turkish Troops Enter Iraq in Pursuit of Kurdish Rebels:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Turkish ground troops entered northern Iraq on Tuesday, seeking to capture Kurdish rebels who had crossed the border after a rebel attack in Turkey over the weekend killed 16 soldiers, a government official in Turkey said.Demonstrators angry over that attack, and a bombing that killed 14 police officers on Tuesday in eastern Turkey, filled streets in Istanbul and elsewhere. Furious crowds attacked newspapers and the offices of a pro-Kurdish political party, the Reuters news agency reported, prompting Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu to appeal for calm.""I invite all my citizens with hearts full of love for the country to calm, embrace one another, and to have confidence in the state,"" he said Tuesday on Twitter.The tensions escalated as the military pursued militants from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K., the government official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with protocol.The operation's size was not immediately clear, but the Dogan news agency, citing military sources, said two battalions had entered northern Iraq.On Monday, Turkish warplanes struck Kurdish insurgent targets in northern Iraq and killed dozens of rebels.P.K.K. rebels were believed to be behind a roadside bombing in Igdir Province that killed 14 police officers on Tuesday, the semiofficial Anadolu Agency reported. Several other police officers were wounded in the assault.In a separate attack on Tuesday, rocket-propelled grenades wounded at least four police officers in Cizre, a southeastern town, the local news media reported.Violence in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern part of Turkey has escalated since the insurgents killed at least 16 soldiers on Sunday, the deadliest attack since the collapse of a two-year cease-fire in July.The Kurdish group, which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, has been attacking Turkish security officials almost daily since the breakdown of the fragile peace process.Turkish officials say the group has killed at least 100 members of the security forces since July.After the attack on Sunday, Mr. Davutoglu vowed to eradicate the fighters from their mountain strongholds in Turkey and northern Iraq. ""These terrorists must be wiped out from the mountains; whatever happens, they must be wiped out,"" he said Monday in the capital, Ankara.""The mountains of this country must not be handed over to terrorists,"" he added. ""Every effort will be undertaken.""The Turkish military then struck 20 Kurdish targets late Monday in northern Iraq, killing at least 35 fighters, Anadolu reported.As the unrest spread to the streets on Monday and Tuesday, nationalist mobs attacked dozens of buildings belonging to the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party. On Tuesday night, a crowd attacked its headquarters in Ankara as well, the party said.Thousands of people took to the streets across Turkey to protest the attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party and call for peace.The Peoples' Democratic Party won representation in Parliament for the first time in a June 7 election by passing a 10 percent threshold, a factor in the governing Justice and Development Party's loss of its parliamentary majority for the first time in more than a decade.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"Close to 8,000 Have Been Killed in Ukraine Conflict, United Nations Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"GENEVA -- Nearly 8,000 people have died in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the United Nations said Tuesday in a report blaming the continuing influx of fighters and weaponry from Russia as the major obstacle to peace.At least 7,962 people have been killed and 17,811 wounded in the fighting that erupted in April 2014, the United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, said in a statement issued with the latest report by his agency's monitors in Ukraine.They said more than 400 civilians had been killed or wounded in artillery exchanges in the three most recent months covered by the report, more than double the number in the preceding three months, and cited daily violations of the cease-fire accord negotiated in February in Minsk, Belarus, between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian groups controlling large portions of eastern Ukraine.""The major impediments"" to peace are the presence of foreign fighters, the flow of sophisticated and heavy weaponry from Russia, and Ukraine's lack of control over its eastern border with Russia, the report said.The report, covering the months up to Aug. 15, was issued as the Ukrainian and Russian authorities described a downturn in fighting since a new truce began at the start of September.A Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters in Moscow that there was ""practically no shelling"" of civilian areas in the east by Ukrainian forces, while the Ukrainian defense minister, Col. Gen. Stepan Poltorak, said attacks on Ukrainian forces were down to two to four daily, the lowest level in a year and a half, the news media reported.However, Mr. Peskov added that there had been no progress on other aspects of the Minsk accord, which also calls for greater autonomy for eastern Ukraine and amnesty for fighters.United Nations monitors reported allegations of summary killings by pro-Russian armed groups and of torture, abductions and sexual violence by both sides in the conflict.The United Nations said the Ukrainian authorities were introducing legislation to comply with the Minsk accord, while armed groups controlling areas around Donetsk and Luhansk were setting up law enforcement, judicial and legislative bodies and issuing their own passports that did not conform to either international law or Ukrainian legislation.""Implementation of the Minsk agreement is key, and right now what we see is one side trying to do that and others moving away from it,"" Gianni Magazzeni, a senior United Nations human rights official, told reporters in Geneva.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

U.S. Moves to Block Russian Military Buildup in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The United States on Tuesday moved to head off preparations for a suspected Russian military buildup in Syria as Bulgaria agreed to an appeal from the Obama administration to shut its airspace to Russian transport planes. The planes' destination was the Syrian port city of Latakia.The administration has also asked Greece to close its airspace to the Russian flights, Greek and American officials said, but Greece has not publicly responded to the request.The apparent Russian military preparations and the Obama administration's attempt to block them have escalated long-running tensions between the White House and the Kremlin. Although the United States and Russia agree that the Islamic State is a threat, the new dispute shows that they remain far apart on how best to combat the militant group and on the political future of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria -- divisions that are likely to be on display when President Obama and President Vladimir V. Putin speak to the United Nations General Assembly this month.The administration's concerns were fueled last week by intelligence reports indicating that Russia appeared to be making preparations to deploy advisers and military personnel to an airfield south of Latakia and might also bring in aircraft and fly airstrikes from there. Those preparations included the delivery of prefabricated housing for as many as 1,000 personnel and a portable air traffic control station to the airfield.Over the weekend, two giant Russian Condor transport planes ferried more supplies and equipment from an air base in southern Russia across Iran and Iraq to Latakia, according to an American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was discussing intelligence reports.A Russian troop transport plane, probably an Ilyushin model, also landed at the same airfield in Latakia over the weekend. That aircraft, which flew over Greece and Bulgaria, is believed to have carried Russian military personnel.""They're clearly establishing some sort of forward operating base,"" the American official said.There have also been unconfirmed sightings of Russian Spetsnaz special forces at the Syrian Naval Academy, officials said.Providing a benign explanation for the operations, the Russian news media has suggested that the planes were carrying humanitarian assistance. That is the same rationale Russia used to explain convoys that are believed to have delivered military supplies to Ukrainian separatists and that Iran has used to fly arms to Damascus to support the Assad government.Bulgarian officials said on Tuesday that they had closed their nation's airspace to Russian transport planes through Sept. 24.""The reason for the refusal is associated with incorrect information in the requests to fly over the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria regarding the purpose of the flights and the cargo,"" Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.While Bulgaria's move will block one of the major air routes from Russia to Greece, it does not fully resolve the issue since Russia may still be able to continue its flights over Iran and Iraq. There is also a route from Russia to Syria over Turkey, but Russians avoid Turkish airspace because they fear the Turks will force a Russian military plane to land, as they have in the past.State Department officials declined to discuss publicly what requests have been made to foreign governments to close their airspace to Russian aircraft, citing the need to maintain the confidentiality of diplomatic communications. But the officials made clear they were pressing the issue.""We have encouraged our allies and partners to ask tough questions of Russia's increased military deployments to Syria,"" said John Kirby, the State Department spokesman.At the least, the flights have highlighted the deepening differences between the United States and Russia over Syria. While the Obama administration has argued that Mr. Assad's brutal crackdown against his opponents fueled the sectarian passions that strengthened the Islamic State, the Russians still appear to see the Syrian president as a bulwark against extremists, at least for now.Western officials say that Russia's intentions are not entirely clear. Although Mr. Putin spoke in Vladivostok last week about the need to form a coalition against the Islamic State, Iran and the Syrian government appear to be the only potential members so far.One possibility is that Russia is not only trying to support the Syrian government but is trying to expand its role inside Syria so it can influence the choice of a new Syrian government in case Mr. Assad is ousted. Another theory is that Russia is putting itself in a position to defend a rump state should Mr. Assad be driven from Damascus and find refuge in a stronghold near the coast. None of these possibilities are mutually exclusive.On Saturday Mr. Kerry called Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and warned Russia not to expand its military role in Syria. On Monday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lavrov said that the Kremlin had long provided military assistance to the Syrian government in its fight against extremists and expressed surprise at Mr. Kerry's warning.But on Tuesday, Mr. Kirby repeated the criticism of Russia's role.""Russia is not a member of the coalition against ISIL, and what we've said is that their continued support to the Assad regime has actually fostered the growth of ISIL inside Syria and made the situation worse,"" he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State. ""If they want to be helpful against ISIL, the way to do it is to stop arming and assisting and supporting Bashar al-Assad.""Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"After Fatal Attack, Turkey Strikes at Kurdish Rebels:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"ISTANBUL -- The Turkish military carried out airstrikes against Kurdish insurgents on Monday, a day after what appeared to be the deadliest rebel assault since the breakdown in July of a fragile peace process with the Turkish state.The death toll from Sunday's attack was not clear. The military put the figure at 16, with six more wounded, but a website close to the Kurdistan Workers' Party said that 31 soldiers had been killed. Turkish fighter jets struck 23 targets in retaliation, the military said.The clashes signaled an escalation in violence in Turkey's southeast, where Kurdish militants have resumed an insurgency against the Turkish state that has claimed nearly 40,000 lives over three decades.On Monday, the military said it had launched airstrikes on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party in response to the ambush by militants in the Daglica area of Hakkari Province, close to the border with Iraq. There were no immediate reports of deaths.The airstrikes came after two armored vehicles suffered heavy damage on Sunday from handmade explosives, the military said in a statement, which noted ""martyrs and wounded among our heroic armed comrades.""Government officials said that more than 70 members of the Turkish security forces had been killed since the end of a cease-fire in July. In response to the daily attacks by the Kurdish militants, Turkish officials have called on the Kurdistan Workers' Party leadership to reinstate the cease-fire and withdraw from Turkey as a first step toward disarmament.In 2013, Turkey reached a historic settlement with the Kurdish militias, vowing to grant the Kurdish minority greater rights and autonomy in exchange for the cease-fire, which brought peace and stability to the volatile southeast.Elections are scheduled for Nov. 1, with Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's Justice and Development Party hoping to regain the majority it lost in a June 7 vote. Opponents say the government's decision to resume extensive military operations against the Kurdistan Workers' Party is driven at least in part by a calculated strategy by the Justice and Development Party to recapture the nationalist vote.Commenting on the unrest in a television interview on Sunday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the situation would be different if Turks had voted for 400 lawmakers from a single party in the June election, referring to the number of seats the Justice and Development Party would need to secure an absolute majority to change the Constitution.He vowed that Turkey would continue its military operations against the Kurdish militants ""until the end."" He said 2,000 militants had been killed so far.After the attack on Sunday, Mr. Davutoglu left early from a soccer match between Turkey and the Netherlands in the city of Konya and returned to Ankara to convene an emergency security meeting. No statements were made.On Monday, Mr. Erdogan said the attack had been aimed at breaking up the country's unity.""I believe that the Turkish nation will maintain a united and determined stance against attacks that aim to damage peace, security and stability of the country,"" he said in a statement.Selahattin Demirtas, co-chairman of the pro-Kurdish Democratic People's Party, whose success in the June election stripped Justice and Development of its majority, condemned the attack and the government's policy toward the Kurds.""As killing has no justification; leading our people to death has no justification either,"" he said on Twitter.

Britain Says First Drone Strike in Syria Hit ISIS Suspects:   [Foreign Desk ],,"LONDON -- Crossing a significant threshold in its battle with jihadist groups, Britain announced on Monday that it had conducted an armed drone strike for the first time inside Syria, killing three suspected members of the Islamic State, including two British citizens.In a statement to Parliament, Prime Minister David Cameron said that a British man, Reyaad Khan, had been identified as a terrorist threat and was killed on Aug. 21 in an operation in which two associates, including another Briton, identified as Ruhul Amin, also died.Mr. Cameron's announcement came as France said it would start sending reconnaissance flights over Syria and was considering airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syrian territory.The British government's decision to order a lethal drone strike against a terrorism suspect in another country -- an action long practiced by the United States -- is a significant step, raising questions about the scope of British operations in the Middle East.Britain is not taking part in military action in Syria, because lawmakers rejected that idea two years ago, although both Britain and France are involved in the American-led campaign to strike Islamic State targets in Iraq.The Aug. 21 strike appeared to bring British policy closer to that of the Americans, who in a 2011 drone strike targeted and killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born jihadist preacher.British officials did not offer a specific explanation for the delay of more than two weeks in reporting the lethal drone operation. Nor did they explain precisely how they knew two of the victims were Britons.""This announcement by the prime minister is a big departure in a number of ways,"" said Michael Clarke, director general of the Royal United Services Institute, a research organization that specializes in defense issues, who noted that Britain had so far promised not to conduct military operations in Syria.In addition, Mr. Clarke said, ""this drone strike is the first to have been conducted, apparently, as a targeted assassination.""Speaking to lawmakers, Mr. Cameron justified the action on the grounds that Mr. Khan, 21, and another Briton, Junaid Hussain, had sought ""to orchestrate specific and barbaric attacks,"" including terrorism in Britain. Mr. Hussain was reported killed in an American drone strike on Aug. 24.Mr. Cameron was vague about the precise threat posed, though he said it included ""directing a number of planned terrorist attacks right here in Britain, such as plots to attack high-profile public commemorations, including those taking place this summer.""Several weeks ago, one British newspaper suggested that the queen might be a terrorism target when she attended the ceremony to commemorate the end of World War II in Japan, though this commemoration took place on the weekend before the lethal British drone strike.Mr. Cameron said six plots by Islamic extremists had been thwarted this year and described the killings as an ""act of self-defense,"" taken after ""meticulous planning.""However, the acting leader of the opposition Labour Party, Harriet Harman, questioned the legality of the strike and urged the government to publish the legal advice, something it said it did not plan to do.The decision to target Mr. Khan was made in the country's National Security Council, at a meeting attended by Mr. Cameron, his office said. Approval for the specific operation that killed Mr. Khan was given by the defense secretary, Michael Fallon.""We took this action because there was no alternative,"" Mr. Cameron told lawmakers. ""In this area, there is no government we can work with.""We have no military on the ground to detain those preparing plots.""Mr. Cameron also said that the British attorney general had been consulted and that Britain was exercising its ""inherent right to self-defense.""His announcement came as diplomatic discussions have intensified over the conflict in Syria, a primary cause of the growing refugee crisis in Europe. Many of the thousands now fleeing for safety in European countries are Syrians.Since its election in May, the British government has been expected to make another attempt to get the approval of lawmakers for military action in Syria.Mr. Clarke said that the drone killings ""will be regarded as jumping the parliamentary gun"" in announcing that British air power had already been used to bomb something on the ground inside Syria, adding that this may prove to be a ""high-risk strategy.""Brendan O'Hara, who speaks for the Scottish National Party on defense, added that ""the case for bombing in Syria has simply not been made -- and any involvement of British service personnel in bombing without the approval of Parliament clearly flouts the democratic decision taken by the House of Commons.""The French decision to at least begin surveillance missions over Syria was announced by President François Hollande at a news conference in Paris.""Depending on the information that we will have gathered, the intelligence that we will have collected and the reconnaissance that we will have done, we will be ready to conduct airstrikes,"" Mr. Hollande said.Sending French troops to Syria was ""unrealistic"" and ""reckless,"" Mr. Hollande said, and he ruled out ordering any ground forces to Syria or Iraq, where he said France had already conducted 200 airstrikes.Asked about reports that Russia was bolstering military support for the government of Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, Mr. Hollande said that Russia was committed to a political solution of the Syria conflict, now in its fifth year.Although Russia is an ally of Syria, Mr. Hollande said, Russia would not offer unwavering support to Mr. Assad himself.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

U.S. to Revamp a Rebel Force Combating ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- In an acknowledgment of severe shortcomings in its effort to create a force of moderate rebels to battle the Islamic State in Syria, the Pentagon is drawing up plans to significantly revamp the program by dropping larger numbers of fighters into safer zones as well as providing better intelligence and improving their combat skills.The proposed changes come after a Syrian affiliate of Al Qaeda attacked, in late July, many of the first 54 Syrian graduates of the military's training program and the rebel unit they came from. A day before the attack, two leaders of the American-backed group and several of its fighters were captured.The encounter revealed several glaring deficiencies in the program, according to classified assessments: The rebels were ill-prepared for an enemy attack and were sent back into Syria in too small numbers. They had no local support from the population and had poor intelligence about their foes. They returned to Syria during the Eid holiday, and many were allowed to go on leave to visit relatives, some in refugee camps in Turkey -- and these movements likely tipped off adversaries to their mission. Others could not return because border crossings were closed.The classified options now circulating at senior levels of the Pentagon include enlarging the size of the groups of trained rebels sent back into Syria, shifting the location of the deployments to ensure local support, and improving intelligence provided to the fighters. No decisions have been made on specific proposals, according to four senior Defense Department and Obama administration officials briefed on the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential planning.""As with any difficult endeavor, we expected setbacks and successes, and we must be realistic with those expectations,"" Capt. Chris Connolly, a spokesman for the American military task force training the Syrian rebels, said in an email. ""We knew this mission was going to be difficult from the very beginning.""The Pentagon effort to salvage its flailing training program in Turkey and Jordan comes as the world is fixated on the plight of thousands of refugees seeking safety in Europe from strife in the Middle East, including many fleeing violence of the Syrian civil war and oppression in areas under the control of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. Officials in Washington and European capitals acknowledge that halting this mass migration requires a comprehensive international effort to bring peace and stability to areas that those refugees are now fleeing.The 54 Syrian fighters supplied by the Syrian opposition group Division 30 were the first group of rebels deployed under a $500 million train-and-equip program authorized by Congress last year. It is an overt program run by United States Special Forces, with help from other allied military trainers, and is separate from a parallel covert program run by the C.I.A.After a year of trying, however, the Pentagon is still struggling to find recruits to fight the Islamic State without also battling the forces of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, their original adversary.The willing few face screening, but it is so stringent that only dozens have been approved from among the thousands who have applied, and they are bit players in the rebellion. The program has not engaged with the biggest, most powerful groups, Islamist factions that are better funded, better equipped and more motivated. Even the program's largest supporters now concede that the goal of generating more than 5,000 trained fighters in the first year of the program is unrealistic.With the White House ruling out sending American advisers into Syria with the trainees, the biggest challenge may be deciding where and how to send the rebels back in.""We don't have direct command and control with those forces once we do finish training and equipping them when we put them back into the fight,"" Brig. Gen. Kevin J. Killea, chief of staff for the American-led military operation fighting the Islamic State, told reporters in a video teleconference at the Pentagon last Friday. ""If I had to point to a place where we could explore better lessons learned, that would be it.""At least one part of the training program worked well: the ability to provide real-time air cover for the rebels once back inside Syria. Predator drones quickly rushed to help the Division 30 fighters once they came under attack from the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, killing dozens of the attackers, American officials said. Nonetheless, Pentagon planners are reviewing their support for rebels both before and after they are sent back to the battlefield, to see how it can be improved.Two Syrian rebel commanders interviewed recently in Turkey with fighters in the United States program described an initiative that had struggled from the start.The group meant to accept the training program's graduates, Division 30, was created from scratch earlier this year, and commanders of mostly small fighting groups from different parts of Syria were asked to submit names of fighters for training.While most of the fighters were Sunni Arabs, Nadim Hassan, an ethnic Turkmen whom few people had heard of before, was named as its leader, a decision many rebels felt had been imposed by the Turkish government.Some commanders were eager to participate. ""It was supposed to be an organized army where no one had benefits over anyone else,"" said Abdul-Razaq Freiji, who had defected from the Syrian Army early in the uprising and led a small fighting group near the central city of Hama. ""We are military men and we like order, so we wanted training and organization.""The trainees were to get good weapons and monthly salaries ranging from $225 for soldiers to $350 for officers, Mr. Freiji said.The participating rebel commanders submitted lists of their fighters for training, but many were surprised by how few were accepted. Mr. Freiji submitted 1,100 names, but only 42 of his men were accepted initially.The number of participants dwindled further after training began. Some recruits were sent home because they had come with fake identification cards, were under 18, or did not give proper answers when asked about the Islamic State, Mr. Freiji said.Trainees learned to use American-issued M16 assault rifles, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. Some were trained as snipers, while others were taught to identify targets for airstrikes by the American-led military coalition that is fighting the Islamic State.On his phone, Mr. Freiji flipped through photos of skinny trainees in clean military uniforms wielding their new weapons. But new problems arose after the class of 54 graduated in July.About a dozen returned to Syria to visit their families and were detained by the Nusra Front, Mr. Freiji said. While some have since been released, the episode emphasized how vulnerable the young recruits were to battle-hardened militants who have now been fighting in Syria for years.Division 30's leaders recognized this, so on July 30, Mr. Hassan, the group's leader, and another commander, Farhan Jassem, entered Syria to meet with Nusra Front leaders and assure them that the American-trained force intended to fight only the Islamic State, according to Mr. Freiji and another Division 30 commander who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize his relationship with the Americans.Soon after entering Syria, the two men and six others were promptly captured by the Nusra Front. They are still being held.The next day, the Nusra Front attacked Division 30's base in the village of Mariameen in northwestern Syria, an effort it said was to stop the American program before it could get a foothold in the country.Mr. Freiji was in Turkey at the time but showed a text chat on his phone with a commander who was inside the base at the time. ""We are surrounded,"" the commander in Syria wrote.Mr. Freiji called his liaison with the Americans and waited. More than two hours later, an American drone struck the Nusra fighters. A black-and-white video on his phone, apparently shot by an American drone, showed dozens of fighters he said were from the Nusra Front approaching the base before a large blast hit them, followed by automatic fire from the sky.A handful of Division 30 fighters were killed in the clash. One trainee was wounded and sent to a hospital, where he disappeared, presumably captured by the jihadists, Mr. Freiji said. Dozens of Nusra fighters were killed in the strikes, ending the battle.That attack threw the effort into disarray, with Division 30 fighters scattered inside of Syria and across the border in Turkey. ""The Americans made the mistake,"" Mr. Freiji said. ""You can't send in a group that small into Syria.""He was still waiting to hear from the Americans how future graduates would be sent into Syria and protected.Mr. Freiji said a number of trained Division 30 fighters recently joined other rebels in Marea, a village north of Aleppo that the Islamic State has been trying to capture for some time. He said the others welcomed the Division 30 fighters because they had been trained to call in coalition airstrikes.The other commander involved with Division 30, who has dozens of fighters currently in training, said that instead of sending his fighters to the front lines to battle the Islamic State, he planned to send them to their original base, where they would be safe until the Americans had a convincing plan to protect them.""We have to work with the reality that exists, not dreams and ideas,"" the commander said.",1.0
Saudi Officials Say 10 Soldiers Slain in Yemen:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- A spokesman for Saudi Arabia's military said Saturday that 10 Saudi soldiers were killed in a rebel missile strike a day earlier in Yemen, raising the death toll from the attack to at least 60.It was the first public acknowledgment by the Saudis that they have ground troops in Yemen, where they are leading a coalition to roll back gains by the Shiite rebels known as Houthis and their allies.The United Arab Emirates said 45 of its soldiers were killed in the attack on Friday, when rebels hit an ammunition depot in Marib Province, about 75 miles east of the capital, Sana. It was the deadliest day for the military in the nation's 44-year history.In a statement, the Saudi spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, said, ""Ten Saudi soldiers from the Arab coalition forces were martyred"" in the attack on the weapons depot.Bahrain, another member of the coalition, said Friday that five of its soldiers also had been killed.The Saudi-led coalition, which is backed by the United States, is made up mainly of Persian Gulf nations. It has been carrying out airstrikes against the rebels since March.Before Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Bahrain confirmed the casualties in the attack in Marib, coalition countries had avoided acknowledging that they had troops in Yemen.Yemeni security officials have said that Saudi, Emirati, Egyptian and Jordanian military advisers are training hundreds of fighters at a military base in Aden. The Saudis are also supplying weapons and providing military advice in the fight for control of Yemen.The rebels and army units loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh are fighting forces loyal to President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who is in self-imposed exile in Saudi Arabia, as well as southern separatists and local militias.Officials from the Houthi news office confirmed that they had fired a missile in Marib, which had been a staging ground for what pro-government forces described as a coming assault on the Houthis' strongholds.",1.0
World Briefing | Europe; Turkey: Troops in Iraq Withdrawn:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Turkey on Monday withdrew some troops that had been sent to the outskirts of Mosul in northern Iraq to support a training mission, a deployment that had set off an angry reaction in Baghdad, where the authorities said they had never agreed to host Turkish forces.Turkey has been training Kurdish pesh merga forces and Sunni Arab fighters -- mostly policemen who fled Mosul's capture last year by the Islamic State -- in northern Iraq for nearly a year, but with the permission of only the local Kurdish government, not Baghdad.When Turkey recently sent a new detachment of troops, with armored vehicles and tanks, to a camp in Bashiqa, near Mosul, it set off protests throughout Iraq. Demonstrators burned Turkish flags recently at gatherings in Baghdad and other cities, and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, saying the troops infringed on Iraqi sovereignty, vowed to seek action by the United Nations Security Council to force out the Turkish troops.The episode has highlighted how divided Iraq is, and showed the weakness of the central government and its lack of control over its territory.After talks last week between Turkish and Iraqi leaders, including a visit to Baghdad by Turkey's intelligence chief, many of the Turkish troops who had recently been sent to northern Iraq -- but apparently not all -- were withdrawn on Monday. Turkish officials had said the troops had been sent to protect military trainers from a rising threat of attacks by the Islamic State, and on Monday the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency said some were withdrawn out of ""military necessity.""It was unclear if the withdrawal was enough to defuse tensions with Baghdad, and there was no statement on Monday from Mr. Abadi. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke Monday with Turkey's prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, and a statement issued by the White House said Mr. Biden ""welcomed reports of the withdrawal of Turkish troops out of Camp Bashiqa as an important step to de-escalate recent tensions.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
"Violence Escalates in Yemen as Islamic State Gains Strength, Challenging Al Qaeda:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SANA, Yemen -- Nine months of war between a Saudi-led military coalition and a Yemeni rebel group have left thousands of civilians dead, a nation gravely polarized and the land strewn with debris, mines and unexploded bombs.The conflict has produced another bitter legacy: a new branch of the Islamic State that has quietly grown in strength and appears determined to distinguish itself as Yemen's most disruptive and brutal force, carrying out attacks considered too extreme even by the country's branch of Al Qaeda.The Islamic State's deadliest assaults, on mosques here in the capital, killed more than 130 people and helped start Yemen's civil war in March. In recent weeks, the group has carried out powerful car bombings in southern Yemen and released videos filled with grisly executions and sectarian denunciations of Yemen's Shiite minority. The violence has raised tensions before United Nations-brokered negotiations to end the conflict, scheduled to begin this week in Geneva, as well as a cease-fire announced by the Saudi-led coalition that is set to begin Tuesday.Like Islamic State affiliates in Egypt and Libya, the Yemeni group has shown signs it is more closely coordinating its activities with the headquarters in Syria, analysts said. And its emergence has only added to the peril from Sunni extremism in Yemen, already home to a powerful branch of Al Qaeda that has been able to seize territory during the latest conflict, including Al Mukalla, the country's fifth-largest city.American intelligence and counterterrorism analysts say the Qaeda affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, remains the most urgent militant threat in this fractured country. But they are closely watching the effort by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, to peel off defectors from Al Qaeda's wing here.""The pace of its attacks and declarations of new provinces during the past year underscores the group's ambitions in Yemen,"" said an American counterterrorism official, referring to the Islamic State. ""While some may not consider ISIL's Yemen affiliate to be as worrying as the group's other hubs, there are a number of factors that indicate the branch should be taken seriously in the long term.""An analyst in Yemen who closely follows Sunni extremist groups in the country said the scale of the attacks by the Islamic State showed that it was becoming just as dangerous as Al Qaeda. At the start of Yemen's civil war, the Islamic State's presence was ""limited,"" said the analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the hazards of talking openly about the group.As the war has spread across Yemen and the violence intensifies, the group's ""recruiting circle is expanding,"" he added.The Saudi-led coalition said on Monday that its forces would cease fighting for seven days, beginning on Tuesday, in order to ""create the atmosphere for the success"" of the negotiations in Geneva, according to a statement carried by the official Saudi news agency. Past cease-fires during the war have been marred by violations and frequently led to an escalation of the fighting.Both the Islamic State and Al Qaeda have profited from a security vacuum while trying to rally Yemen's Sunnis against the Shiite-led rebels, known as the Houthis, who are from the north, analysts say. Crucially, the groups have both faced little or no resistance from the Saudi-led coalition and its allies, which are focused on defeating the Houthis. The coalition receives backing from the United States and Britain.This month, Qaeda militants were able to capture two towns in southern Yemen with little effort, residents said. In some cities, including Aden and Taiz, small numbers of hard-line Sunni militants continue to fight alongside the Saudis and their allies.At the same time, Yemeni officials with the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by the Saudi-led coalition, have appeared to underestimate the threat posed by the Islamic State -- or even deny its existence.Last week, when the Islamic State claimed responsibility for killing the provincial governor of Aden and eight of his bodyguards with a car bomb -- releasing both a statement and photographs of the attack -- the city's security director, Mohamed Mousaed, insisted that ""remnants of the Houthis and Saleh"" had carried out the bombing. Yemen's former president Ali Abdullah Saleh is allied with the rebels.Nadwa al-Dawsari, a Yemeni analyst and nonresident fellow at the Project on Middle East Democracy in Washington, said there was a widespread perception in southern Yemen that the threat from the Islamic State was ""manufactured."" That perception was fueled by the group's ""invisibility,"" as well as Mr. Saleh's well-documented history of manipulating extremist groups for his own ends, including to win financial and military support from the United States for counterterrorism operations, she said.But whether the Islamic State has grown organically or not, ""the threat is real and the threat is strong,"" Ms. Dawsari said.The group has sent suicide bombers to attack mosques in Sana, which is controlled by the Houthis. In the past few weeks, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for car bombings in Aden, including an attack on a hotel hosting members of Mr. Hadi's government and another at a headquarters for the Saudi-led coalition.A video released recently by the branch underscored its determination to showcase its brutality. In one section, the video shows masked gunmen leading prisoners to a small boat that was set out to sea and then blown up. Another vignette showed four captives made to wear what appeared to be mortar shells, draped around their necks, then pose for the camera before the shells were detonated.The governor of Aden, Jaafar Mohamed Saad, was the highest-ranking official killed by the group since the emergence of the Islamic State in Yemen about a year ago. The relative ease of the attack showed a failure ""to establish security in the south, despite a huge opportunity,"" Ms. Dawsari said.The Saudi-led coalition sent thousands of troops to drive the Houthis out of Aden and other southern provinces in July. But afterward, a decree issued by Mr. Hadi to integrate local resistance groups into the armed forces was not carried out, Ms. Dawsari said.""The presence of foreign troops hasn't been helpful, except for keeping Saleh and the Houthis from coming back,"" she said. ""Aden does not need foreign troops for security. It needs local security structures and police forces.""The struggles by the coalition to establish security and stem the growth of the militant groups could carry consequences beyond Yemen's borders, according to security analysts.""The assassinations and other violence show that ISIS has gained power,"" said Matthew G. Olsen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington. ""There's real concern that some of the most capable operational terrorists, who are now with A.Q.A.P., could join forces with ISIS and pose a heightened threat to carry out external attacks,"" he said, using an acronym for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.Others said defections from Al Qaeda were already gathering steam. ""There are large numbers of both leaders and individuals joining the Islamic State,"" said a former member of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who has left the group but remains close to its members. Many of the defectors, he said, were hard-line jihadists and young militants frustrated with Al Qaeda's failure to be more aggressive during the current war.But the militants of the Islamic State, he said, ""follow their words with actions.""",1.0
Run-In With Turkish Fishing Boat Angers Russian Military:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- Russia summoned a Turkish military attaché on Sunday to warn of what it called provocations by a Turkish fishing boat near a Russian warship in the Aegean Sea.The warship fired warning shots after the fishing boat did not heed calls to change course when it sailed within about 1,600 feet of the Smetlivy destroyer, one of the ships supporting Russia's military intervention in Syria, the Russian Defense Ministry said.Russia told the Turkish military attaché of ""potentially disastrous consequences from Ankara's reckless actions toward Russia's military contingent fighting against international terrorism in Syria,"" the Defense Ministry said in a statement.It added that ""only by luck was tragedy avoided.""The episode seemed likely to heighten tensions between Russia and Turkey over the Syrian crisis and Turkey's shooting down of a Russian military jet last month. Turkey says Russia's air force is targeting ethnic Turkish villages in northern Syria amid its effort to prop up President Bashar al-Assad.The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, in Rome for talks about Libya, told reporters he did not want relations with Russia to worsen over the episode and said that ""we want to overcome tensions through dialogue.""",1.0
General to Investigate U.S. Airstrike on Doctors Without Borders Hospital:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. KABUL, Afghanistan -- With an initial military assessment confirming civilian casualties in the bombing of a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz by an American warplane, Gen. John F. Campbell, the American commander in Afghanistan, has appointed a two-star general from another command to conduct an independent investigation, his office said in a statement on Saturday.The announcement came as the death toll in the bombing, one of the worst episodes of civilian casualties in the Afghan war, rose once again, three weeks after the AC-130 gunship repeatedly bombed the trauma center in Kunduz after fighting the Taliban, who had overrun the city. Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French name, Médecins Sans Frontières, said the casualty figures now stood at 23 staff members and patients killed and three others missing who are presumed dead.Officials are trying to determine the identities of seven unrecognizable bodies found in the wreck of the hospital, all of whom have now been buried, the organization said in a statement on Saturday. The three missing people could be among them.A spokesman for General Campbell, Brig. Gen. Wilson Shoffner, said an assessment team had ""determined that the reports of civilian casualties were credible."" The investigation, which will be conducted by three senior officers outside General Campbell's command, will be led by Maj. Gen. William B. Hickman and supported by two brigadier generals.General Campbell, also the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, said: ""My intent is to disclose the findings of the investigation once it is complete. We will be forthright and transparent and we will hold ourselves accountable for any mistakes made.""But Doctors Without Borders sees the episode as a possible war crime, and neither the Pentagon's announcement that it would investigate nor an earlier apology from President Obama seems to have deterred the group's insistence on an international inquiry under the Geneva Conventions. Such an investigation, which requires the consent of the governments of the United States and Afghanistan, would be conducted by the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission, a body formed in 1991 but never used. Neither government is likely to approve such an inquiry.Jason Cone, the United States executive director of Doctors Without Borders, said that while the organization would cooperate with any investigation by the United States military or the NATO coalition, those would be ""rooted in the context of military doctrine and practice, not international humanitarian law.""""If international humanitarian law is flouted, if violations on this scale can be dismissed as a 'mistake,' 'the fog of war' or even just 'a terrible tragedy,' then all of our medical staff, projects and patients in conflict zones could be jeopardized,"" Mr. Cone wrote in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times on Saturday.As fighting intensified in northern Afghanistan this year, the group's 94-bed trauma center in Kunduz provided valuable medical services. Last year, the hospital treated more than 22,000 patients and conducted 5,900 operations, the statement said; what remains now are ""collapsed roofs, blackened walls, floors thick with dust and twisted pieces of metal that were once beds or trolleys."" The burden of providing medical assistance amid intense fighting has fallen to two Afghan health centers, low on staff, medicine and surgical capacity.""Until M.S.F. understands what happened on the night of the attack and has strong assurances that it cannot happen again, the Kunduz trauma center cannot be reopened,"" the statement added.Before he acknowledged that the United States military broke its own rules in calling in the airstrike, General Campbell and his staff shifted their response several times on why such a major hospital, which had repeatedly shared its exact coordinates as a humanitarian center with his forces, was struck so brutally. Doctors Without Borders has said the bombing continued for over an hour, despite desperate calls by employees to military offices in Kabul and Washington. The military's initial reaction to the airstrike said it was carried out against those ""threatening the force,"" a reference to a Special Operations unit deployed in the area to assist the Afghan forces. Later, General Campbell acknowledged that the strikes were called for by Afghan forces who had come under fire.Afghan officials, on the other hand, have continued to stick to the narrative that the Taliban were firing at their forces from the hospital grounds. As recently as last week, the acting minister of defense, Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, said the hospital was used as a ""safe place"" by the insurgents.The comments from Afghan officials came without a clear investigation on their side. While they have said a nongovernmental fact-finding mission set up to investigate the fall of Kunduz to the Taliban on Sept. 28 would also look into the hospital bombing, it is now clear that the mandate does not extend that far.""The mandate of the Kunduz fact-finding mission doesn't cover events beyond Sept. 28,"" said Amrullah Saleh, a former intelligence chief who is a leader of the mission. ""The team focuses on finding reasons for failure in leadership, structures and resources management.""Doctors Without Borders has expressed ""disgust"" at the claims that the hospital was used by the Taliban to fire on Afghan forces, saying such a narrative suggested ""that Afghan and U.S. forces working together decided to raze to the ground a fully functioning hospital.""",1.0
U.S. Soldier Dies in Raid to Free Prisoners of ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BAGHDAD -- An American soldier was killed in action in Iraq for the first time since the renewed military intervention here last year, during a Kurdish and United States commando raid to free prisoners being held by Islamic State militants on Thursday, the Pentagon said.The raid, near the northern town of Hawija, freed about 70 prisoners but not the group the soldiers had expected to find, American and Iraqi officials said. American officials said that five Islamic State fighters had been detained and that important intelligence about the terrorist group had been recovered.The raid was the first time American soldiers had been confirmed to be directly accompanying local forces in Iraq onto the battlefield against the Islamic State since President Obama sent troops back to the country last year. Until now, the American contingent, which numbers around 3,500, had been limited to training and advising the Iraqi and Kurdish forces on military bases and training areas. But senior American military officials have long signaled that they might ask the White House for permission to send small teams into the field with Iraqi forces for some important operations, such as the battle for Mosul.The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, said the United States was trying to help a loyal ally -- the Kurdish Regional Government -- and was also rushing to save lives.""This was a unique circumstance in which very close partners of the United States made a specific request for our assistance,"" he said. ""So I would not suggest that this is something that's going to now happen on a regular basis.""It was not, Mr. Cook insisted, a forerunner of a more aggressive posture in which American troops would regularly join the Iraqis on combat operations.The decision to use American helicopters to fly Kurdish commandos to Hawija, and to have American Special Operations forces join them in a supporting role, was taken by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter. The White House, Mr. Cook said, was informed in advance.Providing new details about the operation, American officials said on Thursday night that it had been mounted at the request of the Kurdish officials who insisted they had solid intelligence that the Islamic State was about to massacre prisoners, including a number of pesh merga fighters, as the Kurdish forces are known.""They were going with or without us,"" said a senior Defense Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a classified operation. ""We wanted to stand behind an important ally.""Fears that the prisoners were in danger may have been reinforced by the militants' actions in recent days. An Iraqi in the Hawija area, who asked not to be named because he feared retribution from the Islamic State, said this week that the militants had recently executed 11 young men who were the sons or relatives of police officers or other Iraqi forces. He said their bodies had been displayed on a nearby bridge.Five American helicopters were involved in the raid, a mix of Chinook and Black Hawk choppers. The American forces included commandos from the Delta Force counterterrorism unit, officials said.As the operation began, the United States conducted an airstrike to destroy a bridge near Hawija and hamper the Islamic State's ability to send reinforcements. But the operation soon became an intense firefight.Kurdish forces were to take the lead in the operation while American soldiers, who were to play a supporting role, initially were near a wall that was some distance from the objective, officials said.But the Kurds were pinned down by fire from the militants. So the Americans began to maneuver to relieve the pressure on their Kurdish allies and one of them was fatally wounded, said Col. Steven H. Warren, a spokesman for the American-led coalition in Iraq.When the prisoners were freed, the Kurds were surprised to see that no pesh merga fighters were among them. It is not clear whether the initial intelligence was bad or the Islamic State had moved the Kurds somewhere else.Instead of the about 20 prisoners the commandos had anticipated, there were 69, the Kurds said. They included more than 20 Iraqi security forces, some local residents and apparently some militants whom the Islamic State suspected as being traitors, according to American officials.Freed hostages have told Iraqi and American officials in Erbil, where they were taken, that they had been told they were to be executed at dawn on Thursday after the morning prayer. Trench graves had already been dug.As the American helicopters flew away, an American F-15 jet bombed the house that the Islamic State has used as its prison. Iraqis from the area said the building that the militants took over was owned by a local judge who had left the region.""They cut off roads and raided the place successfully,"" Najmaldin Karim, the governor of the surrounding Kirkuk Province, said in a telephone interview. ""They were able to take people with them.""Kurdish security officials said Thursday night in a statement that more than 20 militants had been killed in the firefight and that six militants, not the five reported by the United States, had been captured. The Kurdish statement said that three Kurdish commandos had been injured.A news agency linked with the Islamic State asserted that three militants who were defending the prison had been killed, and it said that Islamic State fighters had killed some of their prisoners.The operation comes as Iraq and the American-led coalition have been trying to regain the initiative, stepping up the pressure against the militants in Ramadi, Baiji and other areas in Iraq, as well as in Syria.Hawija is under the control of the Islamic State and has been an important flash point. Kurdish forces advanced toward the area in recent weeks and were said to have taken significant casualties, according to American officials.The raid may intensify the public debate in the United States over the Americans' military role in the region. The Obama administration has said that its goal is to degrade and ultimately defeat the Islamic State, but the campaign against the militants has progressed slowly.Some experts say there is no such thing as a risk-free conflict and that American teams will need to venture outside their bases to advise Iraqi forces if they are to evict the Islamic State from Iraq. Critics, however, are likely to portray the raid as a case of mission creep.The Pentagon has not yet named the soldier who was killed, a standard procedure until relatives are notified. Military personnel from other coalition nations have also been killed in the campaign against the Islamic State since its advance through Iraq last year. A Canadian soldier was killed in northern Iraq in March in a so-called friendly-fire incident involving Kurdish troops. And a Jordanian pilot was burned to death this year by the Islamic State after his plane crashed in Syria in December.While American commando operations have taken place in Syria, none had previously been confirmed to have happened n Iraq.",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; India: 6 Killed at Kashmir Outpost:   [Foreign Desk ],,"NEW DELHI -- Two heavily armed militants wearing Indian Army uniforms opened fire on a police station near the Pakistani border early Friday, killing three Indian security personnel and a civilian, officials said.The attack, for which Indian officials blamed Pakistan, was the first since a new coalition government took power in the disputed Kashmir region earlier this month. It could sway a debate over whether to overturn a contentious law that gives Indian security forces wide latitude to use force in the region without fear of prosecution.Members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, which makes up part of Jammu and Kashmir State's new governing coalition, have opposed lifting the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, and the attack Friday could provide them with further justification for their stance.""Our neighbor is not rectifying their ways,"" Jitendra Singh, a junior minister in Mr. Modi's office, said after the attack, referring to Pakistan.The police station, which is about 10 miles from the heavily guarded Pakistani border, came under attack from two militants dressed in Indian battle fatigues who opened fire with Kalishnikov rifles, officials said. ""They asked the guard to open the door and immediately shot him dead,"" Danish Rana, a police inspector general, told reporters.

More U.S. Troops Seen Staying in Afghanistan:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is nearing a decision to keep more troops in Afghanistan next year than it had intended, effectively upending its drawdown plans in response to roiling violence in the country and another false start in the effort to open peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government.As recently as last month, American officials had hoped that a renewed push to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table would yield the beginnings of a peace process and allow the United States to stick with its plan to drop the number of troops in Afghanistan from just under 10,000 to about 5,600 by the end of the year.But those hopes have been dashed by signs that the Taliban remain deeply divided over whether to engage in talks, as they have been for years, and that the remaining Qaeda presence in the region is proving more resilient than officials had anticipated.As a result, Afghan and American officials are girding for another year of bloody fighting with the insurgents. Senior Obama administration officials broadly concluded during meetings over the last week that many of the roughly 10,000 troops and thousands of civilian contractors in Afghanistan would be needed well into 2016, officials said.A change in the administration's plans would be further evidence of the continuing demands of America's longest war, which has raged on even after President Obama declared an end to America's ""combat role"" in Afghanistan. It would also reflect the impact of events in Iraq last year, where Iraqi military units collapsed in the face of an offensive by the Islamic State and the administration was compelled to send troops back to the country.At the same time, the change would expose Mr. Obama to criticism from members of his own party who have pressed him to end America's military role in Afghanistan. Some of the American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified deliberations over troop strength, said there might not be a public announcement on troop numbers to avoid potential criticism that Mr. Obama is backing away from his pledge to end the war in Afghanistan before he leaves office.The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said on Thursday that Mr. Obama had yet to make a final decision about altering the plans to pull out troops, most of whom are there to train and advise Afghan forces, not to fight. But Mr. Earnest added that the president has always said that the military strategy would ""constantly be checked against the security situation inside Afghanistan.""Another senior administration official said that Afghanistan's new president, Ashraf Ghani, had requested flexibility on the pace of the drawdown, and that ""we are actively considering that request.""Other officials said that the decision was all but made and that only the details had to be worked out. ""President Obama has to decide the slope, the pace, of the withdrawal, but all indications are that he'll delay,"" said one of the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal policy deliberations.The intensity of the fighting in Afghanistan usually ebbs and flows with changing seasons, and the Taliban usually hunker down during the colder months when the high mountain passes connecting them to sanctuaries in Pakistan are blocked by snow. But snow and cold have brought little relief this year, with American military officials saying that the fighting this winter has been among the most intense since the war began.The approaching summer fighting season is expected to be even more intense, adding to the urgency of the situation. There are also concerns about the ability of Afghan forces, which have struggled to hold off Taliban offensives since taking the lead in security over the past two years.Exactly how many American troops would remain in Afghanistan, and how far into 2016 they would stay, is still to be decided, the officials said. They also insisted that the administration was, for now, committed to withdrawing all but a small force to protect the embassy in Kabul by the end of 2016.Mr. Obama is expected to discuss the shifting plans for 2016 when he meets with Mr. Ghani during a scheduled visit to Washington next week. Mr. Ghani has pushed to keep as many international troops on hand as possible for as long as possible.American commanders have similarly called for a slower withdrawal. But Mr. Obama's wariness of his military's judgment on Afghanistan runs deep, and Mr. Ghani's willingness to work with the United States has been ""a big deal"" for Mr. Obama, a senior American official said.""There's a partner there now, and the thinking is that we should help,"" the official said.Since assuming office in September, Mr. Ghani has shown a far greater willingness to work with the United States than had his predecessor, Hamid Karzai. Mr. Ghani, for example, eased restrictions on nighttime raids and airstrikes by American-led forces put in place by Mr. Karzai.During a trip to Afghanistan last month, Ashton B. Carter, the new secretary of defense, said the administration was open to slowing the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, citing the improved relations under Mr. Ghani. And military leaders have openly said that Afghan forces still need American support.""We have to make sure that the Afghan security forces continue to improve,"" said Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, speaking to the benefits of a more prolonged drawdown during a House hearing on Tuesday.""We have to continue to help them as they continue to fight,"" he added. ""It's important we stay with them and that we have a conditions-based capability.""On the ground in Afghanistan, those conditions remain tenuous. In eastern and southern Afghanistan, where the Taliban have traditionally been strongest, only airstrikes and other help from the American-led military coalition kept the Taliban from seizing significant territory during last year's fighting season. The insurgents also pushed into parts of northern Afghanistan that were recently viewed as being firmly under government control.Keeping the number of troops closer to 10,000 would also allow the American-led coalition to maintain two large bases in Kandahar, the main city in southern Afghanistan, and in Jalalabad, the biggest city in the country's east. The base in Jalalabad is a hub for the collection of intelligence on Qaeda operations; it was, for instance, the base from which American forces launched the raid in 2011 that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan.Despite the formal end of the American-led combat mission in Afghanistan, coalition forces are still regularly launching airstrikes to support Afghan soldiers and police, and American Special Operations troops are still raiding remote villages and mountainside redoubts that shelter both Taliban fighters and operatives from Al Qaeda and other foreign extremist groups.In Washington, officials have sought to draw a sharp line between the two groups, saying counterterrorism forces -- which number about 2,000 -- are in Afghanistan to target only those who pose a direct threat to the United States. The Taliban, whose main focus is toppling Afghanistan's government, is a problem for Afghan forces.But distinctions on the ground are more blurred. Foreign fighters often work alongside Taliban insurgents, providing expertise.To help Afghan forces, American commanders have also interpreted their mandate to target any insurgent, Taliban or otherwise, who intends to attack coalition or Afghan forces, allowing them to go after Taliban commanders and other insurgents.",1.0
Somali Militant Is Killed in Strike:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon said Wednesday that airstrikes last week against the Shabab extremist group were successful, and that Adan Garar, a senior member of the group, had been killed in a drone strike on his vehicle.The strike, carried out last Thursday as Mr. Garar traveled near Diinsoor, Somalia, ""dealt another significant blow"" to the Shabab group and killed Mr. Garar, who is believed to have planned the 2013 attack on the Westgate mall in Kenya, the Defense Department said.For nearly a decade the United States has been trying to fight the Shabab through economic sanctions, missile strikes and commando raids. Last year, the Obama administration stepped up its efforts, and in September an American drone strike killed the leader the group, Ahmed Abdi Godane, one of the most wanted men in Africa.At the time President Obama drew a direct link between the killing of Mr. Godane, who turned an obscure local militant group into one of the most fearsome franchises of Al Qaeda in the world, and American plans to go after the leaders of the Islamic State in Iraq. The Pentagon press secretary at the time, Rear Adm. John Kirby, called the death of Mr. Godane ""a major symbolic and operational loss"" to the Shabab.",1.0
"Piles of Rocks, Thrown Across America's Bow:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BEIJING -- Much more is at stake in the American decision to challenge China by sending a destroyer near islands it built in the South China Sea than a handful of rocks, even if they sit on major shipping lines and deposits of natural resources.China, analysts say, is seeking to establish a sphere of influence in these waters -- and edge out the United States.What that means -- whether it represents a crisis, or a natural and inevitable shift given China's economic strength -- depends on whom you ask. But there is little doubt that China is thinking big about how these islands could limit America's military options, about how control over these waters could give it leverage over key trade routes and about how making the United States look hapless could strengthen its diplomatic clout in the region.""They have a game plan; it is very clear what it is,"" said Christopher K. Johnson, senior adviser on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington at a recent seminar. ""Sometimes, I think it is easy to get lost in the weeds on what has been built on which island.""On late Monday, the United States sent a guided missile destroyer into waters near one of the artificial islands, Subi Reef, that China considers its territory. China promptly called the naval patrol a ""deliberate provocation.""The construction of the islands, which has also involved building military installations and runways, shows how China is determined to push back the United States' post-World War II alliance system, some experts say.The United States sent ships and planes to the Taiwan Strait with impunity during a crisis 20 years ago in what was considered a strategic backyard for American forces. It would be much more difficult today for the United States to act in the same manner, Mr. Johnson said.To achieve its goals, China is spending heavily on its navy, including on nuclear-powered submarines. The construction of a second aircraft carrier is underway to supplement the first carrier, launched in 2012. Its Coast Guard is growing rapidly and now has the world's largest cutter, a 10,000-metric-ton vessel built at the Jiangnan Shipyard, where its builders nicknamed it the ""monster.""Shipbuilding for China's Coast Guard is so robust that the fleet now has more than three times as many ships than had been planned just a few years ago, said Ryan D. Martinson, research administrator at the China Maritime Studies Institute at the United States Naval War College in Newport, R.I.The buildup of maritime power means China, traditionally a continental power, is transforming its capabilities in an effort to secure its interests along the vital sea lanes that pass from the South China Sea through the Strait of Malacca and across the Indian Ocean to Africa and the Middle East into Europe. Much of China's commercial trade and energy supplies travel that route.How the South China Sea would operate with a dominant China is a matter of debate.Does China want to threaten foreign powers with force if they intervene, a model fashioned after the Monroe Doctrine, asked M. Taylor Fravel, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. If the goal was to try to exclude the United States, then China's actions so far have been counterproductive, he said.Mr. Fravel suggested that the free flow of shipping through the South China Sea was not incompatible with greater Chinese influence in the region.""If the attraction of China's economy and of Chinese investment is one source of political influence, China has few incentives to interfere with the international waterways in the South China Sea,"" he said. ""In fact, such interference would likely weaken China's influence and not enhance it. If China aspires to greater influence in the region, its ability to achieve and maintain that influence requires ensuring an open, dynamic trading system that links Asia with other regions.""Others are less sanguine. Creating a sphere of influence in the South China Sea would not necessarily mean China would abide by the rules, Kurt M. Campbell, former assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said at the recent Center for Strategic and International Studies seminar.The United States is trying to persuade China to sustain the post-World War II operating system in Asia -- freedom of navigation, peaceful settlement of disputes and fidelity of contracts -- that has given Asia perhaps its best four or five decades in 1,000 years, Mr. Campbell said. But now the Chinese are saying the status quo no longer holds in the South China Sea. It is natural, but worrying, that as a rising power challenging the existing order, China wants to put its ""own stamp on things,"" he said.""If you listen very carefully to Chinese friends, they are saying this is no longer an international waterway,"" Mr. Campbell said. ""That we will provide safety for the ships transmitting this water. My own personal view is that this is antithetical to our strategic interests and in fact antithetical to Chinese strategic interests.""Despite concerns in the United States, it is not in China's interests to use force to get its way in the South China Sea, said Wu Xinbo, director of the center of American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. ""It would be foolish for China to use force on other claimants in the South China Sea. The political and strategic cost is too high.""China's objectives are not necessarily sinister and from its point of view represent a ""sensible"" strategic approach, said former Rear Adm. Michael McDevitt, now a senior fellow at CNA, a nonprofit research organization in Arlington, Va.""Since the South China Sea was the traditional route the West used on the way to invading, China wants to make sure that eventually they can establish sea control in the South China Sea in times of conflict,"" Mr. McDevitt said, referring to Britain and other European powers. ""It is our job to make sure that they cannot keep us at bay should there be a conflict.""Hugh White, a critic of the United States' response to China's growing power whose message is unpopular in Washington but well received among Chinese analysts, said China's short-term goal in the South China Sea was to throw its weight around and to show America's allies that Washington was unable to respond effectively.The Obama administration had tried with its freedom-of-navigation maneuver near the artificial island, Subi Reef, to show that it was doing something to counter Chinese ambitions, said Mr. White, a professor of strategic studies at Australian National University.But the action was too timid, he said. The destroyer traveled within 12 nautical miles of the new island, and then left quietly and quickly, and American officials were barred from describing it in any detail. It left the opposite impression of being strong in the face of a determined power and allowed the Chinese to move ahead undeterred, he said.""It showed just how reluctant Washington is to stand up to China for fear of provoking a crisis,"" Mr. White said.",1.0
Turkey Says It Hit Kurdish Militias in Cross-Border Raids:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Turkey has confirmed that it struck positions in Syria held by Kurdish militias that over the last year have become the most important allies within Syria of the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State.The confirmation of the strikes, which the Kurds said took place over the weekend, adds a new level of complexity to the United States' struggle to put together a coherent strategy to fight the Islamic State in Syria. It also increases tensions between the United States and Turkey, which are nominally allies in the battle against the militant group, but whose interests diverge substantially.In an interview on a Turkish news channel Monday night, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey did not specify when the strikes had taken place, but he said they came after Turkey's government in Ankara warned Kurdish fighters not to move west of the Euphrates River.""We struck them twice,"" Mr. Davutoglu said.The Turkish strikes were in Tal Abyad, a largely Arab border town that the Kurds captured from the Islamic State over the summer. The strikes appear to have been limited -- they were said to involve machine-gun fire from across the border and did not seem to cause much damage -- but they could suggest a new determination by Turkey to expand military operations against the American-allied group.Turkey has long considered the Syrian Kurdish group known as the Democratic Union Party, or P.Y.D., as an enemy because it is the Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has long fought an insurgency against the Turkish state.The armed wing of the P.Y.D., the People's Protection Units, said in a statement that Turkey struck its positions in Tal Abyad on Saturday and Sunday and that a separate Turkish attack, on Sunday in the village of Buban, wounded two civilians.The group has accused Turkey of targeting it on several occasions, but Mr. Davutoglu's comments on Monday were the first time Turkey acknowledged doing so.The limited Turkish strikes came after the P.Y.D. declared last week that Tal Abyad was part of an autonomous region in northern Syria that the Kurds call Rojava. Turkey views the development as a national security threat because it could inflame separatist sentiments among its own Kurds.The government had already renewed fighting in July with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K., both in Turkey and in Iraq, where the group has camps in the mountains of the north. But Turkey had, for a time, seemed to turn a blind eye to Syria's Kurds because of their growing relationship with the United States, which had argued that the P.Y.D. should be regarded as separate from the P.K.K., even though the groups have close ties and a shared socialist ideology.Turkey now seems intent on viewing the two groups as one and the same. In recent weeks, it has sharply criticized United States support for the Syrian Kurds, which began last year during the battle for Kobani.The situation grew more complicated recently when Russia began military operations in Syria, largely in support of the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, which Turkey has sought to oust through its support of rebel groups.Russia's ties to the P.K.K. and the P.Y.D. date to the days of the Soviet Union, and it is believed to be offering support to Syrian Kurds.To register its displeasure, Turkey recently summoned the ambassadors of Russia and the United States to raise concerns over support to the Syrian Kurds.This coincided with a move that alarmed Turkey, an American airdrop of 50 tons of ammunition in northern Syria to a coalition of Arab and Kurdish fighters who were preparing to battle the Islamic State near its Syrian stronghold of Raqqa.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"Saudi Coalition Destroys a Hospital in Yemen, Aid Group Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- A hospital in northern Yemen run by Doctors Without Borders was destroyed by warplanes belonging to a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia, even though the coalition had been given the coordinates of the hospital, the relief organization said Tuesday.The airstrikes, about 10:30 p.m. Monday, forced the evacuation of staff and patients from the site and raised new questions about what precautions Saudi Arabia and its military partners were taking to avoid civilians.The coalition, of 10 Arab states, receives military and intelligence support from the United States and has been battling Yemen's Houthi rebels since March. Bombings by the coalition have killed more than 1,100 people -- the majority of civilian casualties during the war, according to human rights advocates. The airstrikes have also hit nonmilitary targets, including markets, houses and wedding parties.""With the hospital destroyed, at least 200,000 people now have no access to lifesaving medical care,"" Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. Hassan Boucenine, the group's head of mission in Yemen, said in the statement that the attack was ""another illustration of a complete disregard for civilians in Yemen, where bombings have become a daily routine.""A spokesman for the coalition did not return phone calls seeking comment.Mr. Boucenine said in an interview that the hospital was hit by several airstrikes while roughly a dozen patients and staff members were inside. The operating theater and maternity ward were struck. The staff evacuated the hospital between strikes, and one staff member was slightly injured in the escape.The airstrikes then continued for at least two hours, leaving most of the facility in rubble, the group said.Doctors Without Borders had supplied the hospital's coordinates to the coalition about six months ago and reconfirmed them every month, Mr. Boucenine said. The group's logo was on the roof.The small hospital, in the Haydan district along the border with Saudi Arabia, was one of the few still operating in the northern province of Saada. The province has been heavily bombed by the coalition for months.Doctors Without Borders said about 3,400 patients had been treated since the group began supporting the hospital in May.""The bombing of civilians and hospitals is a violation of international humanitarian law and M.S.F. is demanding that coalition forces explain the circumstances around the attack,"" the statement said, using the abbreviation for the group's French name, Médecins Sans Frontières.American officials said little Tuesday about the hospital airstrikes.""Senior U.S. officials remain in close and regular contact with the Saudi government on a wide range of issues related to Yemen,"" said Col. Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for the United States Central Command. ""We have asked the Saudi government to investigate all credible reports of civilian casualties resulting from coalition-led airstrikes and, if confirmed, to address the factors that led to them.""Spokesmen for the White House and the C.I.A. declined to comment.",1.0
"Challenging Chinese Claims, U.S. Sends Warship to Artificial Island Chain:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"WASHINGTON -- A United States Navy destroyer entered waters near the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea late Monday, Defense Department officials said, directly challenging China's claims that the artificial island chain is within its territorial borders.The Lassen, a guided missile destroyer, sailed within 12 nautical miles of the islands, making a long-anticipated entry into the disputed waters, an American military official said. American officials did not inform their Chinese counterparts as they planned the provocative maneuver, saying that to do so would have undercut their message.""You don't need to consult with any nation when you are exercising the right of freedom of navigation in international waters,"" John Kirby, the State Department spokesman, said at a news conference.Mr. Kirby said that such a challenge to what he called a questionable sovereignty claim was ""one of the reasons you have a navy -- to be able to exert influence and defend freedom of navigation on international waters.""China has been reclaiming land in the South China and East China Seas for several years, and the projects in the vicinity of the Spratlys have come under increasing criticism from the United States and its regional allies, including the Philippines. The United States and several Asian nations dispute the legitimacy of the islands built by China.As news of the American maneuver circulated in Beijing, China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, urged the United States to ""think twice before taking any reckless action,"" China's national broadcaster, CCTV, reported.The Obama administration did not make an immediate announcement of the maneuver, and Pentagon officials would only confirm that it had occurred, as they forecast weeks ago.The White House declined to share any details about the operation, referring questions to the Defense Department. But Josh Earnest, the press secretary, noted that President Obama stood next to President Xi Jinping of China at a Rose Garden news conference last month and said that the United States would operate, fly or sail anywhere that international law allowed.""That certainly includes the ability of our Navy to operate in international waters,"" Mr. Earnest said. ""This is a critically important principle, particularly in the South China Sea, because there are billions of dollars of commerce that flow through that region of the world every year -- maybe even more than that -- and ensuring the free flow of this commerce, and that freedom of navigation of those vessels is protected, is critically important to the global economy.""American officials had said for the last month that the Navy would send a surface ship into the waters claimed by China, a vow widely viewed as a signal to the Chinese that most of the rest of the world does not recognize its claim on the island chain. Mr. Obama approved the move this month, administration officials said.The president signaled the Navy maneuver last month at the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, when he said that the United States had an ""interest in upholding the basic principles of freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce and in resolving disputes through international law, not the law of force.""China, in what some Asia analysts interpreted as a gesture to pre-empt the American naval maneuver, sent warships into United States territorial waters in August. Five Chinese ships came within 12 miles of the coast of Alaska while Mr. Obama was visiting the state.But American military officials said that the two maneuvers were not comparable, citing international maritime laws that allow passage such as the Chinese transit near Alaska if there is no other passageway for a ship to reach its destination.In the case of the Spratly Islands, one American military official said, there were several other routes that the United States destroyer could have used, but the military deliberately chose to enter the waters that China claims as its territory.In recent years, China has been claiming large parts of the strategic waterway by enlarging rocks and submerged reefs into islands big enough for military airstrips, radar equipment and lodging for soldiers, American officials said.Although China claims much of the South China Sea as sovereign territory, the 12-mile zone around the new islands is particularly delicate because international law says that artificial islands do not have sovereign rights up to the 12-mile limit.The United States had not traveled close to the Chinese-occupied islands in the South China Sea since at least 2012. In May, a United States Navy surveillance plane flew near three of China's five artificial islands but did not go within the 12-mile zones. Chinese Navy radio operators warned the Americans to leave the area.Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.",1.0
"U.S. Airstrike Killed Iraqis by Accident, Officials Say:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"ABOARD THE U.S.S. KEARSARGE -- An airstrike that mistakenly killed Iraqi troops on Friday was carried out by an American plane, United States officials said on Saturday.The episode poses a fresh challenge to the Obama administration's efforts to expand cooperation with the Iraqis in fighting the Islamic State, and Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter was quick to call the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, to express his condolences and invite Iraq to participate in an investigation.Mr. Carter did not offer a detailed explanation for the errant airstrike, which killed nine Iraqi soldiers and one officer, according to Iraq's defense minister. But Mr. Carter said, ""It seemed to be a mistake that involved both sides.""""These kind of things can happen when you are fighting side by side as we are, on a dynamic battlefield,"" Mr. Carter told reporters aboard the Kearsarge, an assault ship deployed in the Persian Gulf.Another American official, who asked for anonymity to discuss an episode under investigation, said the plane that carried out the attack was a B-1B bomber, which dropped several bombs as it was supporting Iraqi forces battling Islamic State fighters near Falluja. At least one of those bombs, it appears, struck the Iraqi troops.Bad weather may have been a contributing factor, American and Iraqi officials say. With fog in the area, it may have been difficult for reconnaissance drones or aircraft to keep track of the shifting Iraqi positions. A third American official said the Iraqi troops appeared to have been closer to the target area than the Americans had realized.There have been few instances of ""friendly fire"" in Iraq since the American-led campaign against the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, began last year. One important military question raised by the attack is whether the risk of such episodes might be reduced by deploying teams of air controllers with the Iraqi forces, particularly when Iraqi troops are fighting with the Islamic State in urban areas or at close quarters.Seeking to minimize the risk of American casualties, the Obama administration decided early in the campaign that the American advisers and trainers who are assisting Iraqi troops would work inside the confines of several large bases in Iraq. But that has meant that American commanders have had to rely on aircraft to confirm the targeting information provided by Iraqi troops instead of on American air controllers on the battlefield.A broader political question is whether the episode will make it harder for Mr. Abadi to accept an expanded role for the United States, which is seeking to speed up the campaign against the Islamic State. Mr. Carter told Congress this month that the Obama administration was prepared to support the Iraqi military with Apache attack helicopters in its fight to reclaim Ramadi. He also said the administration was ready to deploy advisers with select Iraqi brigades.""The United States is prepared to assist the Iraqi Army with additional unique capabilities to help them finish the job, including attack helicopters and accompanying advisers, if circumstances dictate and if requested by Prime Minister Abadi,"" Mr. Carter told the Senate Armed Services Committee.Mr. Abadi, however, has been weakened by a series of political struggles with his rivals, and has come under pressure from Shiite politicians who are close to Iran to reject a greater United States military role in Iraq. He did not take up the Pentagon on its offer when he met with Mr. Carter on Wednesday.But American officials hope that Mr. Abadi will agree to the use of Apache helicopters and advisers for future operations, which are expected to be more challenging as Iraqi forces look toward the battle for Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city.The political dynamics in Iraq were clear with the divergent response to the airstrike. Hakim al-Zamili, the chairman of the Iraqi Parliament's defense and security committee and a political supporter of the anti-United States Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, provided a far higher toll than the Defense Ministry's and demanded an investigation.Mr. Abadi, however, accepted Mr. Carter's explanation that the episode was a genuine mistake, and expressed hope that politicians in Iraq and elsewhere would not try to exploit the airstrike for their own purposes, according to the Americans' account of the phone call from Mr. Carter to Mr. Abadi.""He and I both expressed regret over the incident and also determination to continue the campaign to expel ISIL from Iraqi territory,"" Mr. Carter said.There are signs, however, that the political debate over the incident might linger, as even Iraqi officials who work closely with the Americans say there must strict accountability.According to the Iraqi military, the Iraqis turned to the American-led coalition for air support during the fight because bad weather precluded the use of Iraqi airpower. The American plane carried out two strikes, which resulted in a significant number of Islamic State casualties and enabled the Iraqi force to quickly advance. But the coalition that did not realize that the Iraqi troops had moved forward when a third strike occurred.Khaled al-Obeidi, Iraq's defense minister issued a statement on Saturday saying that Iraqis would carry out their own inquiry to determine whether Iraqi forces or the coalition was at fault for failing to update the information on the position of the Iraqi troops. The Iraqi government, he said, will not tolerate the loss of ""Iraqi blood.""Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.",1.0
"Bomber Was Near a Disputed Island in Error, U.S. Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"WASHINGTON -- A United States B-52 bomber last week mistakenly flew within two nautical miles of a disputed artificial island built by China in the South China Sea, Pentagon officials said Friday.The incident, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, drew the ire of the Chinese, who claim that the chain, called the Spratly Islands, is within China's territorial borders. That claim is disputed by China's neighbors and by the United States.""The Chinese have raised concerns with us about the flight path of a recent B-52 training mission,"" Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said Friday. ""We are looking into the incident.""On Saturday, China's Defense Ministry issued an angry response to the flight, which it said occurred on Dec. 10 and involved two bombers.""What the United States did was a serious military provocation, complicating the situation in the South China Sea, to the extent of militarizing it,"" the ministry said in a statement posted on its website. ""We demand that the United States immediately take action to prevent such dangerous actions from taking place, and not damage bilateral military relations.""But the Chinese gave no indication that they would take any specific actions in response, stating only that ""China's military will take all necessary means and measures to safeguard the country's sovereignty and security.""Captain Davis said that ""for this mission there was no intention of flying within 12 nautical miles"" of the island, using a phrase that seemed intended to show that it was only for this particular mission that the United States did not mean to fly close to the islands.In October, a United States Navy destroyer made a point of entering waters near the Spratly Islands in a challenge to China's claim that the chain is within its territorial borders. The ship, the Lassen, a guided-missile destroyer, sailed within 12 nautical miles of the islands, and American officials did not inform their Chinese counterparts as they planned the maneuver, saying that to do so would have undercut their message.News of the B-52 flight, and the Chinese response, came days after the United States announced a planned $1.83 billion arms sale to Taiwan, angering China, which said it would sanction American companies that made the armaments. China considers Taiwan, which has been governed separately since 1949, to be a breakaway province.Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: Asian Morning newsletter.

Airstrikes Take Toll on Civilians in Yemen War:   [Foreign Desk ],,"HAJJA, Yemen -- The airstrike slammed into Al-Sham water-bottling plant at the end of the night shift, killing 13 workers who were minutes away from heading home.Standing among the strewn bottles, smoldering boxes and pulverized machines a few days after the airstrike here, the owner, Ibrahim al-Razoom, searched in vain for any possible reason that warplanes from a Saudi-led military coalition would have attacked the place.Nothing in the ruins suggested the factory was used for making bombs, as a coalition spokesman had claimed. And it was far from any military facility that would explain the strike as a tragic mistake: For miles around, there was nothing but desert scrub.""It never occurred to me that this would be hit,"" Mr. Razoom said.Of the many perils Yemen's civilians have faced during the last six months of war, with starvation looming and their cities crumbling under heavy weapons, none have been as deadly as the coalition airstrikes. What began as a Saudi-led aerial campaign against the Houthis, the rebel militia movement that forced Yemen's government from power, has become so broad and vicious that critics accuse the coalition of collectively punishing people living in areas under Houthi control.Errant coalition strikes have ripped through markets, apartment buildings and refugee camps. Other bombs have fallen so far from any military target -- like the one that destroyed Mr. Razoom's factory -- that human rights groups say such airstrikes amount to war crimes. More than a thousand civilians are believed to have died in the strikes, the toll rising steadily with little international notice or outrage.Rather than turning more Yemenis against the Houthis, though, the strikes are crystallizing anger in parts of the country against Saudi Arabia and its partners, including the United States. The Obama administration has provided military intelligence and logistical assistance to the coalition, and American weapons have been widely used in the air campaign. Human Rights Watch has found American-manufactured cluster munitions in the fields of Yemeni farmers. Near the site of airstrikes that killed 11 people in a mosque, researchers with Amnesty International saw an unexploded, 1,000-pound American bomb. The United States is finalizing a deal to provide more weapons to Saudi Arabia, including missiles for its F-15 fighter jets.In parts of northern Yemen, which is populated largely by Shiite Muslims, residents told reporters making a rare visit to the area that the bombing campaign by the Sunni coalition often feels like a sectarian purge. Airstrikes nearest the border with Saudi Arabia have been so intense that people have taken shelter in mountain caves or been forced farther south, often on foot, where they set up flimsy camps on the side of the road.Neighborhoods in the northern city of Saada have been so heavily bombed that locals joke grimly that the coalition has run out of buildings to hit. The shrinking pool of targets has not stopped the planes that circle daily over Sana, the capital, from bombing the same security buildings over and over again, with a bewildering and terrible frequency.The Saudi-led coalition has rarely if ever acknowledged killing civilians by mistake, even after the deadliest strikes, like the bombing of a residential compound for workers in Mokha in July that killed at least 63 people. Instead, the coalition blames the Houthis, accusing them of fighting from populated areas.""Why would we acknowledge something that doesn't exist?"" said Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, the coalition's spokesman, when asked whether the airstrikes had killed noncombatants. He said it should fall to Yemen's exiled government or the United Nations to investigate such deaths.Col. Patrick S. Ryder, a spokesman for United States Central Command, said American officials had asked ""the Saudi government to investigate all credible reports of civilian casualties resulting from coalition-led airstrikes, and if confirmed, to address the factors that led to them.""A tense political standoff erupted into war in March, after the Houthi militias ousted the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who fled abroad. Saudi Arabia launched its offensive with the stated goal of returning Mr. Hadi to power, but was motivated by far deeper anxieties, analysts said.The Saudis, already shaken by the Obama administration's nuclear deal with their regional rival, Iran, viewed the Shiite-led Houthis as an Iranian proxy gaining strength just over its border. The Houthis have denied acting on Iran's orders; Saudi allies, including the United States, said the fears were exaggerated.More than 4,500 people have been killed in the war. Hundreds have died in street battles between the Houthis and their rivals for control of Yemen's most important cities, like Taiz and Aden, where residents have accused the Houthis in particular of resorting to brutal force. The ground war and harsh Saudi restrictions on imports have deepened humanitarian suffering in Yemen, causing shortages of fuel, water and medical supplies while inflating prices of food and other goods.The majority of civilians have been killed by coalition warplanes, often dropping American munitions ranging from 250 to 2,000 pounds. There are no comprehensive tallies of the deaths. But the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner said on Friday that of 1,527 civilians who died between the start of the Saudi offensive and June 30, at least 941 people were killed by airstrikes.The airstrikes have helped the coalition advance in southern Yemen, where anti-Houthi sentiment is strong. But the mounting civilian toll has raised concerns about the tactics of the coalition of Arab armies fighting alongside the Saudis, and seeking to prove its mettle as a regional counterweight to Iran's influence. As the coalition has amassed troops and weapons in central Yemen in preparation for a possible ground invasion of Sana, fears have grown that the capital, with its meticulously preserved Old City, will suffer the same fate as other Yemeni treasures destroyed during the conflict.The United Arab Emirates said its pilots have played a central role in a recent flurry of airstrikes, in apparent retaliation for a Houthi attack Aug. 4 that killed at least 45 Emirati soldiers fighting in Yemen. Since then, Sana has come under its heaviest bombardment of the war. The day after the Emirati soldiers were killed, at least 21 civilians died in airstrikes across the capital, according to relatives of the victims. Bombings in one district killed nine people, in a pattern that characterized many of the attacks.The coalition jets focused on a university that the Houthis had used as a base, plowing craters in the dirt and bombing a warehouse on the campus that appeared to be full of office furniture. But they also struck a residential area overlooking the university, with at least three separate airstrikes, partially damaging or demolishing six houses.""They kill innocents and claim to be killing Houthis. They are targeting the whole population,"" said Adam Mujahid Abdulla, a 20-year-old survivor of the strikes, who was recovering in a hospital last week, bandages covering burns over 65 percent of his body.The bomb that struck his house killed seven members of his family. But his friends, visiting in the hospital, were too worried about his condition to tell him that his relatives, including his mother and four siblings, had died.Across town, another airstrike sliced through a building of shops and apartments, killing seven people. In the rubble, people dug out the remains of Mohib Mohammed, 26, the local barber. ""They only found his legs,"" said Ayman Mahmoud, who arrived at the neighborhood soon after the airstrike.The strike's victims included Tayseer Okba, a 12-year-old girl who that morning had been visiting her 65-year-old grandmother, Amana al-Khowlani.There is little mystery about the repeated attacks on the northern Saada Province, the birthplace of the Houthi movement. Months ago, the Saudi coalition declared that the entire province was a military zone, drawing an outcry from human rights groups that did little to deter the warplanes.In border areas that the Houthis have used for attacks into Saudi Arabia, the coalition forces have struck deep into Yemeni territory, bombing hospitals, roads and towns even when no Houthi fighters are present, said Dr. Natalie Roberts, who worked with Doctors Without Borders in one of the few clinics in the province.Mothers delivered babies in caves where they found shelter. People who were ill waited weeks before traveling to hospitals. ""It's no kind of life,"" Dr. Roberts said. ""Waiting in a cave to see if you're going to get bombed.""A road leading into Saada has been cratered by airstrikes that destroyed at least four bridges and obliterated trucks carrying fuel or livestock. In Saada City, so many houses were bombed in one neighborhood that all the residents simply fled.Omar Mohammed al-Ghaily, 28, sat in the center of town, near the ruins of his clothing store, destroyed in airstrikes that razed a stretch of government buildings. The strikes killed Seif Ahmed Seif, who owned an umbrella store. Mr. Ghaily kept Mr. Seif's identity card, maybe to return it one day to his daughter, who lives far away in Taiz. He kept coming to the rubble, he said, because he had ""no place to go.""Saada had suffered mightily over the last decade, when the Houthis fought six wars against Yemen's central government. But those conflicts paled in comparison to the damage being inflicted by the coalition, Mr. Ghaily said: ""this war from the sky.""",1.0
Sea Dispute Causes a Rift as Officials Meet in Asia:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIJING -- Differences over the South China Sea forced countries from Southeast Asia, along with China and the United States, to cancel a joint statement at a meeting of defense ministers in Malaysia on Wednesday.The Chinese Ministry of Defense confirmed that the meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, had failed to conclude a joint declaration, and it blamed ""the individual country (countries) out of the region."" In a statement on its website, the ministry implied, but did not name, the United States as the main reason for the breakdown in the discussions.The ministry did not mention the South China Sea or China's insistence that the statement not include any mention of the strategic waterway.Diplomats from countries in the region said that China had pushed for even a factual statement of the South China Sea to be absent from the joint declaration scheduled for the end of the gathering Wednesday afternoon.The meeting was split between countries that agreed with China and those that strongly disagreed, including Australia, Japan and the United States, two senior diplomats involved in the talks said.China maintains that its territorial claims in the South China Sea must be discussed with individual countries that also have claims. It has consistently opposed efforts to have conflicting claims discussed in a regional setting like Asean, whose defense ministers are meeting in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, with their counterparts from Australia, India, Japan and the United States.""The responsibility fully rests on the individual country (countries) out of the region as the meeting failed to issue the joint statement as scheduled,"" the Chinese Defense Ministry said on its website.The American defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, was attending the meeting, and the United States led the effort to have the sea accorded a place in the communiqué, the diplomats said. Mr. Carter met with China's minister of defense, Chang Wanquan, on Tuesday in Malaysia, where the South China Sea was high on the agenda.The gathering in Malaysia comes a week after the United States carried out a freedom of navigation operation inside the 12-nautical-mile radius of Subi Reef, in the Spratly archipelago not far from the Philippines. The operation was devised by the Pentagon to show that the reef, which China has built into an artificial island with an airfield, was in international waters and was not entitled to a 12-mile territorial claim. China has built seven artificial islands in the South China Sea in the last several years.China's extensive island construction could bolster it militarily in the strategic waterway, something that has unnerved countries in the region. Some nations, like the Philippines, an American ally, and Vietnam, a former enemy, have asked the United States for more military assistance since China's policy on the South China Sea has hardened.""The countries of Southeast Asia are going to have to decide to push back against China, or see the South China Sea turn into a Chinese lake,"" one of the diplomats involved in the defense ministers gathering said.The sea was the most contentious issue among the Asean defense ministers in Malaysia. Both the Philippines and Vietnam were among the Asian countries unwilling to sign the declaration if it had no mention of the South China Sea, the diplomats said.",1.0
"Rebels Advance in Yemen, Despite Saudi Airstrikes:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"AL MUKALLA, Yemen -- Forces aligned with the Iranian-backed Houthi movement continued their advance into areas of southern Yemen on Friday as Saudi Arabia conducted a second day of airstrikes intended to stop them.The Houthis' advance in the face of airstrikes is focusing attention on the possibility of the Saudi-led coalition's deploying ground troops, a move that would further escalate Yemeni civil war toward a regional battle.The Saudi government has said it has no plans to send troops, but declined to rule out the possibility. On Thursday, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, a close ally of the Saudis, said Cairo was prepared to send troops ""if necessary.""President Obama, in a call Friday to King Salman of Saudi Arabia, emphasized the United States' support for the Saudi-led operation, according to a National Security Council statement, but both leaders said they sought a ""negotiated political solution.""Residents and local news reports said Friday that the Houthi-aligned forces were fighting in the streets of Aden, the southern town where the Saudi-backed president of Yemen, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, had until recently prepared to make his last stand.Clashes between the Houthi forces and fighters loyal to Mr. Hadi had plunged the city into chaos, residents said Friday. Soldiers had deserted army bases near the city, and opportunists had swooped in to plunder them.""They looted all military bases in the city,"" said one resident, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. ""Tanks were taken to pieces in one of the bases.""With Mr. Hadi's forces in disarray, civilians were arming themselves to oppose the incoming Houthi forces, and there was sporadic fighting in neighborhoods around the city. ""No one is leading the battles against the Houthis in Aden,"" the same resident said. ""People regrouped in the city's districts and formed their own militias to fight the Houthis.""Mr. Hadi lost control of the capital, Sana, to the Houthi forces months ago, and he finally escaped last month to take refuge among supporters in Aden. Then on Wednesday he disappeared again as the Houthi forces closed in, surfacing Thursday night in Saudi Arabia. On Friday, he landed in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, to represent Yemen at an Arab League meeting, but it was unclear whether he would return to Yemen anytime soon.The Houthis were also reported to be making gains in the restive southern provinces of Abyan and Shabwa, which had been expected to pose fierce resistance. Both provinces are home to pockets of Sunni Muslim extremists, including Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch, and the extremists loath the Houthis as heretics for following a variant of Shiite Islam.The Houthis represent a minority among Yemen's mostly Sunni Muslims, but the group has gained momentum by forming an alliance with Yemen's former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. He has helped enlist important parts of the military and security services still loyal to him to fight alongside the Houthis against Mr. Hadi's forces.On Thursday, the Houthi leaders sought to showcase their public support in the capital by holding a rally to condemn the Saudi Arabian air campaign. Thousands attended, suggesting that the movement may not be easy to crush through airstrikes alone.The Saudi-led coalition on Friday extended its airstrikes to three military bases controlled by forces loyal to Mr. Saleh and the Houthis in the central province of Marib, according to news reports and local tribal leaders. There were reports of strikes against the Houthi's home base in the north as well.Pentagon officials said late Friday that two Saudi airmen were rescued by the American military after they ejected from their plane over the Gulf of Aden.Philip Hammond, the British foreign secretary, said Friday that Britain, like the United States, was providing logistical and technical support to the Saudi-led campaign. He noted that the intervention had been requested by Yemen's legitimate government, under Mr. Hadi. ""But we're clearly not going to get involved in military action ourselves,"" Mr. Hammond said.He also discounted Saudi efforts to portray the Houthis as an instrument of Iranian influence.""The Houthi are not Iranian proxies in the sense that Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy,"" he added. ""I suspect if you went to Tehran, you'd find a degree of frustration in Tehran that, for all the support they pile in, they can't actually control what the Houthis do.""Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, denounced the Saudi-led operation Friday, accusing the kingdom of unleashing Sunni extremists like Al Qaeda against Shiites elsewhere.Mr. Hadi's foreign minister, Riyadh Yassin, in an interview Friday with the BBC, said that he hoped the airstrikes would end ""as soon as possible,"" and that the Houthis would ""understand the meaning of these strikes"" and come to negotiations.As for a ground invasion, he said it depended on ""the evaluation of the experts and the military people.""",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; South Korea: Two Men Are Arrested in North Korea on Spying Charges:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said on Friday that it had arrested two South Korean men on espionage charges for collecting military and other secrets on the isolated country, including data regarding its top leadership, and infiltrating it with political propaganda and subversive religious materials.During a news conference in Pyongyang on Thursday, the two men identified themselves as Kim Guk-gi, 60, and Choe Chun-gil, 55, and apologized for committing ""anti-state"" crimes while spying on behalf of South Korea's National Intelligence Service, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said in a dispatch on Friday.Officials from the State Security Department, the North's secret police, told the news conference that Mr. Kim and Mr. Choe were ""heinous terrorists"" who tried to harm the North's top leadership with ""assassination"" plots, the news agency said.The South Korean government immediately dismissed the claims as groundless, but confirmed that the men were its citizens. Lim Byeong-cheol, spokesman for the South Korean Ministry of National Unification, issued a statement on Friday demanding their immediate release and urging the North to allow South Korean lawyers to visit them. . The South Korean spy agency had also previously dismissed similar cases of alleged spying as fabrications by the North.The cases of Mr. Kim and Mr. Choe came amid growing signs that the border between China and North Korea has become part of a murky struggle between the rival Koreas. In recent years, South Korea has arrested several people who it said were North Korean spies who crossed the China-North Korea border and arrived in the South disguised as refugees.At the same time, the North has been accused of kidnapping or arresting several South Koreans or Korean-Americans who operated near the border, or visited the impoverished country as humanitarian workers or missionaries. North Korea charged them with working as spies. Last year, it sentenced a South Korean Baptist missionary to hard labor for life on charges of spying for the South and setting up an underground church to undermine the North Korean government.On Friday, North Korea said that Mr. Choe, who had lived in Dandong, a Chinese city near the border with North Korea, was arrested in December while visiting the North to smuggle out jewelry. It was not clear how Mr. Kim, who told the news conference that he had also lived in Dandong since 2003, ended up in the North.During the news conference, Mr. Kim said he was running an underground Christian church in Dandong in 2005, proselytizing among ethnic Koreans in China and North Korean refugees, when he was recruited as a spy by a National Intelligence Service official, the news agency said. Mr. Kim said he had been paid tens of thousands of dollars and given encrypted cellphones to collect information on plans by Kim Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, to visit China. Mr. Choe said his spy master instructed him between 2012 and 2013 to collect soil samples from near Yongbyon, the North's main nuclear complex, north of the capital Pyongyang.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
"U.S. Airstrikes on Tikrit Prompt Boycott, and Threats, by Shiite Fighters:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"AL RASHID AIR BASE, Iraq -- By Day 2 of the American airstrike campaign against militants holed up in Tikrit, the mission appeared beleaguered on several fronts on Thursday: Thousands of Shiite militiamen boycotted the fight, others threatened to attack any Americans they found, and Iraqi officials said nine of their fighters had been accidentally killed in an airstrike.In Washington, American military leaders insisted that things were going according to plan. They said that they were stepping into the Tikrit fight only after the Iranian- and militia-led advance on the city had stalled after three weeks, and that they welcomed working solely with Iraqi government forces.Gen. Lloyd Austin, the head of the United States Central Command, told a Senate hearing on Thursday that no Shiite militias remained in Tikrit.While the withdrawal of Iranian-led Shiite militias was one of the preconditions for the Americans to join the fight against the Islamic State in Tikrit, the sudden departure of three of the major groups risked leaving the Iraqi ground forces short-handed, especially if other Shiite militiamen also abandoned the fight.The three militia groups, some of which had Iranian advisers with them until recently, pulled out of the Tikrit fight to protest the American airstrikes, which began late Wednesday night, insisting that the Americans were not needed to defeat the extremists in Tikrit.Too great or abrupt a withdrawal by militia forces, analysts said, could complicate the entire Iraqi counteroffensive. Even with the militias involved, officials said the current pro-government force would not be large enough to eventually help take Mosul back from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.Top officials at the Pentagon appeared to think that it would not be easy to retake even Tikrit without Iranian help. ""It's going to require the kind of hammer-and-anvil approach of ground forces forcing ISIL to respond in ways that they're targetable by air power,"" one Defense Department official said. ""But we're less than 24 hours into it.""Another official, asked if he was worried that the United States now owned the Tikrit operation, said, ""Yes. This was a calculated risk, but it's one that had to be taken."" Both officials spoke on grounds of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.Together, the four Shiite groups that objected to the American air role already represent more than a third of the 30,000 fighters on the government side in the offensive against the Islamic State, analysts said.""We don't trust the American-led coalition in combating ISIS,"" said Naeem al-Uboudi, the spokesman for Asaib Ahl al-Haq, one of the three groups which said it would withdraw from the front line around Tikrit. ""In the past, they have targeted our security forces and dropped aid to ISIS by mistake,"" he said.One of the leaders of the biggest militias in the fight, the Badr Organization, also criticized the American role and said his group, too, might pull out.""We don't need the American-led coalition to participate in Tikrit. Tikrit is an easy battle, we can win it ourselves,"" said Mueen al-Kadhumi, who is one of the Shiite militia group's top commanders.""We have not yet decided if we will pull out or not,"" he said. The Badr Organization's leader, Hadi al-Ameri, was shown on Iraqi television leading the ground fight in Tikrit on Thursday.The office of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced Thursday night that he went personally to Tikrit, presumably to persuade Mr. Ameri to keep his fighters in the field.The Badr Organization fields the largest cohesive ground force in the conflict, and its withdrawal from Tikrit would be potentially catastrophic, according to Wafiq al-Hashimi, the head of the Iraqi Group for Strategic Studies.""Dr. Abadi rushed into this decision to liberate Tikrit with the Americans without taking time to work out a compromise among all these groups and the Americans, most of whom have a lot of disputes with the Americans,"" Mr. Hashimi said.Another Iranian-aligned Shiite militia group reacted with defiance and threats against the Americans.""We are staying in Tikrit, we are not leaving and we are going to target the American-led coalition in Tikrit and their creation, ISIS,"" said Akram al-Kabi, the leader of the Nujabaa Brigade, a powerful militia that has previously sent fighters to Syria on behalf of the Bashir al-Assad government there.His remarks raised the possibility that the group would use antiaircraft fire against coalition warplanes, using Iraqi fighting positions.On Thursday night, an airstrike on the village of Alvu Ajeel, on the edge of Tikrit, killed six Shiite militiamen, as well as three federal policemen, one of them a colonel, according to a spokesman for the Iraqi military's Salahuddin Operations Command. The strike was thought to have been carried out by the United States.The spokesman, who would not give his name because of official policy, described it as a ""friendly fire"" episode.A Pentagon spokesman said he could not confirm the event. ""We review all allegations and investigate those found credible,"" said Col. Steve Warren, director of Defense Press Operations.It was not known if the militiamen who were killed in the friendly fire episode belonged to Al Nujabaa or another group.The American airstrikes in Tikrit began late on Wednesday night and continued for eight and a half hours, subsiding at dawn on Thursday, when Iraq's handful of Russian-made fighter jets took over from this base on the outskirts of Baghdad and further bombed Tikrit in a succession of daytime raids, Iraqi officials said.The other groups that announced they would boycott the Tikrit operation were Qatab Hizbullah, which like Asaib Ahl al-Haq is closely aligned and supported by Iran, and the Peace Brigade, the latest name for a militia made of up followers of the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, previously known as the Mahdi Army.Mr. Sadr, whose troops fought bitter battles against the Americans during much of the Iraq war, said his group was pulling out because, ""The participation of the so-called international alliance is to protect ISIS on the one hand, and to confiscate the achievements of the Iraqis on the other hand.""Since March 2, Islamic State forces in Tikrit have been under attack by the Iraqi militias, collectively known as the Popular Mobilization Committees, and regular Iraqi military forces, accompanied at times by Iranian military advisers.Still, a much smaller force of Islamic State fighters has been able to hold them off in a few areas of the city for almost four weeks.In recent days, despite the claims of self-sufficiency made by militia commanders, Iraqi military officials said American airstrikes were needed to break the deadlock.The militias who were withdrawing did not say they were quitting their positions in the Tikrit area altogether, or in adjoining areas of Salahuddin Province, just returning to their nearby bases and boycotting the front-line advance.Staff Gen. Anwer Hamid, the commander of the Iraqi Air Force, said that the American airstrikes would continue, with Americans concentrating their attacks during the night for operational reasons.""Their role in this fighting is very important to us,"" he said. ""They have a high number of aircraft and they have good capabilities, they can really help us.""",1.0
Sudan Joins Coalition Against Yemen Rebels:   [Foreign Desk ],,"UNITED NATIONS -- It is an awkward moment.The Arab-led, American-supported coalition seeking to rout Houthi rebels in Yemen includes a man indicted on charges of war crimes and vilified by Washington for more than a decade: President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan.Mr. Bashir's government has said it will join the military offensive to aid its ally, Saudi Arabia, according to reports by the state-owned news agency, perhaps even sending ground troops.In a sign of Sudan's growing ties with Persian Gulf countries, Mr. Bashir met with King Salman of Saudi Arabia on a visit to the kingdom this week, and he is expected to take part in the Arab League summit meeting in Cairo this weekend.Mr. Bashir was in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el Sheikh in mid-March to speak at an investment conference. Secretary of State John Kerry attended that conference, too, but left the audience for a few minutes when Mr. Bashir took the podium.Mr. Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on genocide charges in connection with the conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan.

Egypt is not a member of the court.""Given Sudan's atrocious track record in complying with the laws of war,"" said Philippe Bolopion of Human Rights Watch, the country's ""participation in the Saudi-led coalition only heightens already vivid concerns about the price Yemeni civilians might pay in the course of these military operations.""Photograph Omar Hassan Al-Bashir",1.0
"Opening New Iraq Front, U.S. Strikes ISIS in Tikrit:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDED. BAGHDAD -- American warplanes began airstrikes against Islamic State positions in Tikrit late Wednesday, finally joining a stalled offensive to retake the Iraqi city as American officials sought to seize the initiative from Iran, which had taken a major role in directing the operation.The decision to directly aid the offensive was made by President Obama on Wednesday, American officials said, and represented a significant shift in the Iraqi campaign. For more than three weeks, the Americans had stayed on the sideline of the battle for Tikrit, wary of being in the position of aiding an essentially Iranian-led operation. Senior Iranian officials had been on the scene, and allied Shiite militias had made up the bulk of the force.Mr. Obama approved the airstrikes after a request from Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on the condition that Iranian-backed Shiite militias move aside to allow a larger role for Iraqi government counterterrorism forces that have worked most closely with United States troops, American officials said. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps who has been advising forces around Tikrit, was reported on Sunday to have left the area.The United States has struggled to maintain influence in Iraq, even as Iran has helped direct the war on the ground against the Islamic State. But as the struggles to take Tikrit mounted, with a small band of Islamic State militants holding out against a combined Iraqi force of more than 30,000 for weeks, American officials saw a chance not only to turn the momentum against the Islamic State but to gain an edge against the Iranians.If the Americans did not engage, they feared becoming marginalized by Tehran in a country where they had spilled much blood in the last decade, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.American officials now hope that an American-assisted victory by Mr. Abadi and his forces will politically bolster him and counter the view of Iranian officials, and many Iraqi Shiites, that Iran is Iraq's vital ally. ""Taking back Tikrit is important, but it gives us an opportunity to have our half of the operation win this one,"" one American official said. ""It's somewhat of a gamble.""The administration also hopes that a Tikrit victory with American air power will ensure that it is their coalition with Mr. Abadi's forces, and not the faction led by Mr. Suleimani, that then proceeds to try to recapture the larger and more pivotal city of Mosul.But by most accounts, such an operation is months in the future, at least, as officials and analysts agree the assembled force around Tikrit would be inadequate to take Mosul. Officials are scrambling to train more Iraqi soldiers for a push on Mosul, and especially to include more Sunni Arab forces in the offensive. Tikrit and Mosul are heavily Sunni cities, and there are widespread concerns that using predominantly Shiite forces in the campaigns could lead to sectarian abuses. Further, it is not clear that Mr. Abadi has the political strength or will to keep reining in the militiamen or Iran's influence, both which have powerful sway in his Shiite political coalition.The White House made no comment and instead left it to the Pentagon to announce the new airstrikes against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. ""These strikes are intended to destroy ISIL strongholds with precision, thereby saving innocent Iraqi lives while minimizing collateral damage to infrastructure,"" Lt. Gen. James L. Terry, the commander of the Islamic State operation, said in a statement. ""This will further enable Iraqi forces under Iraqi command to maneuver and defeat ISIL in the vicinity of Tikrit.""Mr. Abadi hailed the strikes in a speech broadcast on Iraqi state television from Baghdad on Wednesday night. ""The time of freedom has just been started,"" he said. He continued, ""We announce today what we have promised you yesterday, that we are going to liberate and clear each spot of our territory, and ISIS won't have a foothold on Iraq's land.""But Shiite militia figures have criticized any outreach toward the United States. ""Some of the weaklings in the army say that we need the Americans, but we say we do not need the Americans,"" Hadi al-Ameri, the prominent leader of the group of Shiite militias known here as popular mobilization committees, said last week.The battle for Tikrit, an important city north of Baghdad in Iraq's Sunni heartland, has powerful resonance because its capture last year was seen as a sign of the Islamic State's ascendance. Complete control of Tikrit would give Iraqi forces command of a vital cluster of road networks and would be the first major success in rolling back last year's lightning offensive that brought Islamic State forces within a short drive from the capital.The offensive began March 2, with officials making repeated claims that the city would be reclaimed within days. Then in recent days, officials have said they preferred to consolidate their gains rather than risk more civilian casualties by continuing to press their attack.The preponderance of the 30,000 fighters on the Iraqi side have been members of the militias, fighting alongside Iraqi soldiers and policemen. The Iraqi government has tried to broaden the offensive to include more Sunnis, but the force remains largely Shiite.At Friday Prayer in Karbala last week, a sermon by Sheikh Abdul Mehdi al-Karbalaee, a representative of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the powerful spiritual leader of Iraq's Shiites, pointedly called for more unity and better organization in the fight in Tikrit. That was widely taken as implicit criticism of the offensive's lack of success.The representative also said that fighters should refrain from flying Shiite religious banners, suggesting that better efforts should be made to involve Sunnis in the fight.Last Sunday, Mr. Ameri, the militia organizer, praised Mr. Suleimani, the Iranian commander, for his help in Tikrit but said that he had left the area. ""Qassem Suleimani is here whenever we need him,"" Mr. Ameri said at a news conference at Camp Ashraf, a militia base north of Baghdad. ""He was giving very good advice. The battle ended now, and he returned to his operational headquarters.""Mr. Abadi asked the ambassador Stuart E. Jones and Brett McGurk, the deputy special envoy for the battle with the Islamic State, for American help with the Tikrit offensive last week. The American side insisted that it could help only if operations were coordinated by a joint center with the American military in Baghdad and if there were clear targets.The Americans wanted to work with Iraqi forces they had helped train and insisted on ""deconflicting"" with the Iranian-backed militias so they would not bomb them by mistake, American officials said. The Shiite militias have generally been on the east side of the Tigris River, the officials said, so it should be possible to avoid any errors.Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke with Mr. Abadi by telephone, and Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, the head of Central Command, developed a plan for strikes and concluded that the Iraqis had met the Americans' condition, the officials said. Although Mr. Obama does not personally sign off on most airstrikes in the fight with the Islamic State, he was brought this decision for approval because it represented a more complicated shift in policy.American officials seemed heartened that Mr. Abadi had made a point of calling the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey last weekend to reassure them that once the Islamic State is rooted out of Tikrit, the Sunni city would be returned to the control of its Sunni police, not dominated by Shiite forces.But even the addition of American air power did not guarantee victory. Although the Islamic State has a relatively small force in Tikrit, American officials said they had booby-trapped many of the houses, and an all-out raid to drive them out could be costly.""It's a pretty gnarly situation for anybody going in there,"" one of the officials said.",1.0
Saudis Hit Yemen With Air Assault:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Saudi Arabia announced on Wednesday night that it had launched a military campaign in Yemen, the beginning of what a Saudi official said was an offensive to restore a Yemeni government that had collapsed after rebel forces took control of large swaths of the country.The air campaign began as the internal conflict in Yemen showed signs of degenerating into a proxy war between regional powers. The Saudi announcement came during a rare news conference in Washington by Adel al-Jubeir, the kingdom's ambassador to the United States.Mr. Jubeir said that the Saudis were part of a coalition of approximately 10 nations determined to blunt the advance of Shiite Houthi rebels, who have overrun Yemen's capital and forced the American-backed government into a full retreat.""We will do whatever it takes to protect the legitimate government of Yemen,"" said Mr. Jubeir, who spoke to reporters shortly after the air campaign had begun.Mr. Jubeir did not name the other countries involved in the military campaign, but said the coalition included other Persian Gulf nations. He said that American military forces were not involved in the airstrikes, but that the Saudis had consulted ""very closely"" with the Obama administration before launching the offensive.The Saudi-led campaign began as fighters and army units allied with the Houthi movement threatened to overrun the southern port of Aden, where the besieged president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has gone into hiding.Yemen shares a long border with Saudi Arabia, a major American ally, and the Saudis had been reported to be massing forces on the Yemen frontier as Mr. Hadi's last redoubt in Aden looked increasingly imperiled.The rapid advances by the president's opponents included the seizure of a military air base and an aerial assault on his home. There were unconfirmed reports that the president had fled the country by boat for Djibouti, the tiny Horn of Africa nation across the Gulf of Aden.The region's most impoverished country, Yemen has been a central theater of the American fight against Al Qaeda, and its possible collapse presents complex challenges to the Obama administration as it struggles to deal with instability and radical extremism in the Middle East. In 2011, the Central Intelligence Agency built a base in the southern desert of Saudi Arabia to launch drone strikes in Yemen.Along with Syria, Iraq and Libya, Yemen is now the fourth state to veer toward political disintegration in the aftermath of the Arab Spring revolts, which first erupted four years ago.By Wednesday morning, Houthi forces had seized Al Anad air base, which until recently had been used by American counterterrorism forces, about 35 miles from Mr. Hadi's refuge in Aden, the country's second-largest city.A television network under Houthi control said the rebel forces had found the base empty and looted, and had captured two senior officers loyal to Mr. Hadi, including his defense minister. A security official of Mr. Hadi's government confirmed the loss of Al Anad.Yemeni Air Force planes under Houthi control also struck targets near the president's Aden home, and his supporters returned fire with antiaircraft guns. The state television network, also controlled by Houthis, announced a $100,000 bounty for Mr. Hadi's arrest as rumors about his whereabouts swirled. By nightfall, there were reports that Houthi forces were fighting around the Aden airport, on the outskirts of the city.Shortly after the Saudi strikes began, witnesses in Sana, the capital, reported that bombing had begun at the airport and that electrical power had been cut.A spokeswoman for the National Security Council said Wednesday night that the United States was providing intelligence and logistical support for the campaign in Yemen, and that President Obama had authorized a ""joint planning cell"" with Saudi Arabia to coordinate American support for the military offensive.Mr. Hadi's foreign minister reiterated his calls for intervention by Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other Arab states to stop the Houthis, stoking fears that their advance could set off a widening conflict.The country appeared to be sliding toward a civil war as dangerous as any in the region, with elements of a sectarian feud, a regional proxy conflict, the attempted return of an ousted authoritarian and the expansion of anti-Western extremist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State that are eager to capitalize on the chaos.The Houthis, a minority religious group from northern Yemen, practice a variant of Shiite Islam and receive support from Iran. But they are also collaborating with Yemeni security forces still loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the longtime strongman who was pushed from power amid the Arab Spring uprising but now appears to be orchestrating a comeback in alliance with the Houthis.With Mr. Saleh's help, the Houthis now control most of the Yemeni military, including its air force. That has given them a decisive advantage over Mr. Hadi's forces, as their seizure of the air base on Wednesday made clear.But their ability to control and govern their expanding territory remains far from clear. ""I would not be surprised if we see Aden falling to the Houthis tomorrow,"" said Ibrahim Sharqieh, deputy director of the Brookings Doha Center. ""But that will just set the stage for a prolonged conflict or civil war, because the Houthis have not been able to maintain order even in the areas they have controlled since last year.""Mr. Hadi was installed as a replacement for Mr. Saleh in a transition brokered by Persian Gulf monarchies, and he has the backing of both Saudi Arabia and Washington. But he fled to Aden from Sana after the Houthis captured it months ago. His last vestiges of support and protection appeared to be only a small number of military units and some tribal groups based in the predominantly Sunni Muslim south.As Mr. Hadi's opponents have cornered him, his supporters have escalated calls for Saudi Arabia, the other Persian Gulf states and Egypt to intervene to hold back the Houthis, portraying them as an arm of Iran.Saudi Arabia has fought military battles in Yemen before. In 1934, Ibn Saud, the founder of the Saudi kingdom, fought Yemen's king, Iman Yahya, in what was essentially a dispute over territory in the mountainous region along the coast of the Red Sea.Saudi Arabia was drawn into another conflict against the Houthis in 2009, at that time intervening in support of Mr. Saleh. The fighting had lasted only a few months, but the Saudi military suffered more than 130 casualties, leading many analysts to conclude that the Saudis would resist a repeat of the experience in another war against the Houthis.At the Arab League on Wednesday, officials said that Yemen would top the agenda at a meeting this week in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt.Against the backdrop of the escalating conflict, Sunni Muslim extremists pledging allegiance to both Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have been escalating their attacks, including sectarian assaults on the Houthis. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed responsibility for two bombings of Shiite mosques in Sana on Friday that killed more than 135 people. Al Qaeda's affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, already effectively controls pockets of southern Yemen beyond the reach of either Mr. Hadi or the Houthis.The United States evacuated its military personnel from Al Anad several days ago, as fighters from Al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate moved closer from one side and Houthi fighters pushed closer from the other. About 100 American personnel, including Special Forces commandos, were reportedly stationed there before the evacuation.",1.0
Dozens Are Reported Killed as Saudi-Led Strike Hits Camp for Displaced Yemeni Civilians:   [Foreign Desk ],,"AL MUKALLA, Yemen -- Dozens of civilians were killed when, according to aid workers and officials, what appeared to be an airstrike hit a camp for displaced families in northern Yemen on Monday. It was thought to be the deadliest single episode involving civilians since Saudi Arabia began a military campaign to drive back the Houthi movement five days earlier.The deaths, in the Al-Mazraq camp, came as the Saudi-led Arab military coalition intensified attacks across Yemen, bombing multiple targets including a missile depot in the capital, Sana, that erupted in a nighttime conflagration and sent civilians in a nearby village fleeing the explosions, according to witnesses.Saudi officials have framed their military offensive as an effort to roll back the gains of the Houthis, whose fighters have seized control of much of Yemen over the last seven months, and to restore to power the exiled government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The Saudi offensive has been primarily driven by a fear of Iranian influence in the region: the Houthis, who practice a strain of Shiite Islam and are supported by Iran, have been accused by Saudi officials as acting as an Iranian proxy force.Yet the military action, which has come with the threat of a ground invasion by Saudi and other Arab troops, has raised concerns that it will only further destabilize Yemen, the region's most impoverished country as well as a haven for a powerful Al Qaeda affiliate.Already, the chaos has caused the Obama administration to withdraw its last remaining counterterrorism advisers from Yemen. As the Saudi-led coalition has tightened its military grip on the country -- restricting access by sea and air, while widening its airstrikes -- there are growing fears of a humanitarian emergency, according to aid workers.In Riyadh, the Saudi capital, a spokesman for the military coalition told reporters that naval forces were blocking the movement of ships to thwart weapons and fighters from entering or leaving. Al Ahram, the main Egyptian state newspaper, said warships from Egypt, part of the Saudi coalition, were shelling Houthi fighters to stop their advance into Aden, the southern port that is one of the last refuges of fighters loyal to Mr. Hadi.By nighttime, huge explosions were seen rocking Sana, in what witnesses described as Saudi airstrikes on caches of missiles in a military base on a mountain -- presumably to prevent the Houthis from using them. Images of fireballs from the bombings were posted on Twitter and other social media forums. It was not immediately clear whether the blasts caused any casualties.Earlier in the day, Saudi jets seeking out gatherings of Houthi fighters apparently missed their targets and hit the Al-Mazraq displaced-persons camp, said a senior security official in the area, Saleh Al Mougbili. International relief agencies at the camp also described the attack as an airstrike.There was no comment from Saudi Arabia on the Al-Mazraq bombing, which caused at least 31 deaths, by Mr. Mougbili's account. The International Organization for Migration, which had field workers at the camp, said at least 40 people were killed, mostly civilians. Dozens were wounded, according to the organization and Doctors Without Borders, which treated victims.""People in Al-Mazraq camp have been living in very harsh conditions since 2009, and now they have suffered the consequences of an airstrike on the camp,"" Pablo Marco, the Doctors Without Borders operational manager for Yemen, said in a statement.Al-Mazraq, in Hajja Province, was established in 2001 by the United Nations and has housed hundreds of families whose lives have been upended by the country's chronic conflicts. The camp houses about 5,000 people, said Joel A. Millman, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, a Geneva-based humanitarian group.""We are trying to learn more about the victims, whether all are Yemeni, whether any are aid workers, and so on,"" Mr. Millman said in an emailed statement.The Saudi-backed Yemeni government, which has largely been driven from power, its top officials in exile, denied that any coalition airstrike had been carried out on the camp.The Yemeni foreign minister, Riyadh Yaseen, was quoted by Reuters as saying in Saudi Arabia that explosions at the camp had been caused by artillery strikes from Houthi fighters.At least two other strikes from Saudi jets on Monday may also have missed their intended targets, hitting a gathering of anti-Houthi tribesmen in the southern province of Shabwa, killing three, local tribal leaders said.",1.0
Saudis Make Own Moves as U.S. and Iran Talk:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. CAIRO -- As America talks to Iran, Saudi Arabia is lashing out against it.The kingdom, Iran's chief regional rival, is leading airstrikes against an Iranian-backed faction in Yemen; backing a blitz in Idlib, Syria, by jihadists fighting the Iranian-backed Assad regime; and warning Washington not to allow the Iranian-backed militia to capture too much of Iraq during the fight to roll back the Islamic State, according to Arab diplomats familiar with the talks.Through Egypt, a major beneficiary of Saudi aid, the kingdom is backing plans for a combined Arab military force to combat Iranian influence around the region. With another major aid recipient, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia is also expected to step up its efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, potentially setting off an arms race in the region.All this comes just a few weeks after the death of King Abdullah and the passing of the throne to a new ruler, King Salman, who then installed his son Mohammed, who is 29 or 30, in the powerful dual roles of defense minister and chief of the royal court.""Taking matters into our own hands is the name of the game today,"" said Jamal Khashoggi, a veteran Saudi journalist and former adviser to the government. ""A deal will open up the Saudi appetite and the Turkish appetite for more nuclear programs. But for the time being Saudi Arabia is moving ahead with its operations to pull the carpet out from underneath the Iranians in our region.""With the approach of a self-imposed Tuesday night deadline for the framework of a nuclear deal between Iran and the Western powers, the talks themselves are already changing the dynamics of regional politics.The proposed deal would trade relief from economic sanctions on Iran for insurance against the risk that Iran might rapidly develop a nuclear bomb. But many Arab analysts and diplomats say that security against the nuclear risk may come at the cost of worsening ongoing conflicts around the Middle East as Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Muslim allies push back against what they see as efforts by Shiite-led Iran to impose its influence -- often on sectarian battle lines.Unless Iran pulls back, ""you will see more direct Arab responses and you will see a higher level of geopolitical tension in the whole region,"" argued Nabil Fahmy, a veteran Egyptian diplomat and former foreign minister.In Yemen, where a bombing campaign by a Saudi-led coalition killed dozens of civilians in an errant strike on a camp for displaced families, the Saudis accuse Iran of supporting the Houthi movement, which follows a form of Shiite Islam and recently came close to taking control of the country's four largest cities. (Western diplomats say Iran has provided money to the group but does not control it.) In Bahrain, across a short causeway from Saudi Arabia, the kingdom and its allies accuse Iran of backing opposition from the Shiite majority against the Sunni monarchy.And Iran has also cultivated clients in government in the great Arab capitals of Damascus, Baghdad and Beirut, the last through its proxy, Hezbollah.Even if the proposed deal constrains Iran's nuclear ambitions, the Saudis and their allies note, the pact would do nothing to stop Iran from projecting its influence through such local proxies and conventional arms. Sanctions relief from the deal could even revive the Iranian economy with a flood of new oil revenues.""The Americans seem nonchalant about this, like, 'This is your sectarian problem, you deal with it,' "" Mr. Khashoggi said. ""So the Saudis went ahead with this Yemen operation.""Watching Secretary of State John Kerry pursue a deal in Lausanne, Switzerland, many in Saudi Arabia and other Arab states say their ultimate fear is that the talks could lead to a broader détente or even alliance between Washington and Tehran.Washington is already tacitly coordinating with Iran in its fight against ISIS in Iraq. As a result, the American-led military campaign is effectively strengthening the Iranian-backed government in Syria by weakening its most dangerous foe, Arab diplomats and analysts say.So they wonder what else Mr. Kerry is talking about with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, ""on those long walks together"" in Lausanne, said Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center, in Qatar. ""Is there something going on underneath the table?""Easing the hostility between the United States and Iran would tear up what has been a bedrock principle of regional politics since the Iranian revolution and the storming of the American embassy in 1979. ""But let's not forget that we are still dealing with the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" Mr. Shaikh said, reflecting the skeptical views of many in the Saudi Arabian camp.""There is a disbelief in the Arab world that these negotiations are only about the nuclear file, and a frequent complaint here is that we are kept in the dark, we are not consulted,"" said Gamal Abdel Gawad Soltan, a political scientist at the American University in Cairo. ""The U.S. is much less trusted as an ally, as an insurance policy towards the security threats facing the governments in the region, and so those governments decide to act on their own.""President Obama has argued that a verifiable deal is the best way to secure the Arab states because it is the most effective way to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear bomb. Even military action to take out Iran's nuclear facilities, the Obama administration argues, would set it back only temporarily.Some analysts further maintain that a nuclear deal could induce Tehran to adopt a less confrontational foreign policy as well, by engaging it in economic and diplomatic relations with the West and, eventually, its neighbors. If Iran were less of a pariah, it would have more to lose, argued Lina Khatib, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. ""An engaged Iran is a less threatening Iran,"" she said. ""I think a nuclear deal with Iran will have a calming impact on the region.""But she acknowledged that at the moment Saudi Arabia and its allies did not see it that way. ""The Saudi and Iranian rivalry is being played out now in a hot war in Iraq, in Syria and now in Yemen,"" she said. ""The confrontation is causing people on both sides to dig into their sectarian positions.""Aversion to the Iran deal in the Saudi camp is also representative of the latest convergence of views with the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been deeply critical of the nuclear pact. But ""they can be on the same side without necessarily talking,"" said Mr. Soltan of the American University in Cairo.Whether an Iran deal is consummated or not, he and several other analysts said, the negotiations have contributed to a divergence with the Obama administration and a growing desire for greater autonomy among the Sunni Arab states.Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies bucked the Obama administration to sponsor the military takeover and repression of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in 2013, for example. And last year the United Arab Emirates carried out airstrikes from Egyptian bases against Islamist allied militias in Tripoli, Libya, without notifying Washington. Some American diplomats were so incredulous that the U.A.E. acted on its own that they doubted early reports until a second set of strikes confirmed them.""There are issues that you cannot expect a superpower to engage in directly because of their own politics and interests, and if you don't have the capabilities or the initiatives to deal with them yourself then you are not providing enough of a deterrent to other regional players,"" said Mr. Fahmy, the former Egyptian foreign minister. He added, speaking of Arab relations with Washington, ""There is a difference between a security relationship and a security addiction.""Mr. Khashoggi, the Saudi editor, argued that Saudi Arabia's own campaign to push back against Iran without waiting for the Americans was showing signs of success. Saudi Arabian and Turkish sponsors, he said, had backed the coalition of jihadist groups that recently captured the Syrian city of Idlib in the first major victory in months against the government of President Bashar al-Assad.One participant in the coalition was the Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of Al Qaeda, a terrorist group in the eyes of the West. But members of the jihadi coalition ""are the ones who captured Idlib, it is an important development, and I think we are going to see more of that,"" Mr. Khashoggi said. ""Coordination between Turkish and Saudi intelligence has never been as good as now.""The after-the-fact American support for the military campaign in Yemen, he said, was also a reassuring sign that Washington was willing to back Saudi leadership as it pushes back against Iran across the region. ""The Americans are going along with that,"" he said.The operation ""proved that a regional power can lead, they do not have to wait for America,"" he said, ""and if the issue is moral or justified, America will get on board.""",1.0
"In Blow to Syrian Insurgents, Airstrike Is Said to Kill Rebel Leader:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The commander of one of the most powerful Syrian insurgent groups in the suburbs of the Syrian capital, Damascus, was killed Friday in an airstrike, according to the government and its opponents. The death of the commander, Zahran Alloush, is a significant blow to the armed opposition, bolstering President Bashar al-Assad ahead of a planned new round of peace talks.Mr. Alloush led the Army of Islam, a group that had recently agreed to participate in a political process seeking to end the five-year-old conflict. The Army of Islam is regarded by the Syrian government and its most powerful ally, Russia, as a sectarian, terrorist group that differs little from more extremist groups like the Islamic State.Local opposition figures reached in Damascus said the airstrikes had been carried out by Russian warplanes, but that information was not immediately confirmed by Russian or Syrian officials.Analysts said the strikes were in keeping with longstanding efforts by the Syrian government and its allies to eliminate groups claiming to occupy a middle ground between Mr. Assad and the Islamic State. The efforts are part of a broader objective to improve Mr. Assad's standing among Western governments, which despise him but also see the Islamic State as an increasing menace.The Army of Islam sent members to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, this month for talks among opposition groups aimed at choosing representatives for a third round of international peace talks, scheduled for early 2016.Mr. Alloush and his faction had not been universally accepted in the Syrian opposition -- they are widely blamed for the disappearance of four secular opposition activists from the Damascus suburb of Douma. But unlike harder-line armed groups, the Army of Islam has shown a recent interest in taking part in politics, said Ibrahim Hamidi, a Syrian correspondent for Al Hayat, a pan-Arab newspaper.Mr. Hamidi, who opposes the Syrian government, said that by having successfully targeted Mr. Alloush, Mr. Assad and his Russian allies had demonstrated their desire to pursue a military solution. ""This is a rejection of the Riyadh talks,"" he said.The Army of Islam controls much of the urban sprawl east of Damascus known as East Ghouta, an area that has been under blockade and bombardment by government forces for the better part of four years.Government supporters welcomed Mr. Alloush's death, blaming him for periodic shelling of civilian areas in Damascus. Government opponents said he had been instrumental in restraining more extremist groups from unleashing worse attacks on the city.The opponents also argue that the Army of Islam, which sees the Islamic State as an enemy and competitor, has been crucial in keeping that group from encroaching closer to Damascus, and that weakening it could open the door to advances by the fighters of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL.The Army of Islam could be particularly vulnerable because it was organized around a single charismatic individual, more so than many other rebel groups.""Big day for supporters of ISIS and the Assad regime,"" Hassan Hassan, a co-author of ""ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror,"" posted on Twitter, adding that Mr. Alloush's group was ""without a doubt one of the very earliest"" of Syrian insurgent movements ""to systematically fight ISIS & its cells.""At the same time, Mr. Alloush had enemies and critics among fellow opponents of the government. Some insurgents have long accused him of making lucrative deals with the government or hoarding Saudi-supplied arms rather than using them to help overmatched insurgents in other areas around Damascus.Mr. Alloush, a religiously conservative Sunni Muslim, had a history of making sectarian statements. But after having met with American officials recently, he softened his tone.In interviews with the McClatchy news service he denounced sectarian or partisan rule of Syria, and said he believed that the country should be governed by a ""technocratic, professional"" body.His faction had allowed a group of secular activists from Damascus, including Razan Zeitouneh, an award-winning human rights lawyer, to be based in Douma, but in 2013 they were kidnapped after having criticized the Army of Islam.Mr. Alloush recently denied that his group had been behind their disappearance, but his death leaves friends of the missing activists concerned that they have lost their main channel for recovering them.The strike on Mr. Alloush -- which activists said took place as he met with another insurgent group, Ahrar al-Sham -- came as Islamic State fighters prepared to evacuate from the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk, south of Damascus, in a deal involving the government, the Islamic State, other Syrian insurgent groups, Palestinian factions and the United Nations.The details of the deal remained unclear, but part of the objective was to allow some civilians to leave the camp and to increase humanitarian access to it. Thousands of people face severe hunger and unsanitary conditions in the camp, which has long been besieged.The deal also was said to involve safe passage for Islamic State fighters inside Yarmouk to the group's headquarters in Raqqa in eastern Syria.",1.0
,,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- Besieged Afghan forces were struggling to head off a complete Taliban takeover of the critical southern district of Sangin on Tuesday, and a new deployment of British troops was rushed in to help direct an increasingly pressed battle across the surrounding province of Helmand.A small contingent of British forces in an advisory role arrived at Camp Shorabak, the largest British military base in Afghanistan before it was handed over to the Afghan forces last year, Britain's Defense Ministry said in a statement.""They are not deployed in a combat role and will not deploy outside the camp,"" the statement said.The new deployment, which Afghan officials said included about 40 people, was in addition to an influx of American Special Operations forces that deployed to Helmand when the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, was on the verge of falling several weeks ago.The Western deployment comes as Sangin, a Taliban stronghold for years, appeared close to a complete takeover by the Taliban after weeks of heavy fighting there and in neighboring districts.Ebadullah Alizai, a member of the provincial council in Helmand, said much of the Sangin district center was under Taliban control, with an Afghan Army unit surrounded and in urgent need of reinforcements.But attempts to get the extra troops to Sangin were being slowed by roadside bombs, he said.Sangin has been one of the deadliest Afghan battlegrounds for British and American troops throughout the war. Within months of the NATO transfer of security control to Afghan forces there, the district began coming under heavy insurgent pressure.The Afghan forces have been mostly penned into their bases there over the past year. But in recent weeks, the situation became even worse, as police forces began taking witheringly heavy casualties, Afghan officials said. By Tuesday, the remaining police contingent and members of the civilian government had retreated from the district center and were surrounded at an army base about two miles away, said Abdul Bashir Shakir, head of the security committee at the provincial council.""The reinforcements have been sent, but heavy I.E.D.s about four kilometers from the district center stopped their approach,"" Mr. Shakir said.Still, officials said there were no coalition forces in Sangin itself, as they were focused on assisting the broader fight across Helmand Province.The Taliban has made huge strides in its Helmand offensive this year. For months, Afghan forces have been struggling to repel Taliban advances across several districts, including Khan Neshin, Gereshk, Marja, Kajaki and Washir. The insurgents have made it as close as three miles from Lashkar Gah, in the suburb of Babaji, where fighting has gone on for weeks.""We have severe challenges in 13 districts, only Garmsir and Nawa districts are calm at the moment,"" Mr. Alizai said.The largest province in Afghanistan in terms of territory, Helmand holds great symbolic value both to the Taliban and the Afghan government and its Western backers.It was at the heart of President Obama's troop surge after he took office, where fresh American forces and resources were rushed in to try to break the Taliban's hold. British troops also fought bloody battles there, suffering some of their worst casualties.For the Taliban, Helmand is a crucial prize because of its resources. The province produces the biggest opium poppy harvest in Afghanistan, and its deserts fall right on the lucrative trafficking route that the Taliban have increasingly exploited. One of Afghanistan's biggest marble mines is also in Helmand, with the Taliban profiting from the royalties.The province shares a long and fluid border with Pakistan, where most of the Taliban's senior leadership lives. Some Afghan officials believe the insurgents have pushed harder for Helmand this year specifically to create a haven and operational headquarters in Afghanistan, allowing their leaders to come back into the country.Much of the Helmand offensive has been waged by fighters loyal to Mullah Qayum Zakir, a former Guantánamo Bay inmate who is considered one of the architects of the Taliban resurgence and is a leading rival to the new Taliban supreme leader, Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour.Even as the Taliban's southern offensive has gained ground, so have their military pushes in eastern Afghanistan, and in the north as well, where they briefly occupied the provincial capital of Kunduz in September.The broad pattern of fighting has desperately stretched the Afghan forces in a year when NATO air support was wound down with the end of the formal combat mission in 2014, Afghan officials say.",1.0
Turkey Moves to Clamp Down on Its Borders:   [Foreign Desk ],,"IZMIR, Turkey -- The Turkish Coast Guard has stepped up nighttime patrols on the choppy, wintry waters of the Aegean Sea, seizing rafts full of refugees fleeing war for Europe and sending them back to Turkey.Down south, at the border with Syria, Turkey is building a concrete wall, digging trenches, laying razor wire and at night illuminating vast stretches of land in an effort to cut off the flow of supplies and foreign fighters to the Islamic State.On land and at sea, Turkey's borders, long a revolving door of refugees, foreign fighters and the smugglers who enable them, are at the center of two separate yet interlinked global crises: the migrant tide convulsing Europe and the Syrian civil war that propels it.Accused by Western leaders of turning a blind eye to these critical borders, Turkey at last seems to be getting serious about shoring them up. Under growing pressure from Europe and the United States, Turkey has in recent weeks taken steps to cut off the flows of refugees and of foreign fighters who have helped destabilize a vast portion of the globe, from the Middle East to Europe.Smugglers who used to make a living helping the Islamic State bring foreign fighters into Syria say that it is increasingly difficult -- though still not impossible -- to do so now. Border guards who once fired warning shots, they say, now shoot to kill.""Whoever approaches the border is shot,"" said Omar, a smuggler interviewed in the border town of Kilis who insisted on being identified by only his first name because of the illegal nature of his work. ""And many have been killed.""Another smuggler, Mustafa, who also agreed to speak if only his first name was used, said, ""Two months ago, you could get in whatever you liked."" He said he used to bring in explosives and foreign fighters for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. That allowed him to continue his regular business of smuggling food and other items, like cigarettes, into Syria. Now, he said, ""the Turkish snipers shoot any moving object.""At the coast, Turkey's efforts to interdict more boats full of migrants came after the European Union agreed to pay Ankara more than $3 billion to help with education and health care for the refugees in the country.Some rights groups have cried foul. Amnesty International recently accused Turkey of illegally detaining migrants and, in some cases, of sending them back to war zones. Turkish officials have said they detain relatively few migrants, and only ones they say have links to smuggling rings.The Basmane neighborhood of this coastal city, the primary hub for migrants on their way to Europe, is quieter than it was during the summer -- not primarily because of any new toughness by the Turks, but because fewer migrants will risk a sea crossing during the winter, when the waters are rougher. Smugglers' fees have lately dropped to as low as $500 per person from about $1,200 because of the lower demand.On a recent afternoon here, Bilal Barghoud, a 19-year-old Syrian, sat in a dingy guesthouse. Scrawled on the wall, in Arabic, was, ""We have vests and inner tubes,"" and, ""Tea for 1 Turkish lira."" Mr. Barghoud had just returned from a harrowing night at sea.The trip began smoothly, he said, but as they drew closer to Greece, the waves grew higher. Then, just a few minutes from the beaches of Greece, a Turkish Coast Guard cutter appeared.""Everyone was saying, 'Oh, in 10 minutes we'll be in Greece,' "" he said. ""And then that ship showed up. Everyone was afraid.""The Turks brought them back to the port and also confiscated their life jackets.Now, he said, they were waiting for a new night and another shot at crossing to Greece. Their wait was not long. The next morning, having successfully evaded the Turks, they were safely on the shores of Europe.American and European leaders have complained for years that Turkey's border policy inflamed the Syrian civil war and enabled the rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State. Determined to see the overthrow of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, it allowed a virtually free flow of weapons and fighters across its lands.Turkish officials have rejected such criticism, often blaming Western ""Islamophobia"" and European governments' treatment of their own Muslim populations for the copious flow of foreigners passing through Turkey to join the Islamic State.While American officials say Turkey has improved in numerous ways -- for instance, it has created a watch list of 26,000 terrorism suspects and established a new agency to monitor it -- they are still pressuring the country to do more.As Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter flew to Turkey recently to push officials to do more in the fight against the Islamic State, he said of the country, ""The single most important contribution that their geography makes necessary is the control of their own border.""In recent weeks, the United States has increased airstrikes on the last stretch of Islamic State-held territory along the Turkish border: a 61-mile strip of land west of the Euphrates River. This is the area where last summer the United States and Turkey spoke publicly of a deal to clear the area of the Islamic State, but the two sides disagreed on what to call it -- the Americans said ""ISIS-free zone"" and the Turks a ""safe zone"" -- and the idea seemed to fade.Now, after the recent Islamic State-inspired terrorist attacks in France and the United States, the two countries have renewed cooperative efforts to seal that final stretch.Despite the Turkish crackdown, foreign fighters are still able to reach the Islamic State. According to a recent report by the Soufan Group, a political risk firm based in New York, the Islamic State now has from 27,000 to 31,000 foreign fighters, more than double the estimate the firm published in June 2013.Richard Barrett, senior vice president at the Soufan Group, said that while the Turks were doing a lot more, there were still effective smuggling routes for the Islamic State. He said there were some reports that the group faced a shortage of manpower, but nevertheless the numbers of foreign fighters show that ""they are still able to get people in.""With 2.2 million Syrians, and tens of thousands more Iraqis, Turkey hosts more refugees than any other country. But as it has moved to clamp down on its southern border, critics say it has also closed its doors to new refugees. Many of these are currently fleeing Russian airstrikes in rebel-held areas of Syria and finding themselves trapped by Turkey's closed doors.Now, to reach safety, these refugees say, they have to be smuggled multiple times: from Islamic State-held areas to rebel territory, and then to Turkey, before they even consider the sea journey to Europe. Omar, the smuggler, said that thousands of desperate Syrians would cross in to Turkey if it reopened its border crossings.Turkish officials, though, say that the country's policy toward refugees has not changed.""We will still keep our open-door policy,"" said a senior Turkish official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. ""But obviously the security situation on the ground changed.""As refugees here wait to leave, they worry about the rough seas and the Turkish Coast Guard, but also about how they will be treated, as Muslims, in Europe in the aftermath of the Paris attacks.""In Europe, as Muslims, we will be treated badly,"" said Amir Kuatbi, who left Damascus, Syria's capital, in recent weeks to escape army conscription and who was hoping to reach Sweden. But in Turkey, he said, ""there is no future.""He chose Europe, and the day after he spoke, he arrived in Greece, on his way to Sweden.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

U.S. Troops Sent to Syria to Aid Forces Fighting ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- President Obama announced on Friday that he had ordered several dozen Special Operations troops into Syria for the first open-ended mission by United States ground forces in that country, deepening American involvement in a war he has tried to avoid for more than four years.While the deployment was small in scale, it was large in importance for a president who had refused to commit American ground forces inside Syria beyond quick raids. White House officials said the troops would advise local forces fighting the Islamic State and not play a direct combat role, but they left open the possibility of sending more in the future.The escalation came just weeks after Russia inserted itself into the multisided civil war to support President Bashar al-Assad, bombing opposition forces, including some supported by the United States. Although not characterized as a response, the dispatch of American troops further complicates a kaleidoscopic battlefield with varied forces and sometimes murky allegiances.The move was meant to bolster diplomatic efforts by Secretary of State John Kerry, who on Friday reached an agreement in Vienna with countries with opposing stakes to explore ""a nationwide cease-fire"" and ask the United Nations to oversee the revision of the Syrian Constitution and then new elections. The accord represented the first time all the major outside participants had agreed on the start of a political process to bring the war to an end.But a truce remained elusive and the president's military move was the latest incremental step into the expanding conflict in Syria and next-door Iraq. Once intent on just using American airpower to help local forces on the ground, Mr. Obama has now sent 3,500 American troops to Iraq. An American soldier was killed in a commando raid last week, the first such casualty since the fight against the Islamic State began last year.The troops heading to Syria will number ""fewer than 50,"" the White House said, but Pentagon officials said even those numbers would be useful in coordinating efforts with Kurdish forces. Republicans argued it was too little and too late to make a meaningful difference, while some Democrats said it pushed the United States further down a slippery slope into a hopeless war.The White House insisted this was not a case of mission creep. ""The mission has not changed,"" said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. ""These forces,"" he added, ""do not have a combat mission.""""The responsibility that they have is not to lead the charge to take a hill, but rather to offer advice and assistance to those local forces about the best way they can organize their efforts to take the fight to ISIL or to take the hill inside of Syria,"" he said.But the definition of combat has shifted since the United States last year began taking on the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL. In May, Delta Force commandos entered Syria aboard Black Hawk helicopters and V-22 Ospreys and killed an Islamic State leader and about a dozen militant fighters. The soldier killed last week was part of a force accompanying Kurdish commandos on a raid to free prisoners held by the Islamic State.In addition to the Special Operations deployment, Mr. Obama authorized deploying A-10 and F-15 warplanes to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. The A-10s are capable of providing close in-air support to fighters on the ground. The F-15s can carry out a range of air-to-ground combat missions.Mr. Obama, who spoke with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq on Friday, instructed advisers to consult the Baghdad government about establishing a Special Operations task force to further efforts to target Islamic State leaders there. He also ordered more military assistance to Jordan and Lebanon.The Pentagon wants to build a firewall behind forces allied with the United States -- both the Kurds and the Syrian-Arab coalition backed by Mr. Obama -- to allow these fighters to hold territory they have captured. Part of the way to do that, one Defense Department official said, is to ensure that equipment is delivered and that subsequent supplies will reach these forces quickly.The shift represents ""a kind of Goldilocks policy -- not too hot and not too cold,"" said Aaron David Miller, a vice president with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""Keep your eye on ISIS, keep your forces out of Russia's way and yet enhance your profile after Moscow has raised theirs.""At the moment, officials said there was no plan to send the American troops beyond a makeshift opposition group headquarters in northern Syria. They will not patrol or travel with opposition groups. Officials, though, also said that could change as the situation warrants. And they said no decision has been made on sending additional Apache helicopters to Iraq.The move could potentially put the American troops in the cross hairs of Russia, which last month began airstrikes on antigovernment forces in Syria. A senior Pentagon official said the United States had not informed Moscow about where the American forces will be. ""The area where we are planning to place these special operators is not an area where they have struck or where they would need to strike,"" the official said. ""It's not ISIL or regime-controlled.""But given that most Russian airstrikes have been against opposition groups that are not part of the Islamic State, there is no guarantee that Moscow may not hit groups in which the American forces are embedded. That said, Russia has ""significant visibility"" over what happens in Syria, the official said, adding that if it becomes necessary to keep its troops safe the United States will communicate with Moscow.But Mr. Miller and other foreign policy specialists warned that the move risked alienating Turkey since it will bring American forces into an even closer alliance with northern Syria's Kurdish fighters, including Kurdish People's Protection Units, which have come under attack from Turkey in recent days.Derek Chollet, a former assistant defense secretary under Mr. Obama, said the administration would seek to calm Turkish concern by saying the move would help protect its interests. ""After all, the Turks have wanted U.S. Special Forces on the ground in Syria for years,"" he said.The diplomatic progress reported in Vienna came after seven hours of heated negotiations, punctuated by sharp exchanges between the foreign ministers of Iran and Saudi Arabia. But it amounted to more of an aspiration than a settlement.Mr. Kerry and the other diplomats set no deadline for either the cease-fire or a new constitution and election that would follow, and it remained unclear whether Mr. Assad, who was not invited, or the rebels seeking to overthrow him will agree. But the diplomats will meet again in two weeks to expand on the basic principles issued on Friday night, including a commitment to keep Syria together as a single nation.Mr. Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister, announced the results together, but they remained deeply divided on whether Mr. Assad must step down as part of any final resolution, as the United States and its European and Persian Gulf allies have demanded and Russia and Iran have resisted.""We have no agreement on the destiny of Assad,"" Mr. Lavrov told reporters as he sat next to Mr. Kerry. ""Russia believes that it is up to Syrian people to decide within the framework of the political process.""Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said Mr. Assad's eventual departure remained a necessity. ""As far as we are concerned, we think that Bashar al-Assad has no place in the future of Syria,"" he said.Both Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov said the cease-fire would not apply to the conflict with Islamic State forces. Mr. Lavrov declined to criticize, at least publicly, the American decision to send Special Operations forces to northern Syria. Mr. Kerry told reporters the timing of the announcement was ""a coincidence"" and that he was not aware a decision had been made until earlier Friday.The two men said they discussed coordination of their attacks beyond the narrow conversations about avoiding an accidental conflict. ""We have some ideas which we discussed today that I am taking back to Washington,"" Mr. Kerry said.Still, the tensions in Vienna emphasized how difficult it could be to reach a common understanding. The most heated conversations took place between Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and his Saudi counterpart, Adel al-Jubeir. Until a few days ago, the Saudis refused to sit in the same room with the Iranians and they spent much of the meeting ""voicing grievances and accusations,"" said one official.",1.0
China Building Runway on Contested Island:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIJING -- China is building a concrete runway on an island in the South China Sea's contested waters that will be capable of handling military aircraft when finished, satellite images released Thursday show.The first section of the runway appears like a piece of gray ribbon on an image taken last month of Fiery Cross Reef, part of the Spratly Islands, an archipelago claimed by at least three other countries. Adjacent to the runway, work is underway on an apron for taxiing and parking planes.The runway, which is expected to be about 10,000 feet long -- enough to accommodate fighter jets and surveillance aircraft -- is a game changer in the competition between the United States and China in the South China Sea, said Peter Dutton, professor of strategic studies at the Naval War College in Rhode Island.""This is a major strategic event,"" Mr. Dutton said. ""In order to have sea control, you need to have air control.""Analysts had speculated that China planned to build an airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef, but the satellite image from March 23, provided by Airbus and released Thursday by Jane's Defense Weekly, is the first hard evidence that it is doing so.In time, Mr. Dutton said, China is likely to install radar and missiles that could intimidate countries like the Philippines, an American ally, and Vietnam, which also have claims to the Spratlys, as they resupply modest military garrisons in the area.More broadly, he said, China's ability to use Fiery Cross Reef as a landing strip for fighter and surveillance aircraft will vastly expand its zone of competition with the United States in the South China Sea.Over the past decade and a half, a series of tense encounters between American and Chinese forces on the sea and in the air, starting with a near collision in 2001 between an American EP-3 spy plane and a Chinese fighter, have occurred in the sea's northern waters, near China. The new installations in the Spratlys, about 1,000 miles beyond China's southernmost point on Hainan Island, will create a much wider arena for potential close calls, Mr. Dutton said.""This will expand the area in which there are likely to be tensions between the United States and China,"" he said.The construction on Fiery Cross Reef is part of a larger Chinese reclamation project involving scores of dredgers on at least five islands in the South China Sea. China is converting tiny reefs, once barely visible above water, into islands big enough to handle military hardware, personnel and recreation facilities for workers.Satellite images of the reclamation efforts have been released in steady doses over the last few months, as smaller countries with claims to islands in the area have voiced concern about China's accelerated construction, and as the United States has stepped up its criticism.During his recent first trip to Asia as the American defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter said in Japan that the reclamation efforts were seriously aggravating tensions between Beijing and Washington and hurting prospects for diplomatic solutions.After Mr. Carter spoke, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington research group, released images of Mischief Reef, also in the Spratly archipelago, that showed large-scale dredging of sand and coral to create land mass on what had been a partly submerged reef.The construction on Fiery Cross Reef, hundreds of miles west of Mischief Reef, appears to have taken place in the last several weeks. An Airbus image from Feb. 6, also released Thursday by Jane's Defense Weekly, shows empty sand where the runway is now being built.""We absolutely think it is for military aircraft, but of course an airstrip is an airstrip -- anything can land on it if it's long enough,"" said James Hardy, Asia-Pacific editor for Jane's Defense Weekly. ""Three thousand meters is big enough for pretty much any aircraft."" He noted that the superjumbo Airbus A380's runway requirement is 2,950 meters, or just under 10,000 feet.Other runways used by the Chinese military have ranged from around 8,850 feet to more than 13,100, Mr. Hardy said. By comparison, he said, the runway the United States Air Force maintains at Diego Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean that is much bigger and more developed than Fiery Cross Reef, is 11,800 feet.""The main question is, what else would land there?"" he said. ""Unless they are planning to turn these into resorts -- which seems unlikely, not least given the statement from the Foreign Ministry last week -- then military aircraft are the only things that would need to land there.""China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement last week that the reclamation efforts were intended to serve civilian purposes, such as providing a base for search-and-rescue operations, but also for ""satisfying the need of necessary military defense."" Though the statement placed more emphasis on the nonmilitary goals, it was a rare acknowledgment of Chinese military intentions in the South China Sea.Mr. Hardy said China's military appeared to have chosen Fiery Cross Reef as a command-and-control center for its Spratly Islands operations.China claims more than 80 percent of the South China Sea, arguing that a ""nine-dash line"" that it drew around the waterway in the late 1940s conforms to its rights there. No other country recognizes the validity of the nine-dash line, and many fear that China's reclamation activities are part of a drive to create an inevitability about Chinese ownership.In another example of the Pentagon's growing criticism of China's efforts, a senior Navy commander, Rear Adm. Christopher J. Paul, said last month in Australia that there were countries ""who attempt to constrict movement through international waters, who create land areas where there were none; who create exclusion zones where there should be shared use.""In response, he said, the Navy is creating ""hunter-killer surface action groups"" of ships. He suggested that Australia, one of America's top allies, would be invited to contribute to the new efforts in offensive naval warfare.Photograph Satellite Images Released by Jane's Defense Weekly Show That, Between Feb. 6 and March 23, China Built the First Section of a Concrete Runway On Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands Archipelago, Which at Least Three Other Countries Claim.

U.S. Drone Kills a Top Figure in Al Qaeda's Yemen Branch:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- An American drone strike has killed a top ideologue and spokesman for Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen, the terrorist group announced Tuesday. The spokesman, Ibrahim al-Rubeish, a 35-year-old Saudi citizen, had been held for five years in the United States military prison at Guantánamo Bay.A statement from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, posted on Twitter, said that Mr. Rubeish was killed Monday in what it called a ""hate-filled Crusader strike"" near Al Mukalla, a city on Yemen's southern coast.Since 2009, Mr. Rubeish has been the group's voice in many important pronouncements, including a video eulogy for Anwar al-Awlaki, the American cleric killed in a drone strike in 2011.Mr. Rubeish, the latest of a half-dozen senior Qaeda operatives killed by American strikes in Yemen over the past year, was drawn into the terrorist network as a young man and rose nearly to the top of Al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate. The statement said Mr. Rubeish ""spent nearly two decades as a mujahid,"" an Islamic fighter, ""in the cause of Allah, battling against America and its agents,"" according to a translation by the Site Intelligence Group.American counterterrorism officials say that killing operatives of the Yemen affiliate has kept it off balance, making it harder to plot against the United States. But in the judgment of most experts, the Qaeda branch there is at least as strong as it was before American drone strikes began in Yemen in 2009, in part as a result of political chaos in the country.But Gerald M. Feierstein, a senior diplomat who was ambassador to Yemen from 2010 to 2013, called the death of Mr. Rubeish a ""major setback"" for the Qaeda franchise. He said that he had no details on the attack, but that it appeared to show that the United States could carry out strikes without a stable government in Yemen to offer support.""At this particular moment, they might feel they're operating with a certain level of impunity,"" Mr. Feierstein said of the Qaeda branch, speaking in an interview after a congressional hearing on Yemen. ""If we can deny them that assurance, that's a good thing.""The strike was the first in Yemen in about six weeks, according to independent groups that track counterterrorism strikes. American drones have continued to carry out surveillance flights over Yemen, but strikes slowed last month after the American Embassy was closed and 125 American Special Operations troops were pulled out of an air base in the south.In recent months, Iran-backed Shiite militia forces known as the Houthis have seized the Yemeni capital, Sana, and faced off against Yemen's government and airstrikes carried out by a Saudi-led coalition of Sunni countries. Earlier this month, Qaeda fighters took advantage of disarray among security forces and seized Al Mukalla, looting a bank and freeing hundreds of prisoners.A senior Obama administration official declined to comment on the strike that killed Mr. Rubeish. But the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, made clear that the recent withdrawal did not end American drone operations, which are carried out from bases in Saudi Arabia and Djibouti, in eastern Africa.""We continue to actively monitor terrorist threats emanating from Yemen, and we have capabilities postured in the area to address them,"" the official said.For several years, American counterterrorism officials have seen Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula as the terrorist group posing the greatest threat to the United States. It was responsible for two failed plots to blow up United States-bound airliners: one in 2009 that used explosives hidden in a bomber's underwear, and a foiled attack in 2010 using bombs hidden in printer cartridges addressed to Chicago and sent aboard cargo planes.The life and death of Mr. Rubeish reflected several stages in the struggle of the United States to deal with terrorist suspects since 2001, including his imprisonment at Guantánamo and his participation in a Saudi rehabilitation program for militants, which evidently failed.According to a biography prepared by officials at Guantánamo, Mr. Rubeish was born into a wealthy Saudi family and earned a certificate in Islamic law. He wanted to join the fight against Russian forces in Chechnya, but after traveling to Pakistan for training he was directed to a Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan in May 2001, when he was about 22.After the Sept. 11 attacks, he fought at Tora Bora in Afghanistan and was captured by Pakistani forces and turned over to the United States, arriving at Guantánamo in January 2002. A 2005 assessment judged that he was a member of Al Qaeda who posed a ""medium"" risk and said that he had ""some type of leadership role among detainees and strongly influences them."" He contributed an ""Ode to the Sea"" to a collection of poems by Guantánamo prisoners published in 2007.Earlier in 2005, Mr. Rubeish was among several Guantánamo detainees to challenge their detention with a habeas corpus petition in federal court in Washington. The petition was denied, but in December 2006, the George W. Bush administration sent Mr. Rubeish home to Saudi Arabia on the condition that he enter the rehabilitation program.That program generally has a good reputation among counterterrorism experts, but among its most prominent failures were militants who helped form Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in 2009. The former deputy leader of that Qaeda branch, Saeed al-Shihri, followed the same path from Guantánamo to the Saudi rehab program and then to Yemen, where he died in a drone strike in 2013.Mr. Rubeish, whose family name is sometimes spelled Arbaysh in English, soon emerged as a regular spokesman for the Qaeda branch. In 2009, when the group sent a suicide bomber to Saudi Arabia in an unsuccessful attempt to kill that country's counterterrorism chief, Mr. Rubeish offered the justification in an audio message.After Mr. Awlaki was killed in a drone strike in September 2011, Mr. Rubeish who took the central role in the group's elaborate video remembrance. Last year, he denounced the American airstrikes against the so-called Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, saying the decision not to send ground troops ""is due to the bitterness of what they tasted in their past experience in Iraq and Afghanistan.""In January, after gunmen attacked the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, Mr. Rubeish praised the killings and called for more attacks in France and elsewhere in the West. The State Department had labeled him a ""specially designated global terrorist,"" and the government was offering a reward of up to $5 million for information about his location.",1.0
"U.S. Soldiers, Back in Iraq, Find Security Forces in Disrepair:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"CAMP TAJI, Iraq -- Lt. Col. John Schwemmer is here for his sixth Iraq deployment. Maj. James Modlin is on his fourth. Sgt. Maj. Thomas Foos? ""It's so many, I would rather not say. Sir.""These soldiers are among 300 from the 5-73 Squadron of the 82nd Airborne Division of the United States Army, about half of them trainers, the rest support and force protection. Stationed at this old Iraqi military base 20 miles north of Baghdad, they are as close as it gets to American boots on the ground in Iraq.Back now for the first time since the United States left in 2011, none of them thought they would be here again, let alone return to find the Iraqi Army they had once trained in such disrepair.Colonel Schwemmer said he was stunned at the state in which he found the Iraqi soldiers when he arrived here. ""It's pretty incredible,"" he said. ""I was kind of surprised. What training did they have after we left?""Apparently, not much. The current, woeful state of the Iraqi military raises the question not so much of whether the Americans left too soon, but whether a new round of deployments for training will have any more effect than the last.Iraq's army looked good on paper when the Americans left, after one of the biggest training missions carried out under wartime conditions. But after that, senior Iraqi officers began buying their own commissions, paying for them out of the supply, food and payroll money of their troops. Corruption ran up and down the ranks; desertion was rife.The army did little more than staff checkpoints. Then, last year, four divisions collapsed overnight in Mosul and elsewhere in northern Iraq under the determined assault of Islamic State fighters numbering in the hundreds or at most the low thousands, and the extremists' advance came as far as this base.An army that once counted 280,000 active-duty personnel, one of the largest in the world, is now believed by some experts to have as few as four to seven fully active divisions -- as little as 50,000 troops by some estimates. The director of media operations for Iraq's Ministry of Defense, Qais al-Rubaiae, said, however, that even by the most conservative estimates, the army now had at least 141,000 soldiers in 15 divisions.Most of the American soldiers were intimately involved in training Iraqi forces before, too. ""When I left in 2009,"" Major Modlin said, ""they had it, they really did. I don't know what happened after that.""""We used to say that every deployment was different,"" Major Modlin said. ""But we quickly found out that this time was completely different from any other time. The Iraqis know that this time we're not going to do it for them, and they appreciate that.""The 300 American soldiers here, with a smaller number of United States Marines at Al Asad air base in Anbar Province, are the only American soldiers deployed outside Baghdad. But as the military sees it, they do not count as ""boots on the ground"" since their role is purely to train, advise and assist, as part of a 3,000-person deployment authorized in November by President Obama.In fact, Master Sgt. Mike Lavigne, a military spokesman (one tour in Iraq and three in Afghanistan), does not like that term at all. ""We do not have a single boot on the ground,"" he said. ""Really, not one.""Even in a training role, however, this venerable Iraqi military base puts American soldiers very close to what passes for a front line in the conflict with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. From time to time, the extremists lob mortar rounds from their hiding places east of the base, just across the Tigris River.There is little chance they will hit anything. The base is huge, and their aim is as bad as it was in Al Qaeda's day, when the Americans were last here -- and used it as a major training base. Nonetheless, no one goes around without body armor on.On Thursday, the American instructors were leading a live-fire exercise, teaching basic small-unit maneuvering while firing at pop-up targets. Squad-size groups of Iraqi soldiers charged through a scrub-brush field, so realistic fires popped up around them.""Small-unit maneuvering is pretty standard the world over,"" Command Sgt. Maj. Michael Ames said. As basic as the training was, many of the trainees -- even those in the army already more than a year -- had never experienced it.It was a striking departure from the last years of the Iraq war, when American and Iraqi soldiers were carefully separated at training facilities. Live ammunition was rarely used when they were together in the latter years of the American presence, for fear of so-called insider attacks, in which soldiers assault their Western allies.""You have to have a level of trust, and we're with them here,"" Colonel Schwemmer said. ""It's the common enemy that ties us together.""Sgt. Ali Mesin Hamid, the squad leader, was clearly appreciative. ""We've never had training this good,"" he said after his men went through the exercise, exulting at having hit all the targets. ""We'll be ready for the real fight.""Their American drill instructor, Sgt. First Class James Grimes (four deployments to Iraq), had a more nuanced view, as he showed the soldiers a sandbox representing the field they had just been on. Bottle caps stood for each fighter and piles of sand for their firing positions.""You guys saw how quick you ran out of ammo, right?"" he said. And they needed to concentrate more on making sure their fields of fire overlapped, covering a broader area than just the targets they could see. ""Other than that, pretty good.""Those soldiers were already in their fifth week of a six-week basic training course; some will come back for an additional three weeks. In all, 3,600 from two Iraqi brigades are in the American training program, and 4,600 more have graduated since the program began late last year.With the Taji training site running at maximum capacity, as it is now, that means the program will reach at most about 30,000 Iraqi soldiers by the end of this year, probably far fewer. The Marines at Al Asad train smaller numbers of regular soldiers.""They're going to leave here trained,"" Colonel Schwemmer said. ""But there's a big difference between trained and seasoned.""Whether those who are trained go straight into the fight against the Islamic State is not a decision the Americans will be part of. That, they say, is entirely an Iraqi government decision. Given the shortages of troops in the fight against the Islamic State, deployment on the front lines seems pretty likely.Many of the trainees were relatively new recruits, who had joined straight after the collapse of the military in the face of the Islamic State's onslaught in June. Some had originally joined the popular Shiite militias, which are credited with halting the extremists' advance after the military fell apart.But they are also blamed for human rights abuses and the deepening rift between Sunnis and Shiites, which the Sunni-based insurgency has exploited.Ahmed Abud Hassan, 21, joined after his cousin at Camp Speicher was presumably killed among the 1,700 prisoners executed there by the Islamic State. Sajad Hakim, 21, had a brother in Mosul in the military who was never seen again.The two men, Shiites from Diwaniya, said they eventually chose the military over the militias; for one thing, it offered better pay and a pension.""We're not going to stop,"" Mr. Hassan said. ""We're going to keep fighting in their honor.""Their Iraqi regimental commander, Maj. Masar Hasim (six deployments with American soldiers, and three other wars), was a veteran of a half-dozen battlefields against the Islamic State in the past year, but he said this was the first time his men had received any meaningful training.""This is a completely different level of training, nothing like what we had before,"" he said. But the Iraqi major was cleareyed about their ability and thought it would be a long time before they made a difference in the field.""If I get 100 good soldiers out of this 400 we have here, I would feel like a king,"" he said.Photograph Iraqi Army Recruits Training in Taji, Iraq, On Sunday.

Drone Strikes Said to Set a Dangerous Precedent:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- An investigation of American drone strikes in Yemen concludes that the Obama administration has not followed its own rules to avoid civilian casualties and is setting a dangerous example for other countries that want to use unmanned aircraft against terrorists.The study, by the Open Society Justice Initiative, a legal advocacy group based in New York, was released on Monday at a time when Yemen has been engulfed in violence and American drone strikes have been slowed or halted. But its observations about the performance of American counterterrorism strikes from 2012 to 2014 remain relevant for assessing a novel weapons system that the United States has used in several countries and has now approved for export to a limited number of allies.Despite promises of greater openness about drone strikes, the Obama administration has continued to guard their secrecy closely and says nothing publicly about strike targets and results. The resulting information vacuum has been partly filled by independent studies by groups like the Open Society Justice Initiative, which worked with the Mwatana Organization for Human Rights, a Yemeni group that interviewed witnesses.In May 2013, in a long-planned speech on the targeted killing of terrorists, President Obama described a rigorous standard that he said guided all drone strikes. ""Before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured -- the highest standard we can set,"" he said.Mr. Obama said that some civilian casualties were unavoidable, adding, ""For me, and those in my chain of command, those deaths will haunt us as long as we live.""But the new report questions how careful the strikes have been, based on the analysis of nine strikes in Yemen, where strikes are carried out by both the C.I.A. and the military's Joint Special Operations Command. Each of those strikes killed civilians, the study found, with a total of 26 civilians killed, including five children, and 13 others injured.""We've found evidence that President Obama's standard is not being met on the ground,"" said Amrit Singh, a senior legal officer at the Open Society Justice Initiative and a primary author of the report. ""There's a real question about whether the near-certainty standard is being applied in practice.""Asked about the report's findings, a National Security Council spokesman, Ned Price, said that he was ""not in a position to comment on specific cases"" because of secrecy rules, but that the standard Mr. Obama described in 2013 was still in place.""In those rare instances in which it appears noncombatants may have been killed or injured, after-action reviews have been conducted to determine why,"" he said, adding that condolence payments were sometimes given to those injured and families of those killed.Mr. Price said administration officials ""continue to work diligently toward"" the goal of greater transparency. The military announced strikes against Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria, as well as recent strikes in Somalia, but no information has been released on strikes in Pakistan or Yemen.The Open Society report also questions whether the administration is acting on its stated policy of always capturing terrorists when ""feasible"" rather than killing them. In two of the strikes it studied, the researchers quoted witnesses as saying the targeted individuals, who had been identified by American intelligence as members of Al Qaeda, could easily have been arrested by the Yemeni authorities.An American official, speaking about the classified operations on the condition of anonymity, said that in some cases a foreign government ""only has the most tenuous reach into parts of its territory"" and that capture operations ""would pose profound risks to our forces."" But the official noted that foreign partners often capture and imprison terrorism suspects based on American intelligence.Drones loaded with Hellfire missiles and other munitions were first used by the United States in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and became an integral part of the American wars there and in Iraq. There were sporadic strikes against militants in Pakistan until mid-2008, when President George W. Bush sharply escalated the drone campaign there.Mr. Obama stepped up strikes in Pakistan further and expanded them to Yemen and Somalia early in his presidency. The pace of strikes has slowed, however, and is well below the peak in 2010 in Pakistan and 2012 in Yemen.Advocates of drone strikes argue that they are particularly suited for pursuing small groups of terrorists and that they kill far fewer civilians than conventional airstrikes or ground troops. American officials often assert that accounts of civilian deaths by independent groups are exaggerated, but they rarely give their own account of who was killed.""This program has no public disclosure about who's being killed and why, and there's no public accountability,"" Ms. Singh, the report's author, said. ""If you insulate a program with secrecy, you prevent information that could correct it from coming to light.""In the most recent strike analyzed by the Open Society report, in April 2014, two drones fired on a Toyota Land Cruiser outside the town of Bayda. The report concludes that the men in the Land Cruiser, all of whom were killed, were indeed Qaeda fighters.But shrapnel from the strike hit 12 laborers in a Toyota Hilux just ahead of the Land Cruiser. Four of them were killed and five more injured, the report found, based on interviews with survivors. Based on negotiations between tribal leaders and the Yemeni government, the government paid about $55,000 in compensation and 30 Kalashnikov rifles, costs that Yemeni officials have said are generally covered by the United States.Another strike in the same province in September 2012, the report found, killed 12 people and injured two others as they rode a truck home after selling their wares in a town market. The victims included a pregnant woman and her 10-year-old daughter, as well as 15- and 17-year-old boys. The researchers found no evidence of Qaeda connections among those killed. Local news reports said the intended target was a local Qaeda leader who was not present.Again, the government compensated the affected families with cash and weapons. But the fear of strikes from the drones that regularly patrolled the skies lingered. ""We live in constant fear,"" the report quoted an anonymous survivor as saying. ""There is no assurance that we would not be the next targets."" The brother of one of those killed was quoted as declaring, ""The U.S. government should come to the region to see what targets it has hit.""Ms. Singh said, ""The voices of these individuals have not been heard by the U.S. government, because no one is going over to Yemen and asking what happened.""The C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan, said at his confirmation hearing in 2013 that he believed that the United States should publicly acknowledge unintended civilian deaths in counterterrorism strikes. But it has never happened.For years, arms experts have been concerned about the example set by the United States for other countries as armed drones proliferate. Drones have been used to fire missiles by Israel and Britain as well as by the United States, but many other countries are seeking to develop or buy them.In February, in response to pressure from arms manufacturers and many countries, the Obama administration announced rules governing the export of armed drones. A State Department fact sheet said the rules required ""all sales and transfers to include agreement to principles for proper use.""Photograph A Building in the Yemeni Province of Shabwah That Was Destroyed by an American Drone Strike Targeting Qaeda Forces.

Philippines Issues a Protest Over China's Island-Building:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MANILA -- China's island-building activities have destroyed about 300 acres of coral reefs and are causing ""irreversible and widespread damage to the biodiversity and ecological balance"" of the South China Sea, a spokesman for the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said on Monday.""China has pursued these activities unilaterally, disregarding people in the surrounding states who have depended on the sea for their livelihood for generations,"" the spokesman, Charles Jose, said during a news briefing in Manila.He said China's neighbors in the South China Sea could lose up to $100 million a year because of the loss of the coral reefs, which are breeding grounds for high-value fish harvested by countries surrounding the sea.China has been undertaking land reclamation projects on the sand spits, islets and submerged reefs of the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, according to satellite images released in the last year. United States and Philippine officials have said the newly constructed islands could serve as military outposts in the area, parts of which are also claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam and other governments.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said last week that the construction was focused on building maritime aids for China, its neighbors and international vessels in the South China Sea. The islands will host ""typhoon shelters, navigation aids, search-and-rescue centers, marine meteorological forecasting stations, fishing services and civil administration offices,"" she said.United States military officials have used strong language in the past month to protest China's island-building activities, noting that the construction work is decreasing the chances of a diplomatic resolution to the territorial disputes in the South China Sea.Last week, the Philippines and the United States announced that their annual joint military exercises would be the largest conducted in 15 years and would include war games in coastal areas facing the South China Sea. The exercises, which are to begin next Monday, include more than 11,000 soldiers and sailors from both countries. That is twice the number of troops involved in last year's exercises, officials said.The joint operations will be conducted throughout the country, including on the west coast of Luzon Island and in the western coastal areas of the province of Palawan, both of which face the South China Sea. Some of the military drills will be held at the former United States naval base in San Miguel in the province of Zambales, which is less than 150 miles from Scarborough Shoal, a Chinese-controlled reef that is also claimed by the Philippines.Philippine military officials said last week that the expansion of the war games was not intended to send a message to China. A Philippine military spokesman, Lt. Col. Harold Cabunoc, said the activities, called Balikatan, were part of regular annual exercises and would be focused primarily on disaster response.""The higher strength of Balikatan 2015 for this year only reflects the Philippines' and the United States' growing commitment to enhance our capability to conduct joint military and nonmilitary activities,"" he said.The Philippines filed a case in March last year with an international tribunal based in the Netherlands seeking to clarify the conflicting claims in the South China Sea. The Philippine foreign secretary, Albert del Rosario, has said a decision from the tribunal could come by the first quarter of 2016. China has declined to participate in the proceedings, saying the areas in question are sovereign territory not under the jurisdiction of an international tribunal.",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; China: U.S. Blamed for Regional Rifts:   [Foreign Desk ],,"HONG KONG -- A top Chinese official said Thursday that American military drills and surveillance flights in the South China Sea were threatening regional stability, a harsh assessment that seemed likely to heighten tensions between the two countries before several crucial meetings.The official, Col. Yang Yujun, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, said it was the United States, not China, that was to blame for rising tensions in the resource-rich South China Sea, where China and several other countries are engaged in territorial disputes.""The Chinese side expresses its deep concern about the United States pushing the militarization,"" Colonel Yang said at a news conference in Beijing. ""The behavior by the United States can only lead one to suspect whether the American side is driven by a desire to see the world in turmoil.""The dispute over the South China Sea, one of the world's busiest trade routes, has emerged as a serious point of contention between China and the United States.It is likely to be high on the agenda when President Xi Jinping visits the United States to meet with President Obama in September, and when Secretary of State John Kerry goes to Malaysia next week for a meeting of Asian nations.China has argued that it is entitled to 90 percent of the sea, putting it at odds with several nearby countries, including the Philippines and Vietnam. In recent months, it has accelerated its efforts to build artificial islands hundreds of miles off its shore, capable of holding runways, radar and missile systems. China maintains that the islands will primarily be used for rescue operations and scientific research.While the United States has not taken a formal position on the territorial disputes, it has called on China to resolve the disagreements in international courts, an idea that Beijing has resisted. American officials have also worked to deepen military ties in the region, for example, by participating in joint military exercises with the Philippines, as well as air and sea surveillance operations.In his remarks on Thursday, Colonel Yang took aim at those efforts, pointing to a recent seven-hour surveillance flight over the South China Sea by the commander of the United States Pacific Fleet, Adm. Scott H. Swift. Colonel Yang warned that the United States should maintain a ""safe distance to avoid unexpected incidents.""In an aside, he added, ""If there are American people willing to board civilian vessels to enjoy the beautiful scenery of China's South China Sea, we can express our welcome.""Colonel Yang also criticized recent comments by Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., commander of the United States Pacific Command. At a panel discussion in Colorado this month, Admiral Harris accused China of pursuing military objectives in the South China Sea and causing damage to the ocean environment.The Defense Department took issue with Mr. Yang, arguing that the United States had contributed to economic prosperity in the region.""We have helped to sustain a rules-based maritime regime that safeguards for all nations the freedoms of navigation and overflight and other related lawful uses of the sea,"" Cmdr. William Urban, a spokesman for the Defense Department, said in a statement.Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the Chinese seemed eager to gain the upper hand in the debate by criticizing the United States in the same manner that Americans had criticized China recently.""The region is on edge,"" Ms. Glaser said. ""China is under a microscope, and I don't think the Chinese really have an effective strategy for reassuring the region.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
Turkey Aims Its Airstrikes at the Kurds:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Turkey stepped up its offensive against Kurdish militias in northern Iraq early Wednesday, pounding targets in six locations from the air, officials said.The Iraqi government condemned the airstrikes, calling them ""a dangerous escalation and an assault on Iraqi sovereignty.""Turkish officials said the airstrikes were carried out in response to a string of terrorist attacks in Turkey by militants of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K., a separatist group that waged a 30-year insurgency against Turkish rule. The office of Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in a written statement that the strikes on Wednesday were against shelters, depots and caves used as hide-outs by the group. No information was released concerning casualties.The P.K.K. reached a cease-fire agreement with the Turkish government two years ago, but that tenuous peace has fallen apart in recent weeks. The government says that the group has refused to disarm and that it has carried out a series of attacks since the parliamentary elections on June 7, when Kurdish candidates made a strong showing.On Tuesday, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey, said it was impossible to continue a peace process with the militants while they threatened national unity and brotherhood. He called on Parliament to deny immunity from prosecution to any lawmakers linked to terrorist groups, a remark seen as a threat to Kurdish lawmakers.Turkey agreed last week to take a more active role in the American-led coalition's fight against the Islamic State, the Sunni Arab militant group that has seized large areas of Syria and Iraq. But Turkey's air campaign since then has mainly been directed at the P.K.K., and the bombing raids it began on Friday effectively ended the cease-fire.The possibility of retaliatory attacks by the P.K.K. prompted a warning from the German Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, saying that the underground rail network and bus stops in Istanbul could be targets, Reuters reported.Mr. Davutoglu said Turkey would keep bombing the Kurdish militants as long as the militants threatened violence. ""If we have one martyr, we will continue all operations on that organization that ordered the attack,"" Mr. Davutoglu told members of his governing party in a speech on Wednesday.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"World Briefing | Europe; Sweden: Russian Sub Spotted, 99 Years After It Sank:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"LONDON -- The mystery vessel was found off the Swedish coast last week lying on the sea floor, its hatches closed. Cyrillic letters on the hull suggested it was Russian.In Sweden, where memories of the Cold War run deep, speculation swirled about whether the unidentified craft was a Russian submarine that had sunk while on a secret mission. Its age was not immediately obvious, and the Swedish authorities were unsure how long it had lain there, submerged and undetected.This week, the Swedish authorities said they had solved the mystery: The vessel was an imperial submarine -- nicknamed a Catfish -- that had probably sunk after colliding with a Swedish vessel in 1916, during World War I.The Swedish news media reported that the submarine had been part of the Imperial Russian Navy and that it had sunk with its crew of 18 in May 1916.""We have seen the wreck and we can confirm that the vessel is from the czarist era and that it is a submarine that collided with another ship,"" Lubna El-Shanti, a spokeswoman for the Swedish Armed Forces, said on Wednesday by telephone from Stockholm. ""It is a very old vessel. It is from before the time of the Soviet Union.""The discovery of the vessel comes at a time of tense East-West relations, with anxiety in the region fanned by Russia's annexation of Crimea and by the conflict in Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian rebels.In October, the sighting of a mysterious vessel off the Stockholm archipelago led Sweden to undertake its largest mobilization since the end of the Cold War. The discovery, including unsubstantiated reports of a man in black wading near the craft, prompted speculation that a Russian spy had been sent to infiltrate the country. A month later, Swedish officials confirmed that its territorial waters had been violated by a foreign submarine. The Kremlin insisted that the vessel did not belong to Russia.Referring to the latest discovery, Ms. Shanti stressed that while Sweden was always on the lookout for foreign vessels entering its waters without permission, the imperial submarine was a remnant of the past and had no relation to contemporary geopolitics.""This event has nothing to do with Russian aggression,"" she said.The submarine was discovered by a Swedish company called Ocean X Team, which hunts for lost treasure and shipwrecks. Ms. Shanti said the vessel had been identified by comparing photographs and footage of the wreck provided by Ocean X Team with archival photographs of Russian submarines.Submarines have a history of grabbing attention in Sweden. In 1981, when a Soviet submarine thought to have been carrying nuclear weapons hit an underwater rock off the Swedish coast near Karlskrona, Moscow and Stockholm engaged in a tense standoff for a week. During the episode, which was nicknamed ""Whisky on the Rocks,"" the Swedish authorities questioned the vessel's Soviet captain on a Swedish torpedo board, while the submarine was towed off the rock.The alarm over Russian submarines in Sweden has veered into popular culture and even farce. The Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, a leading antiwar organization, has installed what it calls the Singing Sailor Underwater Defense System, also known as the Gay Sailor, in the Baltic Sea off Stockholm.The unusual ""subsurface sonar system"" is a box with a neon sign of a gyrating sailor in white underwear and a cap. The group submerged the box, which sends out the message, ""This way if you are gay"" in Morse code through the water in what the group said was meant as an impudent deterrent to the Russian military. Another message, ""Welcome to Sweden. Gay since 1944,"" referring to the year Sweden legalized homosexuality, is written on the device.Andreas Ribbefjord, vice president of the peace group, said the system was both a commentary on homophobia in Russia and a revolt against calls for more spending on defense in Sweden.""We have had this fear of Russian submarines for months, and we wanted to counter this fearmongering,"" he said.

"China's Naval Buildup Starts to Yield Results, U.S. Report Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SINGAPORE -- China is rapidly building coast guard ships, the vessels that China most commonly uses for patrols in the South China Sea, and in the last three years has increased the number of ships in that category 25 percent, a new report by the United States Navy says.China has the world's largest coast guard fleet, with more such ships than its neighbors Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines combined, the report shows.The unclassified assessment of the Chinese Navy, the first in nine years by the United States Navy's Office of Naval Intelligence, says the rapid modernization over the last 15 years is yielding dramatic results.The Chinese Navy is ""on track to dramatically increase its combat capability by 2020 through rapid acquisition and improved operational proficiency,"" the report says.In 2014, China began construction on, launched or commissioned more than 60 vessels, and a similar number of ships were planned in 2015, it said, adding: ""In 2013 and 2014, China launched more naval ships than any other country and is expected to continue this trend through 2015-16.""The United States Navy faces growing competition from China in the Pacific Ocean, and Washington has become increasingly concerned about China's maritime power as it undertakes reclamation works to create artificial islands in contested areas of the South China Sea.The new islands were to serve a variety of purposes, among them the establishment of defensive military capabilities in the waterway, one of the busiest trade routes in the world, China's Foreign Ministry said Thursday.The Navy report noted that despite its slowing economy, China had continued its double-digit increases in military spending, announcing in March a military budget of $141.5 billion, an increase of 10 percent.In keeping with President Xi Jinping's goal to make China a great maritime power, China will have a much more robust navy with far greater reach in the coming decade with multiple aircraft carriers (China has only one so far), ballistic missile submarines and, potentially, a large-deck amphibious ship. At the moment, the report says, the Chinese Navy is built around destroyers, frigates and conventional submarines.The report confirms recent announcements in the Chinese state-run news media that China has deployed the YJ-18, a new generation supersonic antiship cruise missile that could present unprecedented challenges to the air defenses of American and allied ships, said Andrew S. Erickson, an associate professor at the United States Naval War College in Rhode Island.""Everyone serious about understanding Chinese military capabilities must familiarize themselves with this missile,"" Mr. Erickson said.An article in China Daily said last week that three ""cutting-edge nuclear-powered attack submarines"" had been manufactured by China and that one of them, referred to as the Type-093G, had a wing-shaped cross section designed to improve speed and mobility and to reduce noise. That submarine carried a vertical launcher capable of delivering China's latest YJ-18 supersonic antiship cruise missile, the article said.In the past, China had received antiship cruise missiles from Russia, but now China is making them at home and fielding them in greater numbers, said Lyle J. Goldstein, an associate professor in the China Maritime Studies Institute at the United States Naval War College.""This missile, and its air-launched cousin, the YJ-12, are major threats to the U.S. Navy,"" Mr. Goldstein said.

Tensions Between Iran and Saudi Arabia Deepen Over Conflict in Yemen:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia deepened on Thursday as Iranian leaders lashed out with rare vehemence against the continuing Saudi air campaign in Yemen, even hurling personal insults at the young Saudi prince who is leading the fight.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, on Thursday denounced the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen as ""a crime"" and ""a genocide,"" while all but taunting Saudi Arabia that its war in Yemen was doomed to fail.A regional coalition led by Saudi Arabia extended its bombing campaign for a 16th night in its effort to stop the Houthi movement and its allies from dominating Yemen. The Houthis nonetheless continued their advance, and aid groups warned of a compounding humanitarian catastrophe, particularly in the port city of Aden.Secretary of State John Kerry sharply warned Iran over its backing for the other side of the conflict in Yemen, in the first explicit American accusation that Tehran has been providing military aid to the Houthis.Washington was ""not going to stand by while the region is destabilized,"" Mr. Kerry said in an interview with ""PBS NewsHour"" on Wednesday night.""There are obviously supplies that have been coming from Iran,"" he added. ""There are a number of flights every single week that have been flying in. We trace those flights, and we know this. We are well aware of the support that Iran has been giving to Yemen.""The United States has recently increased the provision of logistical support, intelligence and weapons to the Saudi campaign, just days after the announcement of a framework for a nuclear deal with Iran. Mr. Kerry said he was seeking to reassure allies, including Saudi Arabia, that the United States could ""do two things at the same time."" The United States could help push back against Iranian attempts to project its influence around the region, he argued, while at the same time negotiating a deal that would reward Tehran for providing guarantees that it was not building nuclear weapons.Saudi Arabia has said it is bombing the Houthis because it sees them as an instrument of Iranian power, but Western diplomats and independent experts have said that while Iran has supported the Houthis financially, it has no direct control over the group.The back-and-forth insults and threats Thursday raised fears that the Yemeni conflict could further inflame the rivalry between the two regional heavyweights, Iran and Saudi Arabia, already fighting each other through sectarian proxies in Syria and in less overt struggles across Iraq, Lebanon and Bahrain.Some analysts suggested that the battle for Yemen may further complicate the delicate politics of a deal with the Western powers to restrain Iran's nuclear program. But others argued that the deal had instead emboldened Iran to flex its muscles against Saudi Arabia.""Deep down, the Iranians know that they are winning,"" said Michael Stephens, the head of the Royal United Services Institute in Doha, Qatar.Mr. Kerry appeared forced into a difficult balance, reassuring Saudi Arabia and other allies of American support against Iran without antagonizing Iranian hard-liners severely enough to fuel opposition to the nuclear deal.The Ayatollah's diatribe only added to the challenge.In rare direct criticism of Iran's rival by name, Ayatollah Khamenei said that Saudi Arabia was departing from a history of acting with dignity in foreign affairs, saying that ""inexperienced youths have taken over the affairs of the state and are replacing dignity with barbarity.""His comments were a jab at the Saudi defense minister, Prince Mohamed bin Salman, who Saudi diplomats say is about 30. He is also a son of King Salman, who ascended to the throne this year and promptly named him to the powerful dual roles of defense minister and chief of the royal court.The Saudi news media has been cheering Prince Mohamed as the architect and overseer of the Yemeni campaign despite a light résumé, raising eyebrows among rivals in the royal family and setting him up for embarrassment if it is deemed to have failed.In a statement on Thursday, Ayatollah Khamenei warned the Saudis ""they must cease their crimes in Yemen,"" and that failure there was all but inevitable.""They will be harmed and incur losses in this issue in which they will under no circumstances triumph. The Saudis' face will be rubbed in the ground in Yemen,"" he said, comparing the Saudi actions to Israel's campaigns against Palestinian militants in Gaza -- who have also received support from Iran.In another statement, released over Twitter along with some of his other remarks, the ayatollah further teased Saudi Arabia about its pledge to catch up to Iran in the development of a nuclear weapon.""An underdeveloped country said that 'If Iran has enrichment, we want it too,' "" he said. ""Well, do it if you can. Nuclear technology is our domestic capability.""Mr. Stephens, of the Royal Unity Services Institute, said the extraordinary barbed comments appeared designed to provoke and inflame.""It is almost like the Iranians are baiting the Saudis, trying to find every pressure point, to make the Saudis feel emasculated, and then stand back and watch as the Saudis get in deeper and deeper,"" he said.But at the same time, he argued, the Iranians were sending a message of support to their Yemeni allies, the Houthis.""They have decided to show that they are willing to stand behind the Houthis,"" Mr. Stephens said. ""The Iranians are making some sort of a guarantee to their allies that, whatever happens, they are going to make sure that the Houthis are at the table for the talks.""Saudi Arabia, which is leading a regional coalition against the Houthis, issued its own warning to Iran, saying that two Iranian warships that recently arrived in the waters off Yemen should steer clear of Yemeni waters. ""If the ships seek to aid the Houthis, the coalition has the right to choose the proper answer,"" said a spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ahmad Asseri.In another provocation, Saudi Arabia denied permission for an Iranian plane filled with pilgrims to land in Mecca.The Houthis, a group based in northern Yemen that follows a strain of Shiite Islam, have fought a half dozen conflicts with the Yemeni government since 2004, including a fight in 2009 that drew Saudi Arabia into border skirmishes. Only since that time, scholars say, has the movement received support from Iran, the region's main Shiite Muslim power as well as Saudi Arabia's rival.Since the fall, however, the Houthis have teamed with major units of the Yemeni security forces still loyal to the former strongman, Ali Abdullah Saleh. Those units have helped the Houthi-allied forces capture the capital, Sana, and much of Yemen.Their advance appears to have continued despite the two-week-old Saudi bombing campaign. On Thursday, Al Jazeera television network -- owned by Qatar, part of the Saudi coalition -- said the Houthi-allied forces had also occupied Ataq, capital of Shabwa Province, taking control of government offices.At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose efforts to restart a political dialogue in Yemen have collapsed, implored the Houthis to halt their expansion. But he also has been critical of the Saudi-led military campaign.""The coalition air raids -- and the continuing attempts by the Houthis and their allied armed groups to expand their power -- have turned an internal political crisis into a violent conflict that risks deep and long-lasting regional repercussions,"" Mr. Ban said at United Nations headquarters.""The last thing the region and our world need is more of the chaos and crimes we have seen in Libya and Syria,"" he said.",1.0
North Korea Fires Missiles Before U.S. Official's Trip:   [Foreign Desk ],,"OSAN AIR BASE, South Korea -- Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter's welcome present was waiting for him when he touched down here on Thursday: confirmed reports that North Korea fired two short-range missiles off its western coast two days before his first visit to South Korea as President Obama's defense chief.South Korean officials informed their American counterparts that the North on Tuesday fired two surface-to-air missiles from Pyongwon County in South Pyongan Province. The missiles flew only a few miles before plunging into the sea, defense officials said.Mr. Carter, who arrived here for talks with his South Korean counterparts over security measures on the Korean Peninsula, said the missile launch demonstrated how tense the region remained.""If it was a welcome message to me, I'm flattered,"" he told reporters in Japan before boarding his flight to South Korea.A senior defense official, speaking to reporters aboard Mr. Carter's plane, called the North Korean action ""provocative."" He said that ""you'll have to ask the North Koreans"" why they conducted the missile test so close to the arrival of the American defense secretary in South Korea, but he added that ""these are the kinds of provocative acts that the alliance is designed to respond to,"" referring to the military alliance between the United States and South Korea.The official said the Pentagon believed that the North Korean nuclear threat was growing.North Korea is officially banned from conducting ballistic missile tests by United Nations resolutions but routinely does so anyway, often to express anger. The North fired a series of short-range missiles into the sea last week to register its dislike of annual United States-South Korea military drills. The North also flouted United Nations resolutions the month before by launching two Scud-type ballistic missiles offshore, as the United States and South Korea began their annual joint military drills. At the time, the North Korean military issued a statement warning that it would ""never remain a passive onlooker"" to the annual joint war games, called Key Resolve and Foal Eagle.The exercises involve tens of thousands of South Korean and American troops.Tensions between the United States and North Korea have been even higher than usual since a cyberattack on Sony Pictures late last year. The United States has blamed North Korea for that attack.President Obama warned in January that a government like North Korea's would collapse over time, saying that the democratic influences of the Internet would eventually penetrate that country.Although both Washington and Seoul say their annual military exercises are defensive, Pyongyang often reacts harshly and stages its own maneuvers.In March 2010, a South Korean warship exploded in waters near the border with North Korea, killing 46 sailors, and Seoul attributed it to a North Korean torpedo attack.On Friday, Mr. Carter is scheduled to visit a memorial to those sailors.",1.0
Houthi Leader Is Defiant in Face of Saudi Airstrikes:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- More than three weeks after Saudi Arabia began a bombing campaign aimed at crippling his movement, the leader of Yemen's Houthi rebels responded with defiance on Sunday in a televised speech, saying that Saudi attempts to ""humiliate"" his country were doomed.""Those who want the people to give in are just dreaming,"" the leader, Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, said in a long, fuming address that was also sharply critical of the United States. ""Our Yemeni people have the right to fend off the aggression, and to confront the aggressor with all possible and available means,"" he said on a Houthi news channel.Mr. Houthi gave no indication that he was willing to negotiate with the Saudis or to agree to their conditions for a cease-fire, including that the Houthis withdraw from cities they have captured. His defiance suggested a prolonged war and raised further questions about the Saudi government's military strategy, which has been centered on pounding the Houthis and their allies from the air.The Saudis launched the intervention with backing from the United States and a coalition of Arab states, aiming to restore Yemen's exiled government, led by President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The coalition's warplanes have carried out hundreds of airstrikes, targeting military bases and positions held by the Houthis and their main allies, military units and security forces loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh, who ceded the presidency in 2012.The intensity of the Saudi bombing has left Yemen facing the likelihood of a devastated military, even when this conflict ends. The airstrikes have also hit factories and homes, killing dozens of civilians and arousing misgivings even among Saudi allies.Residents in Sana, the capital, have been subjected to daily airstrikes for weeks. And in the southern port city of Aden, hundreds of people have been killed in street fighting between the Houthis and Mr. Saleh's forces on one side, and local militias representing Yemen's southern separatists on the other.In the latest sign the war is spreading, dozens of people have been killed in recent days in Taiz, Yemen's third largest city, where fighters loyal to Mr. Hadi, backed by Saudi airstrikes, are battling the Houthis and their allies.Several military units have switched sides by declaring their loyalty to the exiled president, Mr. Hadi. On Sunday, Yemeni officials told the Reuters news agency that a brigadier general who commands a district along the Saudi border and leads 15,000 troops had also pledged his support for Mr. Hadi.It remained to be seen whether the defections would tip the balance in the conflict or simply further fracture the country. A multiplying cast of combatants are being drawn into the fight -- including military units with shifting loyalties, armed tribesmen, separatist fighters and extremist militants with Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch -- and are confusing the battle lines.",1.0
World Briefing | Europe; Ukraine: Kremlin Issues Warning as U.S. Military Trainers Arrive:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- The Kremlin on Friday warned that the arrival of several hundred American military trainers in Ukraine could ""destabilize the situation"" in the country's southeast, where a cease-fire between government troops and Russian-backed separatists is barely holding.On Friday, the United States Army announced that about 300 troops from the 173rd Airborne Brigade, based in Italy, had arrived in western Ukraine this week for Operation Fearless Guardian, a six-month training rotation for three battalions of Ukraine's National Guard engaged in combat duty. It is the first training mission by American troops in Ukraine since the war in the southeast began.The training program is modest assistance to Ukraine's war effort, falling short of the lethal aid, like sophisticated antitank weapons, that Ukrainian politicians and soldiers on the front lines have requested from the United States. Last month, the Obama administration announced that it would give an additional $75 million in aid to Ukraine's military, but that did not include the weapons that many administration officials and Democratic and Republican members of Congress have urged President Obama to provide.In remarks on Thursday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said that any Ukrainian offensive would be unsuccessful. On Friday, Dmitry S. Peskov, Mr. Putin's press secretary, delivered a sharp warning in response to the arrival of the military trainers.""The participation of instructors or specialists from third countries on Ukrainian territory, where the domestic Ukrainian conflict is unresolved, could destabilize the situation,"" Mr. Peskov told reporters.The Kremlin's warning came despite a large body of evidence, including the unexplained deaths of more than a dozen Russian servicemen in eastern Ukraine, that Russian soldiers and advanced weaponry were already there. Asked on Thursday to comment on the extent of Russian support for the separatists, Mr. Putin said there were no Russian soldiers in eastern Ukraine and moved on to other topics.The White House rebuffed a request for weapons from President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine in September, announcing an additional $53 million nonlethal aid program instead. Mr. Obama has signaled privately that he is reluctant to arm Ukraine despite increasing pressure from both parties in Congress.Russian officials regularly blame the West for provoking the conflict in Ukraine, and in February, Mr. Putin said he had proof that the West was already providing weapons to Kiev. State and pro-Kremlin news networks have broadcast many lurid and dubious accounts of Western interference, including breathless stories of dark-skinned and English-speaking paramilitaries terrorizing local residents in eastern Ukraine.In a statement, Maj. Jose Mendez, an operations officer for the 173rd Airborne, said the training would focus on ""on war fighting functions, as well as training to sustain and increase the professionalism and proficiency of military staffs.""Several dozen British soldiers began conducting military training last month, and Canada and Poland have pledged to send military trainers this year.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
American Naval Force Off Yemen Gets Credit After Iranian Convoy Turns Away:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Pentagon officials on Friday credited the deployment of an American aircraft carrier group in waters off the coast of Yemen for a decision by Iran to turn back a naval convoy suspected of carrying weapons bound for Shiite rebels.Although it was unusual to dispatch such a large American naval force to the Arabian Sea on an interdiction and deterrence mission, Pentagon officials said the deployment -- and Iran's apparent response -- had lowered tensions in the continuing regional proxy war between Tehran and Saudi Arabia.The nine-ship Iranian convoy had turned north and east near the coast of Oman, in the direction of Iran, Defense Department officials said.Col. Steven H. Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said, ""We do not know their future intentions,"" but added that ""it's fair to say that, yes, this appears to be a de-escalation of some of the tensions.""Earlier this week, the convoy had been on a course toward the Yemeni port of Aden, prompting Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter to call on Iran to avoid ""fanning the flames"" of the conflict by delivery weapons.The United States Navy diverted the aircraft carrier group led by the Theodore Roosevelt from its usual position in the Arabian Gulf, through the Strait of Hormuz and into the Arabian Sea to join other American forces conducting maritime security operations in the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden.Defense Department officials said point of the move was twofold: One objective was to reassure Saudi Arabia that the United States was serious in its intent to support gulf allies that have been waging war in Yemen -- even though President Obama had no intention of actually using the carrier group to launch American strikes in Yemen. The second was to send a message to Iran that the United States would not allow weapons shipments to Houthi rebels in Yemen -- even though that same message could have been delivered with a smaller vessel such as a Naval frigate.Defense Department officials privately made the case that, while deploying an aircraft carrier group may have been more than was required, the move got the point across to Iran.""There's very few assets the U.S. military has at its disposal with more deterrent effect than a U.S. aircraft carrier,"" one Defense Department official said, speaking on ground rules of anonymity to discuss internal planning.The official said that while the United States was not planning to launch airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen from the carrier, it was ""important that the Saudis know that we have an arm around their shoulder.""For a month, Saudi Arabia has launched airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. The Obama administration has sided with its Arab ally in the fight, but in recent days has sought to persuade Saudi Arabia to ease off its air campaign as civilian casualties mounted and seek political negotiations. The Saudi airstrikes, though, have continued.Defense Department officials said there were no communications between the American and Iranian ships, and they could not say what type of cargo was being transported, although an arms shipment was suspected.It was unclear whether the United States would have tried to board or stop the Iranian convoy if it had continued toward Yemen; such a move would have risked escalating the conflict in Yemen, and could have stymied fragile negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program.Also Friday, Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's former president and the Houthis' most important ally in the conflict, issued a statement calling on the Houthis to implement United Nations resolutions that require them to withdraw from territory they have occupied, in return for an end to the ""aggression"" by the Saudi-led coalition.Mr. Saleh has remained one of Yemen's most stubbornly resilient and powerful political figures, despite stepping down in 2012 after a domestic uprising against his rule.It was not clear whether his comments on Friday, including a call for warring parties to ""stop fighting"" and engage in dialogue, amounted to another survival tactic or were a genuine attempt to end the conflict.There was no sign that Mr. Saleh's own loyalists were standing down or withdrawing, including from the southern port city of Aden. Units close to Mr. Saleh have made up the bulk of the force fighting in Aden against local southern separatist militiamen, and are accused, along with the Houthis, of carrying out a brutal siege of the city.",1.0
First Evidence of a Blunder: 2 Extra Bodies:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The first sign that something had gone terribly wrong was when officers from the C.I.A. saw that six bodies had been pulled from the rubble instead of four.For weeks, drones had watched the movements of four men around a compound in the Shawal Valley. After the drones struck on Jan. 15, the agency thought that only those four had died.But when six bodies were taken from the wreckage and hastily buried, it was a clear signal that the spy agency had made a deadly mistake. It took weeks for the extent of the disaster to be revealed: The two additional bodies were those of an American and an Italian hostage. One of them was Warren Weinstein, from Rockville, Md., a veteran aid worker who had been held by Al Qaeda since 2011.President Obama said Thursday that his administration was investigating the botched drone strike, carried out in the thickly forested valley that straddles North and South Waziristan in the lawless region of western Pakistan. But serious questions have already emerged -- about the intelligence leading up to the strike, about when American officials knew that the hostages had been killed, and about why it took the White House so long to go public with the information.The weeks leading up to the strike followed a familiar pattern.Armed C.I.A. drones launched from a base in eastern Afghanistan flew over the border into the Shawal Valley, a favored hide-out of militants, and settled into a routine of spying on the comings and goings at a compound in the village of Wacha Dara. The drones monitored the ""pattern of life"" of a group suspected of being militants, believed to be Qaeda operatives and possibly members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, several American officials said.Analysts also eavesdropped on cellphone conversations, another step taken to determine the identities of the suspects and what kind of threat they posed.In Pakistan, unlike elsewhere in the world, the White House permits the C.I.A. to carry out drone strikes without knowing the identities of the people the agency is trying to kill. These ""signature strikes,"" based on patterns of behavior rather than intelligence about specific people, have been criticized in the past as generating a higher number of civilian deaths.American officials acknowledged that the Jan. 15 attack was a signature strike, but said that the C.I.A. had assessed with ""high confidence"" that the compound in the Shawal Valley was being used by Qaeda operatives. The officials said that before every drone strike, whether in Pakistan or elsewhere, the agency must have ""near certainty"" that no civilians will be killed.The strike was conducted despite Mr. Obama's indication in a speech in 2013 that the C.I.A. would no longer conduct such signature strikes after 2014, when American ""combat operations"" in Afghanistan were scheduled to end. Several American officials said Thursday that the deadline had not been enforced.At no time during the weeks of surveillance in the Shawal Valley, the American officials said, did analysts detect any signs that the militants were holding Mr. Weinstein or Giovanni Lo Porto, an Italian aid worker held in Pakistan since 2012.It was not until after the drone strike that C.I.A. analysts -- poring over drone video feeds, satellite data, electronic intercepts of cellphone conversations and informants' reports -- determined that six people had been hauled from the rubble and that there were six graves.""There were two more burials than we expected, and we didn't know who they were,"" said one American official briefed on the investigation.Then, when the C.I.A. pressed informants on the ground for more information and sifted through more intercepts, analysts began hearing ominous talk that ""Westerners"" had been killed.Within weeks of the strike, American intelligence agencies began to pick up information that Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Lo Porto might be dead -- without piecing together that it was the C.I.A. strike that had killed them.The F.B.I. alerted Mr. Weinstein's family in early February that he might have died, according to two American officials and a consultant working on the case, although the F.B.I. was not wholly certain of its information at the time.""They were hearing reports that he was dead and thought it was significant enough to tell his wife,"" said the consultant, who requested anonymity in order to be able to speak about the classified matter. ""But she continued to hold out hope.""At that time, the consultant said, the family assumed that if Mr. Weinstein had died, it was from an illness. The 73-year-old had looked increasingly gaunt and unwell in successive videos that Al Qaeda released during the years the group held him, the most recent this past August, when Al Qaeda addressed the man's family directly and said, ""Your government wants Warren Weinstein to die in prison so that it may absolve itself of responsibility in his case.""After the F.B.I. alerted the Weinstein family, investigators continued to pursue numerous leads and scraps of information. With no ability to send investigators into the tribal areas to gather evidence or talk to possible witnesses, analysts had to piece together a mosaic of information, including more intercepted electronic communications, to try to come to a firm conclusion.American officials eventually determined that the two hostages had either been in the compound before the surveillance began and had never been moved, or had somehow been slipped into the compound during a gap in the American surveillance.""It was in the course of following up on those intelligence leads, and developing intelligence from a wide variety of sources, that the intelligence community was able to assess with high confidence that Dr. Weinstein had been killed,"" Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Thursday.Initial news media reports about that strike were hazy. Some news outlets suggested that fighters loyal to Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a Taliban-affiliated warlord who holds sway in North Waziristan, had been targeted. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry issued a short statement condemning the drone strike.Mr. Obama was finally briefed about the conclusions of the investigation this month. Intelligence officials also briefed members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees that a strong body of evidence indicated that the two aid workers had been killed in the strike.On Wednesday, the day before his announcement, Mr. Obama called Mr. Weinstein's widow, Elaine, and Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, to notify them that the two hostages had been killed during the C.I.A. operation.The bodies of Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Lo Porto remain in Shawal, a long swooping valley walled by snow-dusted peaks. They are buried there along with the bodies of the other four men, not far from the site of the American strike.",1.0
"Putin Bolsters His Forces Near Ukraine, U.S. Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"WASHINGTON -- In a sign that the tense crisis in Ukraine could soon escalate, Russia has continued to deploy air defense systems in eastern Ukraine and has built up its forces near the border, American officials said on Wednesday.Western officials are not sure if the military moves are preparations for a new Russian-backed offensive that would be intended to help the separatists seize additional territory.Some analysts say that President Vladimir V. Putin may not want to act before the European Union reassesses in June whether to ease or keep the economic sanctions it has imposed on Russia because of its annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine. Others say it is possible that Russia is making the moves to increase the pressure on the Ukrainian government to make concessions to the separatists on political and constitutional issues.Either way, the new military activity is a major concern because it has significantly reduced the amount of warning that Ukraine and its Western supporters would have if Russian forces and separatists mounted a joint offensive. And some of Russia's actions, American officials say, are flagrant violations of the cease-fire agreement that European nations negotiated with Russia and Ukraine in February.""This is the highest amount of Russian air defense equipment in eastern Ukraine since August,"" Marie Harf, the State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement. ""Combined Russian-separatist forces continue to violate the terms of the 'Minsk 2' agreement signed in mid-February.""In recent weeks, the war of words over Ukraine has intensified. Last week, Russia charged that a modest program to train Ukraine's national guard that 300 American troops are carrying out in western Ukraine could ""destabilize the situation.""To respond to this and other Russian allegations, the Obama administration declassified intelligence describing a range of Russian military activities in and near Ukraine, which was included in Ms. Harf's statement.Some of the Russian military's air defense systems in Ukraine have been moved closer to the front lines, her statement noted. The Russian military and separatists have also kept substantial communications and other ""command and control"" equipment in eastern Ukraine that would be needed to organize an attack.In addition, the Russian military has been providing extensive training for separatists in eastern Ukraine. Western officials said such training might indicate that the Russian military was looking to play a less obvious role and avoid a possible expansion of sanctions should hostilities resume.The use of Russian reconnaissance drones in the training exercises ""leaves no doubt that Russia is involved in the training,"" Ms. Harf's statement said.Even as it has been training the separatists, the Russian military has been engaged in a buildup near Russia's border with Ukraine.""After maintaining a relatively steady presence along the border, Russia is sending additional units there,"" Ms. Harf's statement said. ""These forces will give Russia its largest presence on the border since October 2014.""The State Department did not say how many Russian troops were arrayed on the border, including near the Russian city of Belgorod. But one Western official, who asked not to be identified because he was discussing intelligence reports, said Russia had moved 12 battalion tactical groups close to the border. The number of troops in such units can vary, but a battalion could have about 1,000 troops.The cease-fire agreement that was negotiated in February in Minsk, Belarus, was supposed to ease political tensions and put an end to the bitter conflict. Germany and France negotiated that accord with Russia and Ukraine. It called for the pulling back of heavy weapons, the removal of foreign forces and the disarming of ""illegal groups.""The Obama administration did not send an official to those talks, but it was in close touch with European officials when the agreement was being negotiated.""Combined Russian-separatist forces maintain a sizable number of artillery pieces and multiple rocket launchers within areas prohibited under the Minsk accords,"" Ms. Harf's statement said. ""Russia has continued to ship heavy weapons into eastern Ukraine.""",1.0
Clashes Intensify Between Armenia and Azerbaijan Over Disputed Land:   [Foreign Desk ],,"AGDAM, Azerbaijan -- Overshadowed by the fighting in Ukraine, another armed conflict in the former Soviet Union -- between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh -- has escalated with deadly ferocity in recent months, killing dozens of soldiers on each side and pushing the countries perilously close to open war.The month of January was heavily stained by blood, with repeated gun battles and volleys of artillery and rocket fire. Two Armenian soldiers were killed and several wounded in a fierce gunfight on Jan. 23 along the conflict's northern front. That set off a weekend of violence including grenade and mortar attacks that killed at least three Azerbaijani soldiers.The most recent clashes prompted an unusually pointed rebuke by international mediators who met on Monday in Krakow, Poland, with the Azerbaijani foreign minister, Elmar Mammadyarov.""The rise in violence that began last year must stop,"" the mediators, from France, Russia and the United States, said in a joint statement, adding, ""We called on Azerbaijan to observe its commitments to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. We also called on Armenia to take all measures to reduce tensions.""Instead, the violence has continued.On Thursday, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry said it had shot down a drone not far from Agdam, an Azerbaijani city that was once home to more than 40,000 people but has been a ghost town for more than 20 years since its occupation by Armenian forces.Tensions are expected to grow even further this year as Armenia prepares to commemorate in April the 100th anniversary of the genocide against Armenians in Turkey.While the fighting here often seems to be an isolated dispute over a mountainous patch of land that no one else wants -- roughly midway between the Armenian capital, Yerevan, and the Azerbaijani capital, Baku -- the conflict poses an ever-present danger by threatening to draw in bigger powers, including Russia, Turkey and Iran.It also provides a chilling warning of what could be in store for Ukraine, where many fear Russia is intent on turning the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk into a similar permanent war zone.The recent flare in fighting has been fueled by a quiet arms race, in which both countries -- but especially oil-rich Azerbaijan -- have built up arsenals of ever more powerful weapons.Russia is the main supplier to each side, even as it claims a leadership role in international peace negotiations, known as the Minsk Group process, which it chairs with the United States and France.In recent weeks, President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan has upped the ante, demanding that the Minsk Group leaders take steps to force Armenia to withdraw from Azerbaijani lands -- nearly one-fifth of Azerbaijan's internationally-recognized territory -- that it has occupied since a truce was signed in 1994.""Measures must be taken,"" Mr. Aliyev said in a speech to government ministers in January. ""The truth is that the continued occupation of our lands is not just the work of Armenia. Armenia is a powerless and poor country. It is in a helpless state. Of course, if it didn't have major patrons in various capitals, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict would have been resolved fairly long ago.""In his speech, Mr. Aliyev warned darkly that Azerbaijan, which has an economy seven times larger than Armenia's, planned this year to spend more than double Armenia's entire annual budget of $2.7 billion on strengthening its military.President Serzh Sargsyan has responded with his own threats. ""The hotheads should expect surprises,"" Mr. Sargsyan said at a recent military ceremony.The dangerous consequences of the arms buildup were on full display in November as Azerbaijan shot down an Mi-24 attack helicopter as it flew just north of Agdam along the cease-fire line, killing three Armenian soldiers on board.The wreckage fell in the region near Agdam that has served as a buffer zone since the 1994 truce, and for days the three bodies lay in the open as Armenian forces seeking to recover their fallen comrades were repelled by gunfire.""This is as bad as it has got since the cease-fire,"" said Thomas de Waal, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, whose book ""Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan Through Peace and War"" is widely regarded as the most authoritative account of the Karabakh conflict.""Fifteen years ago it was still bad but it was just a bunch of trenches with a bunch of soldiers leaning over them with some guns,"" Mr. de Waal said. ""Now, you have this massive heavy weaponry on either side, sometimes only 100 yards from each other, with these drones and so forth.""He added, ""The stakes get higher every year, and the chances of miscalculation get higher as well.""With tensions mounting, visits to each side of the front line, and interviews with senior government and military officials, as well as conversations with dozens of residents, refugees, war veterans, soldiers, local officials, academics, civic activists and even schoolchildren, found the two sides bracing for war, and neither expecting nor prepared for peace.""We have a saying,"" said Col. Abdulla Qurbani, a senior official in the Azerbaijan Defense Ministry, while on a tour of the Azerbaijan side of the line of contact. ""When water mixes with earth, this is mud. When blood mixes with earth, this is motherland.""Across the line in Shushi, a city whose Azerbaijani residents were forced to flee during the war, an Armenian woman, Anaida Gabrielyan, said: ""Our land is soaked in blood. Every millimeter is soaked in grief.""Since fighting began in the late 1980s, it has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than a million, many of whom have been living as refugees for more than 20 years.The increased firepower is not the only reason the conflict has grown more dangerous and more intractable.The fight is rooted in religious hatreds -- real and imagined -- between Christian Armenia and predominantly Muslim Azerbaijan.And a new generation of Armenians and Azerbaijanis, including the soldiers now serving on the front line, cannot remember when their parents and grandparents lived peacefully as neighbors -- before Armenians were purged from Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis were forced from the areas now occupied by Armenia.Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh, where the majority Armenian population declared an independent republic after the collapse of the Soviet Union, are hamstrung by their unrecognized status, which prohibits most international trade.The republic is largely viewed as a puppet extension of Armenia, with its residents traveling abroad on Armenian passports and many Armenian officials, including President Sargsyan, having been born in Nagorno-Karabakh and having previously held government posts there.In casual conversations, it was not uncommon for Azerbaijanis to deny that the Armenian genocide occurred, or for Armenians to insist that Azerbaijanis were not a real nation and had no legitimate ties to lands they had lived on for centuries.""This is our land, our homeland, and we will always protect it,"" said Gayane Gevorgyan, an Armenian and the mother of two young children who now lives in Shushi, a city that before the war had a majority Azerbaijani population. ""We will do it for our children. We have no place else to go.""Although the long history of Azerbaijani residents in Shushi is well documented, and the city contains two famous mosques, Ms. Gevorgyan said that Azerbaijanis expelled during the war had no right to return.""We were part of greater Armenia even before Christ,"" she said in an interview at the State Historical Museum, where she works as a guide. ""Shushi is not their homeland, so they don't have any right to come back.""In Azerbaijan, there is a city government-in-exile with a single-minded focus on reclaiming the city, called Shusha in Azerbaijani. ""Our only goal is to come back,"" said Bayram A. Safarov, the head of the administration in exile. ""I know every stone there.""The hardened views in the public mind make it even more difficult to broker an accord, despite Presidents Aliyev and Sargsyan's having met three times last year.""The reality is after 20 years of inflammatory rhetoric, both presidents will admit to you that the people of the two countries are just not ready,"" said one Western official who has met both men, and who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations on sensitive diplomatic issues.In Azerbaijan, tens of thousands of refugees live in substandard housing. In some cases, families have lived for years in individual college dormitory rooms, sharing a bathroom on the hall.Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh are hamstrung by their unrecognized status, which prohibits most international trade.The region's capital, called Stepanakert in Armenian and Xankendi in Azerbaijani, has no functioning airport. And officials there do not have a formal role in the peace process.Irina Khachaturyan, who sells trinkets from a stall in the central market in Stepanakert, is Armenian but said she dreamed of returning to Baku, the Azerbaijani capital where she lived before the war.""It was my motherland; I was born there, lived there, studied there,"" Ms. Khachaturyan said.Although she lives among fellow Armenians, she said Stepanakert never became home.""I never found my place,"" she said. ""These 25 years, I have been living like on needles.""",1.0
Ukraine Fighting Continues as Talks Stall:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ARTEMOVSK, Ukraine -- Envoys representing Ukraine, Russia and a European monitoring group opened a new round of cease-fire talks on Saturday aimed at ending a two-week-old flare-up in violence in the Ukraine war.The talks have been halting. Plans to start on Friday fell through when no senior officials showed up in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, where the negotiations are being held.It was unclear how much could be done to tamp down violence and head off new sanctions; although a Russian envoy arrived for the talks, Russian-backed separatist leaders did not.Russia insists that it does not formally represent the separatists in eastern Ukraine, although Western governments have imposed economic sanctions on Russia for backing them.Denis Pushilin, a negotiator for separatists in one rebellious region, Donetsk, said the leaders of the self-proclaimed republics there and in Luhansk, another rebel-controlled region, would not engage in cease-fire talks unless Ukraine declared a truce first.The breakaway leaders, he told Interfax, will otherwise need to remain focused on fighting the war and protecting civilians.""Firing by Ukrainian government troops has to stop, because our leaders are fully involved in repelling attacks,"" Mr. Pushilin said.The top Ukrainian, Russian and European envoys -- former President Leonid D. Kuchma of Ukraine; Russia's ambassador to Ukraine, Mikhail Y. Zurabov; and a representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Heidi Tagliavini -- met Saturday.In a statement issued late Saturday, Mr. Kuchma demanded that the pro-Russian side comply with the previously agreed upon truce and stop trying to impose new demands. ""The Ukrainian side does not accept any ultimatums or preliminary conditions,"" Mr. Kuchma said .In Ukraine, the fighting has grown worse by the day.Artillery shells exploded in Debaltseve, the Ukrainian-held town south of here that is surrounded on three sides by separatist forces and resupplied by only a single, tenuous 31-mile-long road. Shelling in Debaltseve killed 12 civilians on Saturday, the police said. The day before, shells killed 14 people in Donetsk.",1.0
"Iran Releases Cargo Vessel, Shipper Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"A Maersk Line cargo vessel impounded at gunpoint more than a week ago by Iran's naval patrol boats in the Strait of Hormuz was released on Thursday after talks between the shipper and the Iranian authorities.Iran's seizure of the vessel, the Maersk Tigris, over what the Iranians described as the enforcement of a civil court judgment, had threatened to raise tensions in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital Persian Gulf waterway. Warships from the United States Navy had been assigned to escort American and British commercial shipping in response; those escorts have now ended, a Pentagon spokesman said.The Maersk Line, the Danish shipping giant, confirmed in a statement that the vessel and its 24-member crew, forced to anchor near Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas on April 28, were en route to the port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.""Maersk Line is pleased and relieved to learn that the Maersk Tigris has been released by the Iranian authorities,"" a spokesman for the shipper, Michael C. Storgaard, said in the statement.The Maersk Tigris is registered in the Marshall Islands. It is managed and staffed by Rickmers Shipmanagement, a subsidiary of Rickmers Group, a German maritime services company, which reported that the crew was in good condition. The resolution reflected what analysts called a desire by Iran and the United States to avert sabotaging the nuclear talks between Iran and a group of six powers that includes the United States.",1.0
Top Qaeda Figure Dies in Yemen Drone Strike:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- An American drone strike in a southern port city of Yemen last month killed a senior operative of the Qaeda branch in that country who had recently emerged as a public face of the group, it announced on Thursday.The Qaeda operative, Nasr bin Ali al-Ansi, had appeared in some of the group's most significant public announcements, including a video claiming credit for the deadly attack on the French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo. A statement disseminated by the group, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, known as A.Q.A.P., said that Mr. Ansi had died along with his son and six Qaeda fighters during a strike in the port city of Mukalla.The news of Mr. Ansi's death came as American drone operations were under new scrutiny. Last month, President Obama announced that a C.I.A. drone strike in Pakistan in January had inadvertently killed two Western hostages, including an American aid worker, Warren Weinstein.American officials would not confirm the death of Mr. Ansi or say whether there had been an operation intended to kill him. Spokesmen for the White House and the C.I.A. declined to comment. A spokesman for the National Counterterrorism Center referred questions to the Pentagon, but Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter declined to provide details about the strike during a news conference on Thursday.""We just don't talk about those, and certainly not from this podium,"" he said.Mr. Ansi acted as an A.Q.A.P. spokesman in a December video in which he issued an ultimatum to the United States that the group would kill the American hostage Luke Somers if the government did not meet A.Q.A.P.'s demands within three days. Mr. Somers was killed on the day the deadline expired, after a failed rescue effort by American Special Operations troops.He appeared in another video the next month, after two gunmen stormed the office of Charlie Hebdo. The attack killed 12 people, including its editorial director, Stéphane Charbonnier, whose caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad had put him on Al Qaeda's most wanted list. American officials later confirmed that one of the gunmen had received military training in an A.Q.A.P. camp in Yemen.An A.Q.A.P. online obituary of Mr. Ansi said that he was born in 1975 in Taiz, a Yemeni city in the highlands above the Red Sea. He fought in Bosnia and later in Afghanistan, where he met Osama bin Laden, according to a translation of the obituary by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks extremist messages.""The knight dismounted from his horse after long years spent traveling between various fields of jihad in the east and west of the land, from the Philippines to Kashmir, and from Afghanistan and Tajikistan to Yemen,"" said the obituary. ""He waged jihad with his teeth and his tongue.""Yemen for years has been wracked by poverty, civil war and terrorism. It has been further destabilized in recent months by a Shiite rebel group's takeover of the capital, Sana, and a bombing campaign led by Saudi Arabia to oust the group from the city.A.Q.A.P. appears to be capitalizing on the chaos, expanding the territory it controls in the southern part of the country.Since President Obama announced the death of Mr. Weinstein last month, some lawmakers have tried to breathe life into an administration proposal to move the bulk of drone operations from the C.I.A. to the Pentagon. Two years ago, the White House announced its intention to make the shift, but the initiative has stalled mostly.One of the stated reasons for having the Pentagon run the drone program is that it would bring greater transparency to a program that remains classified, even if it is hardly a secret.Mr. Carter, the defense secretary, said on Thursday that the Pentagon was ready to assume control of the program if asked, and that Mr. Obama believed ""in being as transparent as we possibly can with all the measures we take to protect America.""But, he quickly added that he could not discuss where the strikes take place, ""because that's in the nature of things.""",1.0
Europe; Ukraine: Soldiers Die in Strife in the Separatist East,,"Ukrainian military officials said Wednesday that five soldiers had been killed and 12 wounded in fighting in the separatist east, casting further doubt on the prospects for a months-old cease-fire that has never fully taken hold.

Saudi-Led Group Said to Use Cluster Bombs in Yemen:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- The Saudi-led military coalition fighting a rebel group in Yemen has in the past few weeks used cluster munitions supplied by the United States, Human Rights Watch said in a report released on Sunday.The report said video, photographs and other evidence showed that the coalition had used cluster bombs near villages in Yemen's northern Saada Province. The group, which said it had found evidence that the weapons had been deployed on at least two separate occasions, has not been able to establish whether any casualties had resulted from their use, according to the report.Cluster munitions, which are banned by much of the world, though not by the United States, Saudi Arabia or Yemen, are considered imprecise weapons that spread ordnance over a wide area and pose a long-term danger to civilians because of the unexploded bomblets they leave behind.Saudi Arabia has come under growing international criticism for the high civilian death toll during its aerial campaign, which has been carried out over more than five weeks alongside a coalition of Arab states and with intelligence and logistical support from the United States.More than 1,000 people have been killed in fighting since late March, when the Saudis said their military was intervening to roll back the gains of the Houthis, a Shiite rebel group that had captured large parts of Yemen and forced the president, supported by Saudi Arabia, into exile.There have been no precise tallies of deaths caused by the airstrikes, in part because of the difficulties human rights groups face in accessing many parts of Yemen. Dozens of people have been killed at a time in several well-documented bombings, including airstrikes near a military base in Yemen's capital, Sana; at a dairy factory near the city of Al Hudaydah; and at a camp for internally displaced people in northern Yemen.At least two fatal airstrikes were reported on Friday, according to officials and witnesses.A bomb that struck a residential area in Sana killed at least 14 people, including at least five members of one family, according to officials and local witnesses.Airstrikes also hit a government building south of Taiz that residents said was being used as a field hospital by the Houthis. A local resident said at least a dozen people were killed, while an official Houthi-run news media outlet put the toll at dozens, without mentioning that a field hospital had been hit.Hundreds of other people have been killed during fighting in the southern city of Aden, where the Houthis and their allies are accused of targeting residential neighborhoods with sniper and heavy weapons fire.In its report, Human Rights Watch, based in New York, said photographs taken at the site of an airstrike on April 17 showed remnants of a type of cluster munitions that has been supplied in recent years by the United States to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The United Arab Emirates is part of the military coalition.Before the airstrikes cited by Human Rights Watch, a Saudi military spokesman had denied that the coalition was using cluster bombs, the group said, citing a local news media report.Both Saudi and American military forces have deployed cluster munitions in Yemen before the most recent conflict, according to human rights groups. In 2009, Saudi warplanes dropped cluster bombs during attacks on the Houthis in Saada, their home province.The same year, United States naval forces fired one or more cruise missiles containing cluster munitions at a suspected Qaeda training camp in southern Yemen. Yemeni officials said the attack had killed at least 14 militants and dozens of civilians.",1.0
Strikes on Syria Tied to Deaths of 52 Civilians:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Airstrikes by the American-led coalition against Islamic State militants have killed several dozen people in northern Syria, with the death toll from Friday's attacks rising to more than 52 civilians on Saturday, according to a Syrian monitoring group and local activists.The attacks on the village of Bir Mahli, in Aleppo Province, east of the Euphrates River, killed at least nine children, said the group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is based in Britain and monitors the violence in Syria through a network of contacts inside the country.Since September, the United States and allied countries have been conducting airstrikes in Syria and Iraq against militants of the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL.According to the tallies of airstrikes that the United States Central Command routinely releases, there were several in ""the area of"" Kobani, a town near the Turkish border, north of Bir Mahli, that were said to have hit Islamic State positions, vehicles and ""tactical units.""""We have no information to corroborate allegations that coalition airstrikes resulted in civilian casualties,"" Capt. John J. Moore said in an email. ""Regardless, we take all allegations seriously and will look into them further.""A local Kurdish activist, Perwer Mohammad Ali, confirmed that civilians had been killed in strikes on Bir Mahli on Friday. He said that while many Kurds had fled the ethnically mixed villages since the militants arrived in the area, some Arab civilians still lived in the village.The Observatory said that members of at least six families were killed, along with some Islamic State fighters, and that 13 were missing.",1.0
Saudi-Led Strikes Hit Yemeni Civilians Hard:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- In one of Yemen's largest cities, residents have been reduced to a diet of rice. In another, they sleep overnight in lines waiting for gasoline. Hospitals may soon be forced to close, bombs and shells are raining down ever more thickly and randomly, and in places snipers target anyone brave or desperate enough to walk the streets.Five weeks after the start of a Saudi-led bombing campaign, more than 1,000 Yemenis have died in the fighting, and the United Nations says that at least 300,000 people have been displaced, forced to hunt for food and fuel in a country bereft of both. Fierce fighting in the port city of Aden has killed dozens of people in the last few days, left neighborhoods in flames and set off a panicked exodus.On Thursday, little more than a week after Saudi Arabia said it was shifting the focus of its military operations in Yemen to make way for political negotiations and humanitarian relief, residents of the capital, Sana, were subjected to some of the heaviest airstrikes since the bombing began.The worsening humanitarian crisis, a deepening civil war that threatens to inflame the regional struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran and little evidence that either side is winning or seriously pursuing negotiations have raised stark questions about the strategic goals of the Saudi-led military campaign and the international response.""It's insanity -- here are 25 million people in the middle of this conflict,"" said Nuha Abdulljabbar, a humanitarian coordinator for Oxfam, a British charity. The combatants, she added, are ""condemning the whole country to die.""Indeed, this week, coalition warplanes bombed at least two airports to prevent an Iranian plane from landing; the strikes damaged a runway that was being used for international aid deliveries. And the fighting, as well as a naval cordon set up by the coalition, is blocking deliveries of fuel and food by sea to a country that depends critically on imports.Under heavy international pressure, including from the United States, the Saudis announced last week that they were ending the first phase of their military campaign against the Houthis, a northern Yemeni rebel group that has captured large parts of the country over the last eight months, including Sana.But instead of scaling back the airstrikes, the coalition has broadened them, demonstrating what appears to be a determination to defeat the Houthis, rather than any inclination to negotiate with the group, which is allied with Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. They have also started more aggressively supplying weapons to the Houthis' adversaries, according to fighters in Aden and Taiz, even though those weapons have frequently ended up in the hands of the Houthis or profiteers.Saudi Arabia had threatened a ground invasion of Yemen, but faced difficulties persuading allies to provide troops for such an operation. Instead, analysts said, the Saudis were likely to intensify their efforts to support proxy forces in Yemen, a strategy they have used before.A Reuters article on Wednesday quoted a Yemeni official saying the Saudis had trained hundreds of Yemeni tribesmen to fight the Houthis, though Saudi officials did not confirm the report.For their part, the Houthis and their allies -- forces loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh, the former president -- have also brushed off negotiations in favor of expanding their bloody offensive aimed at controlling strategic cities.And the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whom the Saudis had promised to restore to power, remains outside Yemen, trying to influence events from hundreds of miles away in the Saudi capital, Riyadh.While the fighting rages, the civilians suffer. On Tuesday, the Saudi-led coalition struck near a military base in Sana that residents said had already been bombed dozens of times over the last month.Airstrikes in the area on April 20 set off a huge explosion that flattened much of a nearby residential area, killing at least 36 people and wounding hundreds. Residents picking through the debris were still in shock days later, after the bombing had been eclipsed by more battles and bloodshed.Hussein Mahdi Howban, a 25-year-old student, said the blast had blown out the doors and windows of his apartment and sent him flying through the air. Covered in blood and dust, he stumbled outside to find that the explosion had brought buildings and utility poles down on top of families. ""I saw my neighbors crying, screaming,"" he said.The Houthis' attempts to capture Aden and Taiz, Yemen's third-largest city, have taken a crushing toll on residents. Witnesses said the Houthis had all but demolished the Khormaksar neighborhood in central Aden over the last few days, ordering locals to leave and then blowing up houses with tank fire. Houthi fighters also occupied a hospital in the neighborhood as patients and doctors fled, according to residents and aid workers.As sections of Aden were reduced to rubble, supplies dwindled for survivors. ""Lunch is rice, dinner is rice,"" said Faris al-Shuabi, a Khormaksar resident. ""Rice is the main meal.""In Taiz, northwest of Aden, the Houthi and Saleh forces have been accused of using similarly indiscriminate force, hitting at least two hospitals during clashes.The number of Yemenis fleeing the combat is sharply increasing, the United Nations said this week. Its estimate of 300,000 people displaced within the country doubled in just 11 days.Yemenis on the run are finding fewer and fewer places untouched by the war. The shortages of fuel and food are crippling Taiz and Aden, as well as Sana and other northern areas.Shipments to Yemen have been blocked by the fighting at its ports, including Aden, and by the naval cordon imposed by the Saudi-led coalition, which inspects all shipments, according to shipping industry analysts.Several fuel tankers are believed to be offshore, waiting to dock in Hodeidah. It was unclear if the coalition was stopping them or if they were standing off for other reasons, including their safety, the analysts said.In Sana, people seeking fuel are waiting in line for days. ""People sleep at the gas stations,"" said Marie Claire Feghali, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross who is based in Sana.The fuel shortage has set off a ""vicious circle"" of suffering, she said. Yemen, which imports 90 percent of its food, has received hardly any food shipments in the last five weeks, and without fuel, there is no way to transport what little food is available.In a nation already severely short of water, water pumps depend on fuel to operate. So do power generators, and the cold storage areas for medicines and vaccinations in hospitals.The Yemeni authorities said this week that they might have to shut down the telecommunications network as well, further isolating a population that is increasingly cut off from the world.One city seemed to be escaping the worst of the crisis: the southern port of Al Mukalla, which has been controlled by the local Qaeda branch since early April.The militants have focused on security, and the city has been administered by a council of residents and tribal leaders under their supervision. Though fuel is in short supply, there have been no lines at bakeries, and the shops are still stocked with food, said Faris bin Hilabi, a local businessman.Dairy products have been arriving overland from Oman, and other essentials have come from Saudi Arabia, Mr. Hilabi said. The coalition authorities have allowed at least one ship to dock in the port with a load of sugar, and a shipment of wheat from Ukraine is on the way.Sana has not been as lucky. On Thursday, after workers had repaired the runway at the international airport so flights could resume, the Saudi-led coalition bombed the airport again.",1.0
U.S. Raises Profile in Strait of Hormuz After Iranians Seize a Cargo Vessel:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The Navy on Thursday began deploying warships to protect American commercial vessels passing through the Strait of Hormuz against any interference from Iran, which this week seized a cargo ship in the narrow waterway, though which about 20 percent of the world's oil passes.Military officials said American warships and aircraft would maintain a presence in and around the strait and stay in contact with some American cargo ships traversing the sea lane, which separates the Persian Gulf from the Arabian Sea. But the officials drew a distinction between the new effort, which they characterized as ""accompanying"" commercial vessels, and escorting ships, which would involve convoys led by warships.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter approved the new policy on Thursday, said the officials, who cast it as a show of force intended to discourage Iran from making any aggressive moves against American shipping in the strait. At least one American ship has passed through the strait under the eye of the Navy, they said.The military is trying to balance the need to protect shipping against a recognition that taking an overly aggressive posture could upset negotiations on a nuclear deal between Iran and the United States and other powers.""This is more of a show-of-the-flag presence than any sort of specific threat they're trying to prevent,"" said a Defense Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the policy had not been publicly released. ""It's a freedom-of-navigation issue.""Still, other American officials said there had been growing concerns in recent weeks that Iranian gunboats were harassing cargo ships passing through the strait, part of which includes Iran's territorial waters. Iranian gunboats, for instance, trailed an American-flagged container ship, the Maersk Kensington, through the strait last Friday.Then, on Tuesday, Iranian forces fired shots across the bow of the Maersk Tigris, a container ship registered in the Marshall Islands, which has close ties to the United States. The Iranians then seized the ship and detained its crew, which was sailing to a port near Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, from Jidda, Saudi Arabia.Maersk, the Danish shipping giant, said on Thursday that the seizure of the Tigris stemmed from a decade-long legal dispute over 10 shipping containers that were sent from Iran to the United Arab Emirates in 2005.But it is unusually aggressive to detain a cargo ship at gunpoint over a legal claim, and the United States sent a destroyer, the Farragut, to the Persian Gulf after the Iranian move.Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said on Thursday that ""American naval forces will continue to monitor the situation.""Other American officials said the Farragut, which carries a helicopter, was to remain in the area and help accompany shipping through the strait. It will be joined by coastal patrol ships, which are armed.No time limit has been set on the operation, the officials said, and they had no details on how many American ships pass through the strait.""Bottom line, this is a precautionary move to simply maintain a credible U.S. naval presence and ensure freedom of navigation,"" a senior military official said. ""It's what navies do. We'll continue to monitor and assess as we seek to keep tensions low and adjust as needed.""Iran appeared to be similarly aware of the risks of letting the seizure of the Tigris harm the nuclear talks. The deal would ease sanctions against Iran in exchange for Tehran's abandoning its nuclear weapons programs.The Iranian government's Port and Maritime Organization this week sought to keep the two issues from becoming entangled, saying the Tigris seizure ""has a legal aspect, and relating it to political issues could be due to unawareness of the regulations and the case.""The 10 containers in question, which were sent by an Iranian company, were never picked up. After 90 days, ""the cargo was disposed of"" by government authorities in line with local law, Maersk said.The disposal of the crates led to court battles in several Iranian courts. Maersk said that on Feb. 18, a court ordered it to pay $163,000, which the company said it was willing to pay. But Maersk said it was told on Thursday that a higher court had ordered it to pay $3.6 million.""As we do not have the details of the ruling, we are not able to comment hereon, nor at this point speculate on our options,"" the company said.The Iran port agency's statement identified the Iranian company that sued Maersk as the Pars Talaee Oil Production Company. The statement said that the agency had been notified of the verdict and that it ""was implemented by the operational forces.""The 10 containers were said to hold equipment for oil drilling and production.The Tigris is chartered by Maersk, but owned and operated by a Singapore company, Rickmers Shipmanagement. The company initially said the crew consisted of Eastern Europeans and Asians, but has since said that there was one Briton aboard as well.A Rickmers official was allowed to see the crew on Thursday for the first time since the seizure, and the company said that ""given the current circumstances, they are all in a good condition.""",1.0
China and Russia to Hold Mediterranean Exercises:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. HONG KONG -- The Chinese Navy will hold joint exercises with Russia in the Mediterranean in May, China's Defense Ministry said Thursday, a further indication of the closer ties between the two countries and of the navy's increasing ambitions.Nine ships from the two countries will participate in the drills, including Chinese vessels now on antipiracy patrols in waters off the Horn of Africa, the Defense Ministry spokesman, Geng Yansheng, said at a monthly news briefing in Beijing. The drills will focus on navigation safety, at-sea replenishment, escort missions and live-fire exercises, he said.""The aim is to deepen both countries' friendly and practical cooperation and increase our navies' ability to jointly deal with maritime security threats,"" Mr. Geng said. ""These exercises are not aimed at any third party and have nothing to do with the regional situation.""One of China's main military goals is to develop a navy that goes beyond coastal waters and can travel the world's oceans, and while military analysts said the drills in the Mediterranean appeared to be modest, they would be the farthest from home the Chinese Navy has done.""The Chinese fleet has never made any exercises in the Mediterranean, and moreover, this is with Russia,"" said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.""The two countries want to show they have escalated their strategic partnership.""China's announcement came as the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was visiting Washington. He and President Obama declared that Japan and the United States would increase their military cooperation, a move that China criticized Wednesday.With Russia's isolation from the West over the crisis in Ukraine, and with China's concern about a more intimate American-Japanese alliance, it suits President Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to advertise their friendship, Professor Shi said.""Russia wants to show the United States it is not isolated and can launch exercises near Eastern Europe,"" he said. ""And as a result of Abe's visit to the United States and the upgraded Japan-American military relationship, Xi wants to show the United States he has good relations with Russia.""The fact that the Chinese Navy is venturing so far from home for military exercises shows that it has a new confidence in its abilities, said James Hardy, the Asia-Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defense Weekly.""The geopolitical significance of its exercising alongside Russia will not be lost on the U.S. and NATO,"" he said, ""although it would be churlish of anyone in the West to complain about it, given the number of joint drills the U.S. and its allies conduct in China's near seas.""The Chinese Navy has operated in the Mediterranean before, most notably when China's warships helped rescue more than 30,000 Chinese workers stranded in Libya after the downfall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011. It also sent a frigate to accompany the removal of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile in 2013 and 2014.""So this isn't entirely new territory,"" Mr. Hardy said.China's contribution to the exercises will include two frigates and a supply ship used in the evacuation of Chinese citizens and others from Yemen in April, Mr. Geng said. Those ships were dispatched from the antipiracy patrols to carry out the evacuation.The exercises themselves are probably not as important as the message, said Peter Dutton, a professor of strategic studies at the United States Naval War College in Newport, R.I.""It suggests Russia and China are sending a political signal to the U.S. and Europe that the continental powers are standing together to support each other's expanding interests in the face of maritime opposition,"" he said.The Chinese and Russian Navies have exercised together since 2012 in waters off Russia's eastern seaboard.Mr. Geng did not give a date for the exercises, but it appeared that they would be held after the May 9 military parade in Moscow commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany. President Xi has accepted an invitation to attend the ceremony, and a large contingent of Chinese military personnel is scheduled to march in the parade.European leaders, angered by Russia's actions in Ukraine, have refused invitations, leaving Mr. Xi as the most prominent guest at an event that is likely to be further public confirmation of the cordial Russia-China relations.The joint naval exercises come a year after Russia announced that it would sell the S-400 surface-to-air missile system to China, a sale it had been reluctant to make because of fears of reverse engineering by the Chinese.",1.0
World Briefing | Europe; Finland: Mystery Vessel Stokes Anxiety:   [Foreign Desk ],,"LONDON -- Finnish officials said on Wednesday that they were still in the dark about the origin of an underwater vessel that a day earlier had prompted the navy to fire depth charges -- the first such warning in more than 10 years, according to local news media.The episode generated anxiety in Finland, which shares a long border with Russia and where memories of the Cold War run deep. News of the warning shots stirred speculation in the Finnish news media that the unidentified object, thought to be a submarine, had been sent by Moscow.Max Arhippainen, a spokesman for the Finnish Ministry of Defense, said the country was being vigilant at a time of heightened anxieties in the region. He said that such warning shots were a very rare event and stressed that the nationality of the unidentified vessel was not known. ""We don't know what the object was, but the navy had enough reason to take action and to launch a warning explosive,"" he said by phone from Helsinki, the capital.While declining to be drawn on possible Russian involvement, he said, ""We have seen more Russian activity in the Baltic area. To some degree, people are more worried than before.""According to Reuters, Defense Minister Carl Haglund told the Finnish news agency STT that the strange activity had prompted the navy to take action. ""We strongly suspect that there has been underwater activity that does not belong there,"" Mr. Haglund said. ""Of course it is always serious if our territorial waters have been violated.""Finland's action comes at a time of tense East-West relations after Russia's annexation of Crimea and the conflict between government forces and pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.In Finland, Russia has long cast a shadow. Finland was part of the Russian Empire until it gained independence in 1917. Traditionally a nonaligned country outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Finland pursued a policy of ""active neutrality"" at the height of the Cold War, a tactic aimed at keeping the Soviet Union at arm's length. However, since the Ukraine crisis erupted, a debate on whether to join NATO has intensified.An editorial Wednesday in Helsingin Sanomat, a leading Finnish newspaper, said that the detection of the unidentified object was a ""serious event"" and reflected resurgent activity by Russia in the Baltic Sea. Noting that relations between Russia and the West had been inflamed by events in Ukraine, it said that territorial violations had taken on added importance. ""In more tranquil times, these kind of violations would not inspire the kind of concern that they do now,"" it said.Mikko Majander, an adjunct professor of political history at the University of Helsinki, said alarm over the event reflected a basic insecurity about Russia in the region that had recently been revived. ""We haven't felt threatened by Russia for a long time,"" he said. ""But now there is so much more uncertainty about Russia's intentions compared with before.""In October, an unidentified vessel spotted off the Stockholm archipelago prompted Sweden's largest mobilization since the end of the Cold War, and finger-pointing at Russia. The mystery, including unsubstantiated reports of a man in black spotted wading near the vessel, captured the nation's imagination. But the Kremlin issued vehement denials and said the vessel belonged to another country, while Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a Russian government newspaper, accused Sweden of scaremongering about Russia.Last year, Norway intercepted 74 Russian warplanes off its coast, 27 percent more than in 2013, and a substantial jump from the 11 detected a decade earlier.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
"Saudis Hit Airport in Yemen, Possibly Closing Aid Route:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SANA, Yemen -- A Saudi-led military coalition carried out at least seven airstrikes on the international airport here on Tuesday, possibly crippling the airport in order to prevent an Iranian airplane from landing, according to Saudi and Yemeni officials.The airstrikes hit the main runway, endangering one of Yemen's last usable airports and a major transit point for global aid shipments. An airport official said the damage had made it impossible to use the runway.The bombings demonstrated the extent to which Yemen has become trapped in the escalating regional proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia began its bombing campaign against the Houthi rebel movement in Yemen last month in large part to counter what Saudi officials saw as the influence of Iran, which has supported the Houthis.Saudi accusations that the Houthis were acting as an instrument of Iranian power were viewed by many Yemenis and Western diplomats as exaggerated or misplaced. Even so, the war in Yemen has ratcheted up tensions, raising fears of a broader conflict.Yemen's airspace and seas have been tightly controlled by the Saudi-led coalition since the beginning of the offensive. The United Nations Security Council has also imposed an arms embargo on the Houthis.A Saudi military spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday that the Iranian airplane had not coordinated its landing in Sana with the coalition authorities and had ignored warnings to turn back.Iran's state news agency said that the aircraft was an Iranian Red Crescent plane that had been carrying food and medicine. A list of flights provided by a Yemeni airport official showed that the flight had been expected and had been one of four flights scheduled to land in the airport on Tuesday. The purpose of the Iranian flight, operated by Mahan Air, was listed as ""passenger trip.""The strikes destroyed at least one commercial plane on the tarmac, according to witnesses.The bombing of the airport threatened what had been one of Yemen's few lifelines for international aid shipments, to counter what relief agencies say are critical shortages of medicine, food, fuel and other supplies. Relief officials are warning that the shortages are causing a humanitarian disaster. The United Nations said on Monday that hospitals in Yemen will shut down within a week unless they receive more fuel.On Tuesday, the United Nations said that new data showed that the number of people displaced because of the war had more than doubled in less than two weeks, to 300,000 people from an estimated 150,000 people 11 days ago.",1.0
Saudi-Led Air Campaign Resumes in Yemeni Capital:   [Foreign Desk ],,"AL MUKALLA, Yemen -- Warplanes of the Saudi-led military coalition bombed targets in the Yemeni capital on Sunday for the first time since Saudi officials said they were shifting the focus of their campaign against a Yemeni rebel group toward political negotiations and humanitarian relief.Also on Sunday, at least seven people were killed and dozens wounded in escalating violence in the southern city of Taiz, which was emerging as the latest lethal flash point in Yemen's civil war.In addition to the bombings in Sana, the capital, which struck a military base and the presidential palace, the coalition carried out airstrikes in several other provinces, suggesting a broadening, rather than a scaling back, of the monthlong Saudi air offensive against Houthi rebels.Despite vague talk of negotiations last week, there was little sign that any of the combatants in Yemen's conflict were preparing to halt the fighting. Rather, the violence heightened in recent days as it became more apparent that the warring parties were locked in a standoff, with the Saudis insisting that the Houthis retreat and the Houthis demanding an unconditional end to the airstrikes.Saudi Arabia said the military operation was intended to shake the grip of the Houthis on crucial Yemeni cities and to restore the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was forced from power and into exile, by the Houthis this year.But the air campaign has killed scores of civilians and earned derision from critics in Yemen and abroad who have called it strategically incoherent for failing to either dislodge the Houthis and their allies or to force them to negotiate.Nonetheless, Saudi officials asserted last week that the campaign, which they called Operation Decisive Storm, had achieved its objectives and that they would shift from military operations to a political process. But on Sunday, a senior Yemeni official, Riyadh Yaseen, who serves as the foreign minister for the Saudi-backed exiled government, said the first operation had ""not ended.""""There will be no deal with the Houthis whatsoever until they withdraw from areas under their control,"" Mr. Yaseen said, speaking in London, according to Reuters.More than 1,000 people have been killed over the past month, including at least 500 civilians, according to the United Nations. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aden, Yemen's second largest city, which has been devastated by factional street fighting for more than a month.There are growing fears that Taiz, a densely populated city northwest of Aden, is suffering the same fate as clashes there intensify. The city has already experienced severe shortages of fuel and food, residents said.As in Aden, local forces were fighting against an alliance of the Houthis and heavily armed security units loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's former autocratic president.Taiz was a focal point of the nationwide uprising against Mr. Saleh in 2011 that led to a deal brokered by Persian Gulf nations that removed him from power. Residents said the local militias opposing the Houthi and Saleh forces now include many young people who participated in the protests four years ago.A prominent, longtime opponent of Mr. Saleh, Sheik Hamoud Saeed al-Mikhlafi, was said to be leading the opposition to Mr. Saleh's forces in Taiz.As they meet fierce resistance in the city, the Houthis and their allies have been accused by residents of deploying deadly and frequently indiscriminate force. Witnesses said that on Sunday, the Houthis unleashed barrages of mortar shells that struck at least one hospital.Ali al-Sirari, a local human rights activist, said the shelling by the Houthis came after they were forced to retreat. They ""hysterically shelled many areas in the city with tanks,"" he said. Residents said at least seven people, including three children, were killed.Photograph People Sifted Through the Rubble of a Home After an Airstrike in Sana, Yemen, Where Saudi Arabia Resumed Its Offensive Against the Houthi Rebels.

U.S. Says Drone Killed an ISIS Operative:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- An American drone strike last week killed a midlevel operative with the Islamic State who had been a conduit for the militant group's outreach to extremists in North Africa, Defense Department officials said on Monday.The Pentagon said that the militant, Tariq bin al-Tahar bin al-Falih al-'Awni al-Harzi, a Tunisian who had been a ""person of interest"" in the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, died in coordinated airstrikes on Islamic State targets near Mosul, Iraq, on June 15.A military official declined to say how the Pentagon had received proof that Mr. Harzi was killed, but said there was now certainty that ""the airstrike struck its intended target.""In announcing the June 15 airstrikes last week, the United States Central Command said that American warplanes had conducted seven strikes, hitting two Islamic State tactical units, one fighting position, a mortar firing position, an excavator, a rocket system, a structure and a vehicle. One military official said that Mr. Harzi was in the vehicle, and that there were no known civilian casualties.Col. Steve Warren, a Defense Department spokesman, said on Monday that Mr. Harzi had operated closely with extremist groups throughout North Africa and the Middle East. ""His death,"" Colonel Warren said, ""degrades ISIL's ability to integrate North African jihadists into the Syrian and Iraqi fight and removes a jihadist with long ties to international terrorism."" ISIL is an alternative acronym for the Islamic State.Last month, the State Department announced multimillion-dollar rewards for information leading to the whereabouts of four Islamic State leaders, including Mr. Harzi.Mr. Harzi ""played an increasingly important role for ISIL as a jack-of-all-trades,"" said Seth G. Jones, a terrorism specialist at the RAND Corporation. ""He recruited fighters from Europe and North Africa, helped them travel to Iraq and Syria, procured weapons and other matériel, and organized attacks. This made him an extremely dangerous enemy for the U.S. and a versatile asset for ISIL. In addition, his links with ISIL recruitment and financial networks in such locations as Europe, Africa and the Persian Gulf helped ISIL expand from a local group to a more globalized organization.""Mr. Harzi's role in the Benghazi attacks remained unclear on Monday. That attack, on Sept. 11, 2012, killed J.

27 Are Killed by Rockets in Ukraine:   [Foreign Desk ],,"DONETSK, Ukraine -- A barrage of rockets struck homes and a market in the Azov Sea port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, killing 27 people and wounding 97 others, the Interior Ministry said.It was the latest indication that after a relative lull last fall, the war has flared up again in eastern Ukraine, with lethal artillery strikes landing in both rebel- and Ukrainian-controlled regions.A leader of the Russian-backed rebels, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, has said his forces are now on the offensive, and on Saturday he said that an assault had begun against Mariupol, a strongly pro-Ukrainian seaside city with a prewar population of about 400,000 but now bulging with thousands of refugees from Crimea and elsewhere in eastern Ukraine.""We began our attack on Mariupol,"" Mr. Zakharchenko said at a memorial for victims of a recent artillery bombardment of a bus stop in Donetsk. Both sides blame the other for that attack, and estimates of the number of dead are contested, ranging from eight to 13.Mr. Zakharchenko said that separatist forces had also begun an attack on a road and railroad hub north of Donetsk, and that this attack and the assault on Mariupol were ""revenge"" for deaths in the war in Donetsk.In announcing the start of military operations against Mariupol, Mr. Zakharchenko did not claim responsibility for the rocket attack. Earlier Saturday, a spokesman for the Donetsk People's Republic had denied that rebels were responsible for the strike, which hit near a Ukrainian barracks and also killed one soldier. But Secretary of State John Kerry on Saturday blamed the rebels for the Mariupol attack, condemning the ""horrific assault by Russia-backed separatists,"" and calling on Russia ""to end its support for separatists immediately.""Armed with what appeared to be new tanks and other heavy weapons from Russia, rebels in recent days captured the ruins of the Donetsk airport and their leaders say openly they are now on the march.",1.0
War Is Exploding Anew in Ukraine; Rebels Vow More:   [Foreign Desk ],,"DONETSK, Ukraine -- Unexpectedly, at the height of the Ukrainian winter, war has exploded anew on a half-dozen battered fronts across eastern Ukraine, accompanied by increasing evidence that Russian troops and Russian equipment have been pouring into the region again.A shaky cease-fire has all but vanished, with rebel leaders vowing fresh attacks. Civilians are being hit by deadly mortars at bus stops. Tanks are rumbling down snowy roads in rebel-held areas with soldiers in unmarked green uniforms sitting on their turrets, waving at bystanders -- a disquieting echo of the ""little green men"" whose appearance in Crimea opened this stubborn conflict in the spring.The renewed fighting has dashed any hopes of reinvigorating a cease-fire signed in September and honored more in name than in fact since then. It has also put to rest the notion that Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, would be so staggered by the twin blows of Western sanctions and a collapse in oil prices that he would forsake the separatists in order to foster better relations with the West.Instead, blaming the upsurge in violence on the Ukrainians and the rise in civilian deaths on ""those who issue such criminal orders,"" as he did on Friday in Moscow, Mr. Putin is apparently doubling down, rather than backing down, in a conflict that is now the bloodiest in Europe since the Balkan wars.With the appearance in recent weeks of what NATO calls sophisticated Russian weapons systems, newly emboldened separatist leaders have abandoned all talk of a cease-fire. One of the top leaders of the Russian-backed rebels said Friday that his soldiers were ""on the offensive"" in several sectors, capitalizing on their capture of the Donetsk airport the day before.""We will attack"" until the Ukrainian Army is driven from the border of the Donetsk region, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, leader of the Donetsk People's Republic rebel group, said in comments carried by Russian news agencies.""On our side, we won't make an effort to talk about a cease-fire,"" Mr. Zakharchenko said. ""Now we're going to watch how Kiev reacts. Kiev doesn't understand that we can attack in three directions at once.""For long-suffering residents of Donetsk, who have lived with constant shelling, chronic electricity failures and, since September, a cutoff of pensions and other government support payments from Kiev, the resumption of military action came as little surprise.""It was pure illusion that peace could be achieved now,"" said Enrique Menendez, a former advertising agency owner who now runs a humanitarian relief operation in eastern Ukraine. ""None of the sides has yet achieved its goals. The only real surprise is that the fighting started in the winter instead of the spring.""While the separatist forces now seem ascendant, analysts have little doubt that their fortunes are tied to the level of support provided by Moscow. In August, on the verge of defeat, they were rescued by an all-out Russian incursion that turned the tide on the battlefield and drove Kiev to the bargaining table. The same dynamics appear to be at work now, Ukraine and NATO say, with Russian troops in unmarked uniforms apparently joining the separatists in the assaults on Ukrainian positions.While Moscow denies any role in the fighting, Sergei A. Markov, a political analyst close to the Kremlin, says it is not surprising that Mr. Putin has continued to support the rebellious republics of southeast Ukraine even in the face of economic pressure from the West. In fact, the intensity of the standoff, he said, has undermined the influence of Mr. Putin's liberal economic advisers in government, rendering their voices almost mute in debates over Ukraine.Konstantin Sonin, a professor at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, echoed that point. ""The influence of economists as a whole has completely vanished,"" Mr. Sonin said of the Kremlin. ""The country is on a holy mission. It's at war with the United States, so why would you bother about the small battleground, the economy?""Mr. Putin is said to watch his approval ratings closely, and they have risen to great heights recently with the annexation of Crimea and the tensions with the West over eastern Ukraine. In this respect, said Igor Shuvalov, a first deputy prime minister of Russia, continued fighting in Ukraine may actually help to solidify Mr. Putin politically at a time of deteriorating economic conditions.""When a Russian feels any foreign pressure, he will never give up his leader,"" Mr. Shuvalov said Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""We will survive any hardship in the country, eat less food, use less electricity.""Nevertheless, Mr. Markov said, the stresses of juggling a war and the deepening economic crisis in Russia have left Mr. Putin noticeably preoccupied,""We have much less time than before,"" he said of a recent meeting between experts and Mr. Putin in which he participated. ""It was clear to me that the thoughts of Mr. Putin were somewhere else, but not in our room.""The slow grind of combat in southeastern Ukraine that began in April has now killed at least 5,086 soldiers and civilians, the United Nations reported on Friday. The world body bases its estimate on official morgue and hospital reports, and analysts believe that it understates the total death toll. The report said that 262 of the deaths occurred in the past nine days, making that period the deadliest since the September cease-fire.Signs of the new belligerence were evident across eastern Ukraine on Friday.Indeed, fighting has also flared beyond Donetsk, including a road and rail hub northeast of the city, as well as a strategic checkpoint near Luhansk, the other main rebel stronghold. Rebel commanders claimed on Friday to have captured the village of Krasny Partizan, north of Donetsk, which would be another setback for government forces.In another worrisome sign, the rebels were not the only ones taking a more aggressive tone.Speaking to security officials in Kiev after the loss of Donetsk airport, President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine expressed frustration with the broken peace process.""If the enemy does not want to abide by the cease-fire, if the enemy doesn't want to stop the suffering of innocent people in Ukrainian villages and towns, we will give it to them in the teeth,"" he said.Any major offensive by either side would clearly be a repudiation of the cease-fire signed on Sept. 5 and endorsed by the group's main sponsor, Russia. That agreement, always shaky, began to break down several weeks ago. It had set the de facto borders of the rebel republic to encompass about one-third of the Donetsk region of Ukraine.Mr. Zakharchenko has threatened to expand his territory before, but his warnings have not typically prompted much alarm. Now, with the war raging and his troops on the march, more attention is being paid.As recently as a few weeks ago, peace seemed to be slowly seeping into the blood-soaked fields of eastern Ukraine. Russia seemed occupied with the drop in oil prices and the ruble's collapse. The shaky cease-fire was holding. Language on both sides was noticeably more conciliatory.That all seems a long time ago now on the war-rattled streets of Donetsk, where a main hospital was hit by a shell this week.If one were to ask the remaining residents of Donetsk, even those who have been loyal to the Kiev government, whether they supported this new rebel advance, they would say yes, Mr. Menendez said -- and not necessarily for political reasons.""They just want to push the front lines out of the city,"" he said, ""to stop the shelling on them.""",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; India: Troops and Militants Battle:   [Foreign Desk ],,"NEW DELHI -- A gun battle in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, in an area close to the disputed border with Pakistan, left four militant fighters dead, the Indian Army said on Monday in a statement.Lt. Col. N.N. Joshi, the army spokesman in Srinagar, the state's summer capital, said in a telephone interview that heavily armed men crossed into the area from Pakistan and were intercepted by Indian troops.""Militants were cordoned off in a heavily residential area on Sunday morning,"" Colonel Joshi said, adding that the army and the police evacuated civilians from the area before the battle, which stretched into Monday. Colonel Joshi said the army was still looking for other militants in the area.Indian and Pakistani forces exchanged gunfire at two locations along the border on Sunday and Monday, injuring one Indian border guard on Monday morning, according to Rakesh Sharma, the chief of the Indian Border Security Force in Jammu. The Pakistan Army did not immediately comment on the episode.Militants also set off a grenade near a cellphone tower in Srinagar on Monday, the Indian Army said. The police have reported a series of attacks on targets related to telecommunications in the state over the last 10 days, including cellphone towers and vendors of SIM cards. At least two people have been killed.Abdul Qayoom, the police chief of Sopore, where one of the attacks took place, said that mobile phone networks were being targeted because new restrictions on the sale of SIM cards in the region had made it difficult for militants to get them.""This is sheer frustration of the militants,"" Mr. Qayoom said.India and Pakistan both claim the disputed area of Kashmir, and they have fought three wars over the region, which has been scarred by two decades of armed insurgency.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
North Korea Says It Test-Fired Missile From Submarine:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said Saturday that it had successfully test-fired a ballistic missile from a submarine.Although American officials had suspected North Korea was developing such a missile system, the country had not previously claimed to have conducted a test launching. The test, if confirmed, would pose a new challenge to the United States and its regional allies, South Korea and Japan, which have been trying to build missile defense capabilities to guard against potential North Korean missile attacks. Submarine-launched missiles are harder to detect and intercept.""There took place an underwater test-fire of Korean-style powerful strategic submarine ballistic missile,"" the North's official Korean Central News Agency said Saturday. ""The test-fire proved and confirmed that the ballistic missile fired from the submarine fully met the requirements of the latest military science and technology.""The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, had ordered the development of the new missile system, and he inspected the test, the news agency said. It did not say where and when the test took place.But in another report, the North Korean news agency gave a possible hint of where the launch might have occurred. It reported Saturday that Mr. Kim had visited a fisheries complex in Sinpo, a port on the east coast of North Korea, where American and South Korean analysts have said the North was developing a system for submarine-launched missiles.Last June, North Korea released photos of Mr. Kim looking into a periscope inside a submarine. South Korean officials said they believed that the visit took place in a submarine base on an island off Sinpo. During the visit, Mr. Kim ordered the modernization of his country's submarine fleet, and he told submarine crews to prepare to fight in waters far away from their homeland, North Korean state news media said at the time.Mr. Kim called the test ""an eye-opening success as signal as satellite launch,"" comparing it to the North's successful launching of a long-range rocket to put a satellite into orbit in December 2012. American officials believe that the satellite launching was part of North Korea's efforts to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to targets as far away as the United States mainland.The Saturday edition of the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the North's ruling Workers' Party, carried photos of Mr. Kim watching a white missile blast out of the water and soar into the sky.In a separate Korean-language version of its article, the Central News Agency quoted Mr. Kim as saying that once his country entered a ""systematized production"" of new submarine missiles and deployed them ""in the near future,"" it would ""make our enemies lose sleep because they are like time bombs that can go off any time on their back.""There was no immediate reaction from the South Korean Defense Ministry.The news of a successful test-fire was most likely a surprise to South Korean military officials, who have privately told reporters that they believed it would take years for the North to develop such a submarine-launched ballistic missile. But warnings have increased in recent months as analysts detected what appeared to be the land-based tests of a submarine ejector launcher using vertical launch tubes, all conducted in Sinpo.A submarine-launched ballistic missile adds to the range, secrecy and flexibility with which North Korea could threaten the United States, South Korea and Japan.""North Korea's development of a submarine-launched missile capability would eventually expand Pyongyang's threat to South Korea, Japan and U.S. bases in East Asia, also complicating regional missile defense planning, deployment and operations,"" Joseph S. Bermudez Jr., an expert on the North Korean military, said in an article posted on the website 38North in January. ""Submarines carrying land-attack missiles would be challenging to locate and track, would be mobile assets able to attack from any direction, and could operate at significant distances from the Korean peninsula.""",1.0
U.S. Commandos Kill an ISIS Leader in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- American Special Operations forces mounted a rare raid into eastern Syria early Saturday, killing a leader of the Islamic State and about a dozen militant fighters, as well as capturing his wife and freeing an 18-year-old Yazidi woman whom Pentagon officials said had been held as a slave.In the first successful raid by American ground troops since the military campaign against the Islamic State began last year, two dozen Delta Force commandos entered Syria aboard Black Hawk helicopters and V-22 Ospreys and killed the leader, a man known as Abu Sayyaf. One American military official described him as the Islamic State's ""emir of oil and gas.""Even so, Abu Sayyaf is a midlevel leader in the organization -- one terrorism analyst compared him to Al Capone's accountant -- and likely is replaceable in fairly short order. And the operation, while successful, comes as the Islamic State has been advancing in the Iraqi city of Ramadi, demonstrating that the fight against the Sunni militant group in both Iraq and Syria remains very fluid.Yet the Pentagon's description of a nighttime raid that found its intended target deep inside Syria without any American troops being wounded or killed illustrates not only the effectiveness of the Delta Force, but of improving American intelligence on shadowy Islamic State leaders.A Defense Department official said Islamic State fighters who defended their building and Abu Sayyaf tried to use women and children as shields, but that the Delta Force commandos ""used very precise fire"" and ""separated the women and children."" The official said the operation involved close ""hand-to-hand fighting."" (The accounts of the raid came from military and government officials and could not be immediately verified through independent sources.)The American forces eventually entered the building where they found Abu Sayyaf and his wife, known as Umm Sayyaf, in a room together. His spouse was captured and later moved to a military facility in Iraq, officials said.The raid came after weeks of surveillance of Abu Sayyaf, using information gleaned from a small but growing network of informants whom the C.I.A. and the Pentagon have painstakingly developed in Syria, as well as satellite imagery, drone reconnaissance and electronic eavesdropping, American officials said. The White House rejected initial reports from the region that attributed the raid to the forces of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.""The U.S. government did not coordinate with the Syrian regime, nor did we advise them in advance of this operation,"" said Bernadette Meehan, the National Security Council spokeswoman. ""We have warned the Assad regime not to interfere with our ongoing efforts against ISIL inside of Syria,"" she added, using another name for the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS.In a statement early Saturday, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said the killing of Abu Sayyaf dealt a ""significant blow"" to the group. The militant leader was said to be involved in the Islamic State's military operations and helped direct its ""illicit oil, gas and financial operations"" that raised the funds necessary for the organization to operate. Officials said the raid was approved by President Obama.Defense Department officials said the Delta Force soldiers carrying out the raid came under fire soon after they landed near a building used by Abu Sayyaf as his residence, in Amr, about 20 miles southeast of Deir al-Zour, near the oil facilities that he oversaw for the Islamic State.The commandos had left Iraq aboard the aircraft, and were soon on the ground in Amr, a Defense Department official said. They came under fire, the official said, and fired back, killing around a dozen Islamic State fighters.""The objective was the building, a multistory building,"" the official said. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.Abu Sayyaf ""tried to engage"" the commandos, the Defense Department official said, and was shot and killed. The commandos took his wife and the Yazidi woman back to the waiting American aircraft, which, by then, had sustained a number of bullet holes from the firefight with the Islamic State fighters.Defense Department officials said only Islamic State fighters had been killed in the mission, and that they had received no reports of civilian casualties. But officials acknowledged that they were still gathering information on the raid.The commandos were back in Iraq with the two women around dawn local time, officials said. They said the American forces were able to seize laptop computers, cellphones and other materials from the site, which may prove useful in intelligence assessments.The Yazidi woman, Mr. Carter said, will be reunited with her family as soon as possible. It was unclear on Saturday what would be done with Umm Sayyaf, who, according to Mr. Carter's statement, is suspected of playing an important role in the group's activities and ""may have been complicit in what appears to have been the enslavement"" of the Yazidi woman.The Yazidis are a religious minority persecuted by the Islamic State.American interrogators will question Umm Sayyaf about the organization and its operations, but given that she is an Iraqi citizen, authorities there are also likely to seek custody of her, a senior American official said.Had Abu Sayyaf been captured alive, the official said, the plan was to interrogate him in Iraq and then send him to the United States for criminal prosecution if authorities believed they could build a strong case against him. David Thomson, an analyst and author of the book ""The French Jihadists,"" said by email that he had confirmed with sources inside the Islamic State that Abu Sayyaf was a Tunisian emir who had traveled to Iraq as far back as 2003. As a member of the first wave of jihadists who arrived in Iraq more than a decade ago, he and his Tunisian colleagues were called ""Al Iraqi,"" creating confusion over his nationality.The operation came just months after three unsuccessful raids by American commandos in Syria and Yemen to free American hostages.In the first one, in Syria last summer, two dozen Delta Force commandos raided an oil refinery in the northern part of the country as part of the effort to free James Foley, an American journalist, but found after a firefight that there were no hostages to be saved.Mr. Foley was later beheaded by the Islamic State.In the second, on Nov. 25, American Special Operations forces entered a cave near Yemen's border with Saudi Arabia in an effort to free Luke Somers, an American photojournalist. But he was not there; the forces freed eight other hostages and killed seven militants.A few days later, in December, American forces mounted another attempt to free Mr. Somers, storming a village in southern Yemen, but that raid ended in tragedy with the kidnappers killing Mr. Somers and a South African held with him.Saturday's raid into Syria represents an important threshold for the administration in showing that it will continue to send American ground troops into conflicts outside major war zones -- as it has in Yemen, Somalia and Libya -- to capture or kill suspected terrorists.Although Abu Sayyaf himself was not a well-known figure, he was important as much for who and what he knew about the Islamic State's hierarchy and operations, as for his actual job.""He managed the oil infrastructure and financial generation details for ISIL,"" the senior United States official said. ""Given that job, he was pretty well-connected.""Bruce O. Riedel, a former C.I.A. analyst now at the Brookings Institution, said the operation looked like ""a collection mission, the goal to capture someone or two someones who can explain how ISIS works."" With Abu Sayyaf now dead, he said, ""perhaps the wife can do that.""But, he added, ""To me, it demonstrates we still have large gaps in our understanding of the enemy and how it is organized.""",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; North Korea: Shells Fired During Drills:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea fired dozens of artillery shells into waters near the disputed western sea border with South Korea on Wednesday, the South Korean military said.Earlier Wednesday, North Korea told South Korea that it would conduct artillery drills this week near their sea border, where the two countries have fought naval skirmishes in recent years, the South said. On Wednesday night, North Korean naval guns and coastline artillery fired 130 shells, but none of them crossed the disputed maritime border, the South Korean military's Office of Joint Chiefs of Staff said.The North Korean drill comes at a time when tensions have appeared to rise along the so-called Northern Limit Line, a western maritime border that South Korea has patrolled since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. The North does not recognize the border and insists upon a demarcation line that lies south of the Northern Limit Line, encroaching deeply into waters controlled by the South.This month, North Korea threatened to fire upon any South Korean patrol boats crossing the border line it favored. On Tuesday, President Park Geun-hye of South Korea warned that her military would deal ""decisively"" with such provocations.On Wednesday, the North Korean military sent a telephone message telling its South Korean counterpart that it would conduct maritime artillery exercises in waters north of the Northern Limit Line between 3 p.m. Wednesday and midnight Friday, the Office of Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.""This is an act of raising tensions,"" the statement said, warning that if the North intruded into the South's waters, ""we will react strongly.""North Korea has occasionally conducted artillery drills in waters near the Northern Limit Line, and some of its shells have fallen south of the line. When that happens, South Korea retaliates by pounding North Korean waters with its own artillery shells.Armed standoffs along the western sea border are not unusual. The South has often accused the North of sending navy boats across the Northern Limit Line to highlight its claim to waters south of the line.When such incursions have taken place, patrol boats from both sides have sometimes exchanged warning shots. But they also resulted in bloody skirmishes between the rival navies in 1999, 2002 and 2009. And in 2010, the North was accused of torpedoing a South Korean Navy ship in the disputed waters and also attacked one of the South Korean islands there with artillery. Fifty South Koreans were killed in the two attacks.The North Korean notice on Wednesday came on the same day that the South Korean intelligence agency told lawmakers that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, had recently executed Gen. Hyon Yong-chol, the head of his defense ministry, for disloyalty.General Hyon was the most senior North Korean official purged since the execution of an uncle of Mr. Kim's, Jang Song-thaek, in 2013.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
"No. 2 Leader of ISIS Is Killed in U.S.-Led Strike, Iraq Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BAGHDAD -- The Iraqi government said Wednesday that the second-in-command of the Islamic State had been killed in an airstrike carried out by the American-led coalition in northern Iraq, a claim American officials said they could not confirm.Iraq's Ministry of Defense said that the militant leader, known as Abu Alaa al-Afari, was killed in a strike near the northern city Tal Afar. The United States Central Command acknowledged that airstrikes were conducted against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, near Tal Afar on Tuesday and Wednesday, but it could not verify the government's claim.In a statement on its website, the Defense Ministry said that, ""based on accurate intelligence,"" a coalition airstrike had targeted Mr. Afari and several other leaders who had gathered in a mosque. Iraqi state television broadcast an aerial video of a building being blown up that it said showed the strike that had killed Mr. Afari.But it was unclear from the video whether the building was a mosque, and a spokesman for Central Command, Maj. Curtis J. Kellogg, denied that the airstrikes had been conducted against any mosque.In Washington, a senior Defense Department official said that no coalition airstrikes were specifically targeting Mr. Afari. ""We were not targeting ISIS' No. 2 guy,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified targeting information. ""If we got lucky, then I guess we'll see.""The death of Mr. Afari would represent a serious blow to the leadership of the Islamic State. But Iraqi officials have frequently made claims about the deaths of terrorist leaders that later turned out to be untrue.A previous leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, the predecessor to the Islamic State, was claimed to have been killed several times, and his supposed death became a running joke in the Iraqi media. The death of another well-known Islamic State militant, an Iraqi named Shaker Waheeb, has on several occasions been reported by Iraqi officials, and each time he has emerged alive.Mr. Afari, who also goes by several other assumed names, was recently added to a United States government list offering rewards for information leading to the death or capture of Islamic State leaders. The list, which identified Mr. Afari as Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli and said he had been a top deputy to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the former leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, offered a $7 million bounty for Mr. Afari.Mr. Afari is said to be the deputy to the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who himself has been the subject of rumors that he was wounded in an airstrike in March. On Wednesday, Gen. Tahseen Ibrahim, the spokesman for Iraq's Ministry of Defense, said that the best intelligence he had seen suggested that Mr. Baghdadi had, indeed, been wounded, but was still in charge of the organization.",1.0
A Raid on ISIS Yields a Trove of Intelligence:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- American intelligence agencies have extracted valuable information about the Islamic State's leadership structure, financial operations and security measures by analyzing materials seized during a Delta Force commando raid last month that killed a leader of the terrorist group in eastern Syria, according to United States officials.The information harvested from the laptops, cellphones and other materials recovered from the raid on May 16 has already helped the United States identify, locate and carry out an airstrike against another Islamic State leader in eastern Syria, on May 31. American officials expressed confidence that an influential lieutenant, Abu Hamid, was killed in the attack, but the Islamic State, which remains resilient, has not yet confirmed his death.New insights yielded by the seized trove -- four to seven terabytes of data, according to one official -- include how the organization's shadowy leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, operates and tries to avoid being tracked by coalition forces.Mr. Baghdadi meets periodically with regional emirs, or leaders, at his headquarters in Raqqa in eastern Syria. To ensure his safety, specially entrusted drivers pick up each of the emirs and demand that they hand over their cellphones and any other electronic devices to avoid inadvertently disclosing their location through tracking by American intelligence, the officials said.Wives of the top Islamic State leaders, including Mr. Baghdadi's, play a more important role than previously known, passing information to one another, and then to their spouses, in an effort to avoid electronic intercepts.""I'll just say from that raid we're learning quite a bit that we did not know before,"" a senior State Department official told reporters in a telephone briefing last week. ""Every single day the picture becomes clearer of what this organization is, how sophisticated it is, how global it is and how networked it is.""But the allied effort to defeat the organization still faces daunting challenges. With thousands of Islamist militant fighters in Syria and Iraq seizing new territory faster than the international coalition arrayed against them can push them back, a meeting in Paris by coalition members last Tuesday seemed unlikely to reverse the momentum anytime soon.The group of 24 ministers did not embrace any major changes and appeared set to continue on its present course, even though over the past few weeks Syria's government lost control of the strategically important city of Palmyra and the Iraqi government lost control of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province, to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh, its Arabic acronym.And American counterterrorism officials acknowledge that questions remained about how effectively even this trove of materials can be exploited, given the nature of the Islamic State's secrecy and ability to adapt.""Daesh remains extremely resilient, ruthless, and capable of taking the initiative,"" Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the conference.The raid on the multistory residence of Abu Sayyaf, described by American officials as the group's top financial officer, illustrates that American intelligence on Islamic State leaders is improving. At least one informant deep inside the group played a crucial role in helping track Abu Sayyaf, said a senior military official who was briefed on plans for the raid.Abu Sayyaf's wife, Umm Sayyaf, who was captured in the operation, has also provided information to investigators, one senior American official said.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said last month that the killing of Abu Sayyaf dealt a ""significant blow"" to the group. The militant leader was said to be involved in the Islamic State's kidnap-for-ransom activities and helped direct its oil, gas and financial operations that raised the funds necessary for the organization to operate.Since the raid, senior administration officials and top military officers have dropped only broad hints about the value of the materials that were scooped up in the predawn operation, which was carried out after weeks of surveillance from satellite imagery, drone reconnaissance and electronic eavesdropping, American officials said.""In the recent raid on Abu Sayyaf, we collected substantial information on Daesh financial operations,"" John R. Allen, the retired general who now serves as the diplomatic envoy coordinating the coalition against the Islamic State, told a conference in Qatar on Wednesday. ""And we're gaining a much clearer understanding of Daesh's organization and business enterprise.""At the Pentagon on Friday, Lt. Gen. John Hesterman III, the top allied air commander, told reporters by phone from his headquarters in Qatar that ""there is a whole bunch of targeting that is opening up here, as we gain and learn more about this enemy."" He did not specifically refer to the raid.Against this backdrop, five senior American officials provided additional details about the materials recovered from the house of Abu Sayyaf, a nom de guerre for a Tunisian militant whom American authorities have since identified as Fathi ben Awn ben Jildi Murad al-Tunisi. But these officials did so only on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence assessments.These officials described details they said would not necessarily provide any advantage to the Islamic State, and might even sow fear in their ranks that the United States and its allies were beginning to crack their shield of secrecy.Over the past decade in Iraq and Afghanistan, the American military and intelligence agencies have developed vast expertise in analyzing materials seized in commando raids, sometimes quickly enough to generate new raids within a matter of hours.""We've gotten very good at document exploitation,"" said Matthew Levitt, a former Treasury Department official who is director of the Stein Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""Once they grab a computer and comb the drives, this moves very quickly.""Within two weeks of the raid, American officials were able to use information gathered from the materials to attack Abu Hamid in the vicinity of Ash Shaddadi, near Hasakah in northeast Syria. American officials described him as the emir of Shariah and tribal affairs.The materials also revealed new details about how the Islamic State has allocated revenue from oil production. About half goes to the group's general operating budget; the remainder is split roughly between maintaining the oil-field production facilities and for salaries to the workers, American officials said.These workers, once thought possibly to be conscripted locals, are now believed to be salaried Islamic State employees, thus making them legitimate targets, officials said.American counterterrorism analysts have learned new information about the Islamic State's hierarchy. One leader, Fadel al-Hayali, also known as Abu Mu'taz, who had been believed to be the head of the Islamic State's military council, appears to have played an even more important role than previously known.Abu Mu'taz, a former lieutenant colonel in the Iraqi military intelligence agency of President Saddam Hussein, led the council of six to nine military commanders who directed the Islamic State's military strategy, according to Laith Alkhouri, a senior analyst at Flashpoint Global Partners, a security consulting firm that tracks militant websites.The military council has a subgroup known as the Security Council, which is in charge of leading Islamic State assassinations, kidnappings, interrogations and other attacks, Mr. Alkhouri said. There were reports in November 2014 and again in February that Abu Mu'taz died in coalition airstrikes but the Islamic State never put out a confirmation, he said.Although Abu Sayyaf himself was not well known, he was important as much for who and what he knew about the Islamic State's hierarchy and operations as for his actual job, American officials and independent analysts said.""Considering Abu Sayyaf's role, he presumably would have been familiar, and in contact, with Abu Mu'taz, possibly as the point of contact to the central leadership,"" Mr. Alkhouri said. ""Abu Sayyaf's role as financing man is important because he managed large amounts of money; funds that the central leadership would want to keep tabs on.""Photograph In an Image Taken From a Video On a Militant Website, the Islamic State's Leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, Last Year in Mosul, Iraq.

Yemen: Military Headquarters Bombed,,"Saudi-led airstrikes before dawn Sunday struck the headquarters of Yemen's armed forces in Sana, the rebel-held capital, killing at least 22 people, officials said. Most of the dead were soldiers, they said, and the airstrikes damaged several nearby homes. Residents said at least three airstrikes hit the headquarters, a short distance from the city's center. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to journalists. The Saudi-led coalition began airstrikes in March against the Yemeni rebels known as Houthis and their allies in the military and security forces. The Houthis seized Sana in September and later captured much of northern Yemen before moving south in March. Their southern advance forced the internationally recognized president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, to flee to Saudi Arabia.",1.0
Saudi Arabia Downs Missile Fired From Yemen:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- Saudi Arabia shot down a Scud ballistic missile fired from Yemen early Saturday by forces loyal to Yemen's Houthi rebels, according to a statement by the official Saudi news agency. It was the first time Yemeni factions had used the weapon, signaling an escalation of the conflict and providing new evidence that a Saudi effort to pacify the rebels is faltering.The missile was fired from northern Yemen toward the city of Khamis Mushayt, in southwestern Saudi Arabia, and was intercepted by two Saudi Patriot missiles, the statement said. The city is near a Saudi Air Force base.Saudi Arabia and forces loyal to the Houthis have traded sporadic fire across the border since late March, when an Arab coalition led by the Saudis began a military offensive to force the Houthis to retreat from Sana, the capital, and other cities in Yemen. The Scud launching, confirmed in a statement by Houthi news outlets, was part of a pattern of escalating violence across the frontier in recent weeks that has raised fears that the war is expanding, even as diplomats intensify their efforts to convene negotiations between the combatants.The Saudi Press Agency said that the firing of the missile on Saturday was part of a broader, failed offensive on the border carried out by troops allied with the Houthis. It came a day after Saudi airstrikes in northern Yemen killed at least 50 people, according to Yemeni health officials.The sudden appearance of the Scuds undermined repeated claims by the Saudis that they had destroyed the Houthis' stocks of heavy and ballistic weapons with hundreds of airstrikes targeting military bases and weapons stores. And it raised new questions about the effectiveness of the open-ended Saudi offensive, which has failed to achieve its stated goals over the course of a war that has killed more than 2,000 people.Scores of deaths have occurred during airstrikes on arms stores in Sana, with secondary explosions sending shrapnel hurtling through residential areas.It was not clear how many of the missiles remained in the possession of the Houthis, who are allied with well-armed military units loyal to Yemen's former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. Mr. Saleh's forces publicly received at least one shipment of Scud missiles from North Korea in 2002.The United States, which had seized the shipment of 15 disassembled and concealed missiles, eventually allowed the weapons to pass after Mr. Saleh, whom the Bush administration considered an ally in the fight against terrorism, promised they would be used for defensive purposes.Saudi officials said Saturday that after downing the Scud, warplanes were able to locate and destroy the missile launcher.",1.0
Israel: Rockets From Syria Hit Golan:   [Foreign Desk ],,"JERUSALEM -- At least two rockets fired from Syria struck the Israeli-controlled portion of the Golan Heights on Tuesday and Israel responded with artillery toward the suspected launching sites in Syria, according to the Israeli military. The exchange added to already heightened tensions along a once-quiet frontier that has been increasingly destabilized by the Syrian civil war.No casualties were reported on the Israeli side, where sirens warned of the incoming rockets, which fell on open ground. The military ordered the evacuation and closure of the ski slopes of the Mount Hermon resort and the police briefly closed some roads in the area. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition monitoring group, said Israel had bombed bases of the Syrian Army. There was no immediate information about casualties on the Syrian side.The rocket attack came nine days after a deadly airstrike on a convoy in the Syrian portion of the Golan Heights that was attributed to Israel. The airstrike killed five fighters from the Lebanese Hezbollah organization, including the son of the group's slain military commander, Imad Mughniyeh, as well as an Iranian general.That rare, direct confrontation between Israel and its enemies on Syrian soil immediately raised the stakes along the decades-old cease-fire line between Israel and Syria. It put the Israeli Army on high alert in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, and along the border with Lebanon. A top Iranian commander had threatened retaliation and warned Israel to prepare for a ""shattering thunderbolt.""Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli military, said Tuesday's rocket fire appeared to have been intentionally directed into Israeli-held territory, but said that the military authorities could not determine whether it was meant as revenge.There have been several exchanges of fire across the 1974 cease-fire line in recent months and years that were considered spillover from the Syrian civil war, with Israel saying it was responding to mortar shells fired either errantly or intentionally into Israeli-controlled territory.Israel has declared a policy of neutrality regarding the struggle between the government of President Bashar al-Assad and the rebels, but at the same time it has been carrying out a covert campaign to prevent the transfer of sophisticated weapons from Syria to Hezbollah, the militant Lebanese Shiite organization.Israel and Hezbollah engaged in a monthlong war in 2006. Hezbollah is now fighting in Syria on the side of the Assad government.Further complicating the situation, much of the Syrian side of the frontier in the Golan Heights is under the control of rebel groups fighting the Assad government, including radical jihadist forces.Israel has bombed Syrian territory several times, targeting weapons storehouses and convoys said to be bound for Hezbollah, without provoking retaliation from the group. But the airstrike this month that killed the Hezbollah fighters and the Iranian general has increased the risk of entanglement.Israeli officials have remained silent about the airstrike, maintaining a policy of ambiguity in such cases meant in part to stave off retaliation. Israeli military commentators who appeared to have been briefed by officials said that Hezbollah and Iran were jointly building an infrastructure in the Syrian Golan Heights for attacks against Israeli forces and communities in the region.About 20,000 Syrian citizens of the Druse religious sect live in several villages in the Israeli-held portion of Golan, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 war and later effectively annexed in a move that has not been internationally recognized. The wild and rocky terrain is also home to about 20,000 Israeli Jews in more than 30 settlements.On Tuesday, before the rockets fell, about 1,000 visitors had entered the small Israeli ski resort at Mount Hermon. Tamar Durst, who had brought her son to ski there as a birthday surprise, said she heard an announcement instructing all civilians to evacuate the area, but there was no panic. ""The evacuation was orderly, the order was exemplary,"" she told Israel Radio. ""Everyone was very disciplined and returned the equipment,"" she added.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
"U.S. Drone Kills 3 Qaeda Operatives in Yemen, Continuing Policy on Strikes:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- A C.I.A. drone strike in Yemen, the first since the resignation of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, killed three suspected Qaeda fighters on Monday, American officials said, in a signal that the United States will continue its counterterrorism operations there despite the apparent takeover by Houthi fighters.A missile launched from a drone struck a car in which the three men were riding in the central province of Marib, near the border with the province of Shabwa, which is believed to be a Qaeda stronghold. The C.I.A. operates a drone base in southern Saudi Arabia.A senior American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, declined to confirm the names of the victims. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment.But a member of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula identified the men killed as Awaid al-Rashidi, a Saudi citizen in his early 30s who spent years in a Saudi prison before he was released and joined Al Qaeda in Yemen; Abdullah Khaled al-Zindani, a Yemeni citizen from Sana, who with Mr. Rashidi was said to be engaged in anti-Houthi activities; and Mohammed Toiman al-Jahmi, a Yemeni teenager whose father and brother were previously killed in American drone strikes. The Qaeda member did not know Mr. Jahmi's age but said he was a member of the terrorist group.The strike is the latest episode in the chaos that has engulfed Yemen for months, pitting Mr. Hadi against the Iranian-backed Houthis. Mr. Hadi resigned last week after the Houthis lay siege to the capital, demanding greater political influence for their minority group than Mr. Hadi was willing to allow.Mr. Hadi's resignation raised questions about whether American counterterrorism efforts in Yemen could continue, but the Houthis also oppose Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, leading some American officials to speculate privately that the Houthi takeover may not necessarily signal the end of American efforts.Monday's strike was a clear demonstration that American counterterrorism efforts had not abated. At a news conference in New Delhi on Sunday, President Obama said that his administration would ""continue to go after high-value targets inside of Yemen"" and would ""continue to maintain the pressure that's required to keep the American people safe."" Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, on Monday echoed the president, responding to reports that the fall of the Yemen's United States-backed government had led to a suspension of American operations there. ""We will continue to hunt A.Q.A.P. wherever they are,"" Colonel Warren said.There was no official reaction from the Houthis to the American strike, but one member of the movement, who is close to the leaders of the group, said, ""We are against any American plane penetrating our airspace.""He added: ""But they killed militants who were probably planning an attack against us in Marib."" He did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.The turmoil in Yemen comes at a particularly fraught time, just two weeks after A.Q.A.P. claimed responsibility for the deadly attacks in Paris on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The French attacks have raised the level of concern about the group, and American officials say they are worried the group could exploit the power vacuum in Yemen.There are also rising fears that the current political standoff could lead to the partition of Yemen. Alarmed by the Houthis' expansion, the southern separatist movement, Heraq, has been seizing territory, and some tribes are now more open to working with Al Qaeda, giving the group a larger pool from which to recruit.""Al Qaeda in Yemen tried to strike a deal with tribes in many places before, but they failed,"" said Jamal Benomar, the United Nations envoy to Yemen. ""Now, some tribes are fighting along with them.""",1.0
Ukrainian Forces Struggle as Fighting Flares in East:   [Foreign Desk ],,"DONETSK, Ukraine -- The shattered remains of a tank bearing a tattered Ukrainian flag sat beside the main highway to Mariupol on Monday afternoon, a remnant of what pro-Russian rebel forces said was a failed attempt by Ukrainian forces to push into rebel-held territory a few days after a shelling attack left 30 dead in that port city.With a cease-fire in shreds, pro-Russian separatist forces mounting regular new attacks and the Ukrainian military struggling to rebound from losses at the Donetsk airport last week, eastern Ukraine is seeing by far the heaviest fighting since August. Thunderous artillery blasts could be heard from several directions Monday in the largely isolated city of Donetsk.The Ukrainian government declared a state of emergency in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the areas controlled by the rebels, and put the entire country on high alert. In Brussels, at the request of the Ukrainian government, the ambassadors from 28 NATO nations were set to meet on Monday to discuss the situation, the first such gathering since August.Separatist leaders have said they had no choice last week but to end the shaky cease-fire, which had been in effect since September, and begin offensives to push back Ukrainian forces attacking rebel-held cities.Ukrainian military officials said the rebel attacks followed a prolonged buildup of heavy weaponry and troops from Russia, something the Kremlin vociferously denies. However, Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, had some harsh words for the Ukrainian military, which he derided as a tool of the West.On a visit to St. Petersburg, Russia, he said that men were fleeing to Russia rather than become ""cannon fodder"" in Ukraine's military. ""In essence, this is not an army,"" he said. ""This is a foreign legion -- in this particular case NATO's foreign legion, which of course does not pursue the objective of serving Ukraine's national interests.""Ukrainian officials said that seven of their soldiers had been killed and at least two dozen were wounded in Monday's fighting. There were reports of some deaths and many casualties in rebel-held regions, but officials there offered no estimates. In all, United Nations human rights officials have said, more than 5,000 people have been killed since fighting started in eastern Ukraine early last year.Also on Monday, the United Nations humanitarian agency said the Ukrainian government had imposed new restrictions last week on aid agencies seeking to deliver assistance to areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists and, as Jeffrey Feltman, the undersecretary general for political affairs, put it: ""both sides"" had hindered access.According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, more than 900,000 Ukrainians are displaced from their homes, and another 600,000 have fled to other countries since the conflict began last March.Residents reached by phone in Dokuchaevsk, a town a few miles south of that shattered tank, said that shelling had hammered the town all night Sunday and much of the day Monday. ""No shops were open today and no businesses,"" said an elderly woman who declined to give her name for fear of reprisals, adding that she and most residents were hiding in basements.North of the Donetsk airport, around the villages of Peski and Avdeyevka, heavy shelling also could be heard much of the day Monday. Rebel forces in the area have vowed to encircle hundreds of Ukrainian troops camped near the crucial railroad town of Debaltseve, and those villages could be crucial in that effort.The main access routes out of Donetsk -- to the south, toward Mariupol, and to the west, toward Kurakhovo -- were closed to all traffic for most of Monday because of nearby shelling. This came just a few days after Ukraine instituted the regulations making it more difficult to get in and out of the city and further added to the growing sense of isolation in the rebel enclave.At least some shells had also fallen inside Donetsk. At the Central Trauma Hospital, doctors said on Monday that a 9-month-old child and her mother were wounded and the grandmother killed when a shell hit their home.The screaming baby had been taken away to another part of the hospital to be calmed as the mother was wheeled into surgery Monday afternoon, while the grandmother's body lay beneath a tattered blue blanket just outside in the hallway.",1.0
Ukraine Accuses Russia of Sending More Troops and Artillery to Aid Rebels:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- In as clear a sign as any of the unraveling peace process in eastern Ukraine, the authorities in Kiev accused Russia on Monday of again sending regular army soldiers into Ukraine to prop up pro-Russian separatists who were losing a battle.About 700 soldiers crossed Russia's western border into the snowy war zone in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council said in a statement that was not possible to verify independently.They came armed with a wide array of heavy weapons, Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk told journalists in Kiev, the capital. The country's intelligence agencies ""confirm that men and equipment entered from Russia,"" he said. Howitzers and other artillery and antiaircraft systems were said to have crossed the border.""These items cannot be bought in a market in Donetsk or the Russian Federation,"" Mr. Yatsenyuk said. ""They can only come from the stock of the Russian Defense Ministry.""The accusation followed a weekend of escalating and bloody mayhem alarming even by the standards of eastern Ukraine.After first being partly pushed from the ruins of the main terminal of the Donetsk airport last week, the Ukrainian military counterattacked with tanks over the weekend and claimed to have recaptured all the lost ground.At least four Ukrainian soldiers were killed and scores wounded in the fighting, and human rights groups in Donetsk were investigating reports that up to 10 civilians had been killed by stray shells.Beyond the immediate conflict zone, an explosion outside a courthouse in Kharkiv, another eastern city, wounded 12 people in the latest in a string of politically hued bombings and assassinations in eastern Ukraine that the authorities have labeled terrorist acts.Bombs have detonated in centers where volunteers collect goods for the army, in bars frequented by activists who support Ukraine's government and outside hospitals treating wounded soldiers.On Sunday, an unexplained explosion destroyed nine parked cars in a district of Kiev.Russia's Foreign Ministry accused Ukraine on Monday of making a disingenuous offer to reinstate the cease-fire negotiated on Sept. 5. The ministry said the authorities in Kiev had first ignored peace overtures in a letter from President Vladimir V. Putin that was sent late last week. Ukraine's president, Petro O. Poroshenko, proposed an immediate recommitment to a cease-fire in the east. ""Ukraine is ready to sign a cease-fire agreement if the sides stick to the Minsk accords,"" he said, referring to the talks in Belarus that led to the cease-fire. ""Ukraine wants peace.""Both sides in the conflict concede that what they are now fighting over is chiefly a symbol, and a battered, ugly one at that: the ruins of the airport.For the Ukrainians, the airport forms the army's toehold in the rebel capital city, Donetsk, illustrating to residents there that a breakaway region will never really be viable or independent.For Russia, the continual rebel efforts to seize the ruins achieve substantially the same goal: highlighting the perpetual state of insecurity Ukraine will live in, so long as Russia's interests are not reckoned with. Russia's Foreign Ministry issued a statement over the weekend saying Ukraine should voluntarily hand over the airport to separatist control.European foreign ministers meeting Monday opted to keep economic sanctions against Russia in place, despite suggestions in an internal European Union policy document leaked last week that European nations should seek to revive some cooperation with Russia.Fighters with the Donetsk People's Republic, one of the separatist forces, seized control of the airport's runway and taxiways last week, according to Ukrainian accounts, while the terminal buildings were the setting of bitter, close combat. Pro-Russian groups controlled the second floor and above in the main terminal building, while the Ukrainian forces held lower floors and access tunnels. Stairwells and even holes in the floors became front lines.In the tank assault on Sunday, Ukraine's army claimed to have expelled the separatists from the runway, allowing the army to move new forces into the terminal and evacuate casualties.That success soon led to a reversal. Ukrainian and separatist authorities both reported Monday that the separatists had collapsed the second floor in an explosion, wounding or killing an unknown number of Ukrainians below.Yuri Biryukov, an adviser to Mr. Poroshenko, wrote on Facebook that ""the debris fell on the fighters"" and that ""there are many wounded.""Despite the Ukrainian claims, there was no indication on Monday that newly arrived Russian forces were involved in the battle for the airport.Photograph A Separatist Soldier Inspected the Damage to a Hospital in Donetsk, Ukraine, On Monday After It Had Been Hit by Artillery Fire.

Hezbollah Says Israeli Helicopter Strike Killed Five Fighters in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- An Israeli helicopter strike in Syria killed five Hezbollah fighters on Sunday, including the son of the group's slain military commander, Imad Mughniyeh, Hezbollah said as a member briefed on the episode described the attack as a provocative move by Israel.The attack threatened to rekindle fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group and political party. Tensions between the two set off a deadly war in 2006 but have, in recent years, taken a back seat to the civil war in neighboring Syria, where Hezbollah is fighting to prevent the overthrow of a crucial ally, President Bashar al-Assad.During nearly four years of war there, Israel has bombed Syrian territory several times, targeting weapons storehouses and convoys said to be bound for Hezbollah, without provoking retaliation from the group. But with a direct strike on Hezbollah fighters on the ground in Syria, the Hezbollah member said, ""They are trying to modify the rules of engagement, and Hezbollah will never allow that.""The attack, targeting two vehicles traveling in the Syrian portion of the Golan Heights, came days after Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said Israeli strikes in Syria constituted serious aggression and that Syria and its allies had a right to respond.The Hezbollah member, who was not authorized to make an official statement, said the strike drew intense interest because among those killed was Jihad Imad Mughniyeh, 25, whose father was assassinated in 2008 in Syria, presumably by Israel. Israeli officials refused to comment, maintaining their usual policy of ambiguity regarding attacks on Syrian turf, intended to stave off retaliation by allowing adversaries to save face.Agence France-Presse, however, cited an unidentified Israeli security source who said that an Israeli helicopter carried out the strike against ""terrorists"" in the Syrian sector of the Golan Heights, saying they were preparing an attack against Israel.Citing unnamed Western intelligence sources, two Israeli news outlets, Haaretz and Ynet, said the younger Mr. Mughniyeh headed a militant network that had already operated against Israel in the Golan Heights and that Mr. Mughniyeh was planning attacks aimed at killing Israeli soldiers and civilians.The Hezbollah member said Mr. Mughniyeh was a rank-and-file fighter whose importance was mainly symbolic.Israel's strike on Hezbollah fighters in Syria, or any attempt by those fighters to target Israel, would be a shift from the two enemies' tacit agreement not to escalate tensions with each other at a time when each has other security concerns. Southern Syria is a complicated, volatile battleground, an unpredictable mix of alliances, where Qaeda-affiliated fighters operate within sight of Israel without attacking it, choosing instead to battle Hezbollah.Western-backed insurgents, whose fighters have been allowed into Israel-controlled territory for treatment, sometimes coordinate with the Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Nusra's recent advances in the area have alarmed Hezbollah because Nusra has carried out attacks on Hezbollah's Shiite supporters in Lebanon.Syria's information minister, Omran al-Zoubi, said Sunday's attack proved Israel was cooperating with Nusra, which the United States lists as a terrorist group.Moshe Yaalon, Israel's defense minister, declined to comment on the strike, but told an Israeli radio station that considering Mr. Nasrallah had recently denied the group's presence in the Golan Heights, ""he has some explaining to do.""With Hezbollah devoting significant resources to Syria, Israeli strategists may believe that they have more room to maneuver without drawing retaliation. Mr. Nasrallah said on Friday that Hezbollah was stronger than ever.For hours on Sunday, Al Manar, Hezbollah's television network, broadcast martial songs. In southern Lebanon, Hezbollah fighters and United Nations peacekeepers were on heightened alert.On social media, loyalists quickly commemorated the slain fighters, calling them martyrs.Hezbollah also said that among the dead was Mohammad Ahmed Issa, 42, said to be a leading commander. The Hezbollah member said an Iranian had also been killed, fueling speculation that Iranian military figures were present.It was not immediately clear whether the strike targeted specific individuals, said Prof. Eyal Zisser, a Tel Aviv University expert on Syria and Lebanon, but he said that Mr. Mughniyeh was well known to the Israelis. ""When you put a helicopter in the air there is not likely to be anything coincidental about it,"" Professor Zisser said.In addition to several attacks on weapons headed for Hezbollah, Israel has retaliated with what it calls pinpoint strikes at sources of fire from Syria into the Israeli-occupied part of the Golan Heights. (Israel seized part of the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 war and annexed the area in a move that has not been recognized internationally.)But this is the first time since the Syrian civil war began that Israel has targeted a specific group of Hezbollah fighters in Syrian territory.Hezbollah, which fought a monthlong war against Israel in 2006, has struck Israel in recent months, laying several bombs along the border between Lebanon and the Israeli-held part of the Golan Heights, and injuring several Israeli soldiers on patrol.The Hezbollah member said that one such recent attack was in retaliation not for Israeli operations in Syria, but for an Israeli strike that killed a Hezbollah operative in southern Lebanon as he tried to dismantle an Israeli spy device. He said that Hezbollah had not used its new fighting positions in Syria to target Israelis.Yoav Galant, a former senior commander in the Israeli military who is running for Parliament, said the timing of such military actions is sometimes ""not unconnected to election campaigns.""",1.0
World Briefing | Middle East; Yemen: Scores Killed in Airstrikes That Hit Markets:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- About a hundred people have been killed by airstrikes across Yemen in the past three days as warring parties have haggled over the terms of a humanitarian cease-fire, health workers and security officials said.The airstrikes were carried out by a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia that has been trying for months to defeat the Houthis, a Shiite rebel group from northern Yemen. The two worst episodes came Monday when bombs struck markets near the southern port city of Aden, killing 40 people, residents said, and in Amran Province in the north, killing 40 more, according to a local security official. Smaller groups of casualties were reported in separate attacks.Doctors Without Borders, which operates several medical facilities in Yemen, said in a statement that hundreds of people had sought treatment in recent days after being wounded in airstrikes and random shelling across the country.At least 3,000 people have been killed in the past three months of fighting, according to the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. Mr. Ban and other diplomats have pushed for a cease-fire during the holy month of Ramadan, which ends next week, to allow for the delivery of relief supplies to Yemen, the region's most impoverished country.Out of a population of 26 million, at least 15 million in Yemen have no access to health care and about four in five Yemenis need some form of humanitarian aid, the United Nations said.Full-scale war in Yemen erupted in March, when Saudi Arabia launched its offensive to drive the Houthis from Sana, the capital, and several other cities the rebels were fighting to control. The Saudis vowed to restore President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whom the Houthis had driven into exile.Hundreds of people have been killed as the Houthis and their allies among the security forces loyal to a former Yemeni president have laid siege to Aden, the country's second-largest city, and Taiz in central Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition, which is backed by the United States, has conducted hundreds of airstrikes in heavily populated areas, killing scores of civilians, according to human rights groups.The combatants had all expressed their openness to a cease-fire but have so far failed to implement it. Last week, Abdullah M. al-Saidi, a minister in the Saudi-backed Yemeni government in exile, said a halt to the war seemed ""likely."" On Monday, Rajeh Badi, a spokesman for Mr. Hadi, told the Reuters news agency that the exiled government was seeking ""guarantees"" that the Houthis would withdraw from cities they seized.As the negotiations have dragged on, the Saudi-led coalition has intensified its airstrikes, including in Sana, which has suffered some of the heaviest bombing since the conflict began.On Saturday, at least 13 people were killed when airstrikes struck a market, a restaurant and a cooking-gas station in the northern Hajjah Province, a few hours after residents had broken their daily Ramadan fast, according to Ayman Ahmed Mathkoor, the provincial health director. Doctors Without Borders put the toll at 20 or more and said medical teams had been ""overwhelmed"" by the number of wounded.In Taiz, where the Houthis have been battling local militias, at least 16 people have been killed since Thursday by random shelling, Doctors Without Borders said.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
Death of Qaeda Leader in Yemen Is Unconfirmed:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Yemeni officials and extremists reported on Monday that the leader of Al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate and recently the second-ranking official of the global terror network, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, had been killed in an American drone strike. American officials said they could not confirm the reports but were investigating.Mr. Wuhayshi, 38, had led Qaeda operations in Yemen since 2002 and built Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula into what counterterrorism officials considered the most dangerous group targeting the United States homeland, though all of its attacks failed. The group was responsible for dispatching two underwear bombers -- one bomb fizzled, and the other bomber was a double agent -- to blow up airliners over American soil, and for planting explosives in printer cartridges aboard two commercial cargo planes bound for Chicago.It was the second time in two days that the fate of a militant leader targeted in an American strike was uncertain. Over the weekend, American F-15s carried out an airstrike in Libya on Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a leading Algerian terrorist, but by Monday his death remained very much in doubt.The uncertainty about whether Mr. Wuhayshi and Mr. Belmokhtar were dead underscored a recurring lesson from the Obama administration's campaign of targeted killing of suspected terrorists: Even with multiple sources of intelligence, it is hard to be sure whom the missiles have hit in remote areas thousands of miles from the United States.And although American counterterrorism officials would consider the deaths of the two men a major victory, the strikes in both countries took place as anti-American extremists are advancing and government authority is dissolving.In Yemen, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a Sunni extremist group, has been strengthened by the support of Sunni tribesmen as much of the country has been taken over by a Shiite militia known as the Houthis. Qaeda militants now control more territory than at any time since 2012.In Libya, factional fighting since the ouster and death in 2011 of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the longtime dictator, has permitted multiple militant groups to seize territory and recruit supporters, including affiliates of both Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.""The tactical, whack-a-mole approach is not having the desired effect,"" said Micah Zenko, who studies counterterrorism policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.There was no official confirmation of Mr. Wuhayshi's death from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Supporters expressed condolences on social media, while others fretted that the group faced grave internal dangers, despite its capture of territory in recent months, as Al Qaeda leaders were killed, one by one.""Al Qaeda, to where?"" one supporter wrote on Twitter, lamenting that the group had become a ""hotbed of intelligence.""There were reasons to be cautious. The death of Mr. Belmokhtar, who planned an attack on an Algerian gas plant in 2013 in which 38 foreign workers died, has been reported several times over the years. And militants on Twitter announced that Mr. Wuhayshi had been replaced by the Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's military commander, Qassim al-Raymi. Mr. Raymi's death was widely, and inaccurately, reported in a 2010 strike.Dirk Vandewalle, an expert on Libya at Dartmouth, said that strikes were no substitute for a more lasting strategy in Libya, where the breakdown of authority had contributed to a migration crisis as impoverished Africans try to reach Europe.""What we have in Libya is utter chaos,"" Mr. Vandewalle said. ""The American strike shows that we're still relying on ad hoc measures rather than consistent policies along with the Europeans.""But Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, praised the decision to strike at militants in Libya.""You can't defeat ISIS without taking on the Libya problem,"" he said, noting that as Islamic State extremists come under pressure in Syria and Iraq, they must be deprived of a haven in Libya.""If we don't act in Libya, we'll see it go down a rat hole,"" Mr. Nunes said. ""And if that happens, it could spread to Tunisia and, God forbid, to Egypt.""In Yemen, grisly photographs in a local newspaper showed the aftermath of the drone strike last Tuesday that might have killed Mr. Wuhayshi. Witnesses told the newspaper that a drone had fired two missiles, killing three Al Qaeda members who had gathered in a public area near the beach.The photographs showed a small crater on a stone plaza, overlooking the ocean. Another showed what appeared to be a bloodied torso, on a stretch of beach. The newspaper said that members of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula arrived after the strike, asked bystanders to leave the area and collected the bodies.On Monday, Pentagon officials said they believed, though they could not be certain, that the weekend strike in Libya had killed Mr. Belmokhtar. Col. Steven H. Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said the military was ""still conducting the post-strike assessment to determine whether or not our intended target was eliminated.""A militia leader in Ajdabiya, a coastal town in the country's northeast where the strike took place and a public funeral was held on Monday, said it was impossible to be sure who had been killed.The bodies of at least eight of the dead were charred beyond recognition, said the militia leader, who asked not to be identified for his own safety. Some militants survived the strike and were taken to a hospital, where fighters for a local branch of the Ansar al-Shariah Islamist group skirmished with local guards and took their wounded away about 11 a.m. on Monday, he said.There are rumors of imminent reprisals against those suspected of helping the Americans, the militia leader said.Meanwhile, Al Akhbar, a Mauritanian website that has previously published Mr. Belmokhtar's messages, including his claim of responsibility after the 2013 attack on the gas plant, published an article on Monday saying that six of Mr. Belmokhtar's men were killed in the weekend strike.It did not list Mr. Belmokhtar among the dead.The article, written in French, said that the strike hit a garden inside Ajdabiya around 2 a.m. local time on Saturday. It was inside this garden that Mr. Belmokhtar was presiding over a meeting of Qaeda members, it said.An individual associated with the Shabab, Al Qaeda's East African branch, also denied that Mr. Belmokhtar had died. ""Heard from two AQ bros that he's alive, and 6 of the mujahedeen have been killed,"" he wrote in a private message.",1.0
American Strike Targets Planner of Algeria Raid:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The United States carried out an airstrike in Libya early Sunday against the mastermind of the 2013 terrorist seizure of an Algerian gas plant that left 38 foreign hostages dead, American and Libyan officials said on Sunday.The Libyan government issued a statement Sunday night saying that the airstrikes killed the terrorist leader, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, and ""a number"" of Libyan terrorists in the eastern part of the country.American officials confirmed that Mr. Belmokhtar was the target of the strike, carried out by multiple American F-15E fighter jets. But they expressed caution about his fate, saying forensic proof was needed to declare with certainty that Mr. Belmokhtar had been killed. Given the likely extent of the damage -- multiple bombs were dropped on the target, officials said -- that determination could take some time unless terrorist websites issue an official statement of mourning.The Libyan statement said: ""The Libyan government announces that American planes undertook action that resulted in the death of the wanted terrorist Mokhtar Belmokhtar and a number of Libyans belonging to one of the terrorist groups in Eastern Libya, after consultation with the Libyan interim government to take action on terrorist leadership present on Libyan soil.""If confirmed, the death of Mr. Belmokhtar would be a major counterterrorism victory for the United States against one of the world's most wanted militants.""I can confirm that the target of last night's counterterrorism strike in Libya was Mokhtar Belmokhtar,"" said Col. Steven H. Warren, a Defense Department spokesman. He said Mr. Belmokhtar ""has a long history of leading terrorist activities"" and ""maintains his personal allegiance to Al Qaeda.""The United States government, he said, was ""continuing to assess the results of the operation and will provide more details as appropriate.""Mr. Belmokhtar is an Algerian militant with a long history in the Sahel region, which falls on the southern flank of the Sahara stretching from Senegal to Chad. Although his direct operational ties to Al Qaeda may have lessened, his stature as a terrorist leader has grown.Called the Prince by his entourage, he was considered the last major surviving figure among the jihadists in North Africa. All the others have been killed in French raids. He is certainly the most feared among them because of his operational and planning skills.Born in Algeria, he fought in the Algerian civil war of the 1990s. He joined a militant group based in Algeria and took up smuggling and kidnapping for ransom; one terrorist raid included the abduction of a Canadian diplomat in late 2008.Mr. Belmokhtar's success in maneuvering largely unhindered for years in the deserts of northern Mali and southern Algeria and Libya was a result of his masterful integration into the local populations. He married a woman from Timbuktu, Mali; spoke the local dialects; and shared some of his rich takings from more than a decade of kidnapping Westerners.The Canadian diplomat, Robert Fowler, a former United Nations special envoy, was released after four months. He said in a 2013 interview, ""I was always impressed by the quiet authority he exhibited."" Mr. Fowler met with Mr. Belmokhtar several times during his captivity in the desert.Among his militant names is Laaouar, or the One-Eyed, because it is said he may have lost an eye while fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, where he learned combat skills. A major cigarette trafficker, he is also known as Marlboro Man.Mr. Belmokhtar became a leading figure in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or A.Q.I.M., the Qaeda affiliate in North Africa. He was the most experienced of four leaders of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb until he broke with the group to lead Al Mulathameen Battalion, which was officially designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department in 2013.In January 2013, Mr. Belmokhtar led the attack on a gas plant in Algeria that resulted in the death of 38 civilians, including three Americans. Four months later, his group joined with a West African terrorist faction -- the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa -- to carry out attacks in Niger that killed at least 20 people, the State Department said.In August 2013, Mr. Belmokhtar's faction and the West African extremists announced that they were joining to form yet another group, Al Murabitoun. But the merger fell apart, and the other militants split from Mr. Belmokhtar's group. This year they announced they had joined the Islamic State.Mr. Belmokhtar has remained loyal to Al Qaeda. His last public statement was a rebuke of his colleagues who had gone to the Islamic State, who he said had ""violated the foundation"" of their organization.Western diplomats say that intelligence agencies have been tracking Mr. Belmokhtar in and out of Libya at least since a late 2012 spotting in Tripoli. But the targeting by American air power came up in just the past 48 to 72 hours, a senior American official said. Officials confirmed that American surveillance drones had been part of the effort to track the terrorist leader.""It was a strike on an extremist leadership target whom we believed posed a threat against American and Western interests,"" said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence reports.The attack marked the first time the American military has carried out any kind of airstrike in Libya since the NATO operation there in 2011 that helped oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.American commandos, though, have carried out other operations in Libya since the NATO air war.In October 2013, American forces captured a Libyan militant who had been indicted in 2000 for his role in the 1998 bombings of the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The militant, born Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai and known by his nom de guerre, Abu Anas al-Libi, had a $5 million bounty on his head.In June 2014, American commandos operating under the cover of night seized the man suspected of leading the deadly 2012 attack on the United States Mission in Benghazi, Libya, ending a manhunt that had dragged on for nearly two years and inflamed domestic and international politics. About two-dozen Delta Force commandos and two or three F.B.I. agents descended on the outskirts of Benghazi in predawn raid to grab the suspect, Ahmed Abu Khattala. No shots were fired, and the suspect was removed from Libya to a United States Navy warship in the Mediterranean, on which he was transported to Washington for prosecution.The airstrike against Mr. Belmokhtar came as the group's chief ideological rival, the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, has expanded its presence inside Libya, alarming Western officials because of the country's proximity to Europe, across the Mediterranean.Four years after the removal of the Qaddafi regime, the near-collapse of the Libyan government has left no central authority to check the group's advance or even to partner with Western military efforts against it.Two armed factions, each with its own paper government, are fighting for control, and each has focused more on internal quarrels than on defeating the Islamic State.",1.0
Increasingly Frequent Call on Baltic: 'The Russian Navy Is Back':   [Foreign Desk ],,"KLAIPEDA, Lithuania -- The Emanuel, a 90-foot trawler, has what is supposed to be a humdrum job, plying a 30-mile stretch of the Baltic Sea to make sure vessels do not snag their anchors on a pair of electricity cables recently installed on the seabed.On the morning of April 30, however, the Emanuel's captain sent an alarming message to the Dutch operator of the trawler. ""The Russian Navy is back,"" he reported, adding that Lithuania had also sent a warship to the area, a patch of shallow water off this Lithuanian port city.The encounter passed without violence, and the cables, being built to connect Lithuania to Sweden's electricity grid, were left undisturbed. But the intrusion, one of four this year by Russian warships into the cable-laying zone, was yet another round in what has become a nerve-rattling test of wills between Russia and the West over former Soviet lands since the conflict in Ukraine started last year.Cutting the region's dependence on Russian energy -- long one of Moscow's main levers to squeeze its neighbors and get its way -- has become central to that contest, and it is something Moscow is making increasingly clear it considers a threat, both financial and geopolitical.Hence its show of displeasure with the electricity connectors, which include the pair of 250-mile-long underwater cables between Klaipeda, Lithuania, and the Swedish city of Nybro, as well as one now under construction from Lithuania to neighboring Poland. They are the final, crucial link in Lithuania's dogged drive to free itself of reliance on Russian energy.Lithuania's energy minister, Rokas Masiulis, said he believed Russia was simply ""flexing its muscles"" rather than preparing for a direct strike on the cables, which are due to start carrying electricity from Sweden by the end of the year.Russia has been conducting nearly nonstop naval exercises in the Baltic Sea -- including on 26 of 30 days in April, according to Lithuanian officials -- and it is regularly entering Baltic airspace with its warplanes.""They keep up constant pressure just to show they have influence,"" Mr. Masiulis said. ""It is all part of the general atmosphere of provocation and rising tensions in the region.""That has included other displays of Russian strength, or at least audacity, like the abduction of an Estonian intelligence officer last year in what Estonia says was a cross-border operation.Lithuania's foreign minister, Linas Antanas Linkevicius, said he had tried to get an explanation but had gotten nowhere because Moscow declined even to respond to repeated requests for clarification. Lithuania, he said, lodged a series of formal diplomatic protests but ""got no reply.""The United States is also making its presence felt, and it held its annual naval exercises in the Baltic Sea last week with an unusually large number of ships, aircraft and personnel from NATO countries, including Lithuania, as well as nonmembers like Sweden. Russian vessels shadowed American ships as they left the port in Poland.The flurry of Russian naval activity along the route of the high-voltage cables also suggests a more targeted agenda. It has sent a blunt warning of Russia's disquiet over threats to one of its principal geopolitical goals: keeping a firm grip on energy supplies as a powerful political and commercial tool in neighboring territories Moscow would like under its thumb.With the arrival here in October of a huge floating factory to convert liquefied natural gas from Norway into the burnable variety, Lithuania secured independence from Russia for gas, and it is now pushing on with the undersea cables in the hope that it can do the same for electricity. Lithuania currently imports 60 percent of the electricity it needs from Russia and from its fellow Baltic nations.On the same morning that the Emanuel reported the arrival of the Russian Navy in the cable zone, the captain of the Alcedo, a second vessel tasked with guarding the seabed cables, reported troubles of its own.In a message to Rederij Groen, the Dutch company that operates the Alcedo, the captain said a Russian naval vessel had ordered him to clear out of the area until the evening. ""Left location and set course to north,"" he added.""When you are a civilian ship and you get told to move by a military ship, you move,"" said Daivis Virbickas, chairman of the board of Litgrid, Lithuania's electricity transmission system operator. The company is sponsoring the cable project in partnership with Svenska Kraftnat, its Swedish counterpart.""For us, this is not just a piece of cable,"" Mr. Virbickas added, noting that Lithuania declared political independence from the Soviet Union 25 years ago and that it was finally breaking free of its dependence on Russia's electricity network.""We can only assume that others are not happy with this,"" Mr. Linkevicius said. He described Russia's response to Lithuania's quest for energy independence as ""political hooliganism.""Lithuania, a nation of three million people, matters little as a market for Gazprom, Russia's natural gas giant, or Inter RAO, Russia's electricity exporter. But its success in breaking dependence on Russian energy shows bigger countries in Eastern Europe that history and geography are not destiny.""We are a good example for others to follow,"" said Mr. Masiulis, the energy minister. He noted that as soon as Lithuania started importing liquefied natural gas from Norway last year and broke what had been a Gazprom monopoly, the Russian gas company offered an ""instant discount of 23 percent"" on its price.Lithuania's electricity prices are among the highest in Europe, and Litgrid predicts they will fall drastically once the links to Sweden and Poland provide an alternative to imports from Russia.While Russia's concerns seem clear, the exact purpose of its naval actions in the Baltic Sea has led to much head-scratching, especially as they have so far failed to derail or even delay the cable project.Rytas Staselis, a Lithuanian expert on energy issues, speculated that the harassment could be a form of retribution for the environmental and legal hurdles put up by Europe that complicated construction of Nord Stream, a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, and helped torpedo South Stream, a second Russian-sponsored gas pipeline.Another theory is that the Russian Navy's actions in the Baltic Sea are a gambit by President Vladimir V. Putin in a long, grinding campaign to unsettle and divide the European Union.Russian warships first tangled with the Baltic Sea electricity link in May last year, soon after a Swedish engineering company, ABB, began work to lay the cables. At the time, the episode seemed a one-off annoyance.But Russian activity around the undersea cables resumed with increased vigor this spring after a series of moves by the European Union to blunt the power of Russia's abundant energy supplies. The European bloc has put up more than $230 million to help pay for the nearly $600 million cable project, known as Nordbalt.""The E.U. is always very slow to act on any problem, but when it finally moves, it is hard to stop it,"" said Marius Laurinavicius of the Eastern Europe Studies Center, a research unit in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.In February, the European Union announced an ambitious plan to form a so-called energy union, a venture that aims to knit together Europe's diverse energy systems and make them less vulnerable to interruptions in supplies from outside sources, notably Russia.Then, in April, Brussels took a direct swipe at Gazprom. Antitrust regulators announced that they were charging Gazprom with abusing its dominant market position, a move long urged by Lithuania.That same month, Russia sharply accelerated its military activity in the Baltic Sea, according to Lithuania's Foreign Ministry, leading to three new intrusions along the route of the electricity cables.""Russia's ultimate goal is to destroy the European Union and NATO, but this is very hard to achieve,"" Mr. Laurinavicius said. ""Its interim goal is simply to show that Russia is a major power that has to be taken into account.""Photograph A Royal Air Force Jet, Bottom, Accompanied a Russian Ilyushin Il-20m Reconnaissance Plane Over the Baltic Sea, Where Russia has Been Conducting Naval Exercises, Lithuanian Officials Said.

An Errant Attack by U.S. Helicopters Kills at Least 7 Afghan Soldiers:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- In one of the deadliest episodes of its kind in Afghanistan in recent years, American helicopters opened fire on an outpost belonging to the Afghan Army in the eastern province of Logar on Monday, killing at least seven Afghan soldiers and wounding five, officials said.This was the second time in less than two years that American forces had mistakenly targeted Afghan soldiers in Logar. A similar case in March last year left five dead.In a further twist, after the strikes, Taliban fighters on about 25 motorcycles mounted an offensive to take over the destroyed outpost, but they were repelled by members of the Afghan Local Police after two hours of heavy fighting, said Sabir Khan, the commander of the police unit.In a statement, the United States military headquarters acknowledged the casualties and expressed ""deep regret"" and condolences, adding that a joint investigation with Afghan officials was underway.Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan president, ""expressed his profound sorrow over the death and wounding of a number of Afghan National Army soldiers as a result of an airstrike by the international forces,"" his office said in a statement.""The president reiterated that the international forces take maximum precautions not to harm the people and security forces of Afghanistan in their operations in the future,"" the statement added.Mohammad Rahim Amin, the district chief of Baraki Barak, where the strike took place, said that the attack happened at 6:40 a.m. and that seven soldiers were killed and five wounded.""The outpost was completely destroyed; it was fired upon a lot,"" Mr. Amin said. ""The bodies were in bad shape.""He added that a new group of soldiers had been moved into the outpost.Baraki Barak is a volatile district about 40 miles from Kabul. Hours after the shooting on Monday, the government delegation sent to retrieve the bodies was ambushed by Taliban fighters, who were advancing on the security posts in the area. Mr. Khan, the police commander, said their posts were under heavy enemy fire.""After the American strikes, the Taliban tried to run over the outpost and capture the five wounded soldiers lying there,"" Mr. Khan said.Two hours of fighting later, he said, the Taliban were pushed back, and the government delegation was able to retrieve the bodies and take them to the provincial capital.""The heads of two of the soldiers were missing,"" Mr. Khan said.Farooq Jan Mangal contributed reporting from Khost Province, and Joseph Goldstein from Kabul.Photograph Soldiers Wounded in the Strike On an Afghan Army Outpost On Monday.

"China Has Deployed Artillery on Artificial Island, U.S. Asserts:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SINGAPORE -- The United States has spotted a pair of mobile artillery vehicles on an artificial island that China is building in the South China Sea, a resource-rich stretch of ocean crossed by vital shipping lanes, American officials said.China's construction program on previously uninhabited atolls and reefs in the Spratly Islands has already raised alarm and drawn protests from other countries in the region, whose claims to parts of the South China Sea overlap with China's. The United States has also become increasingly vocal about its objections in recent days.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter called this week for China to halt the construction, saying that international law did not recognize Chinese claims of sovereignty over the new territories and that American warships and military aircraft would continue to operate in the area. He reiterated those assertions in a speech Saturday morning in Singapore at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual security conference that brings together most Asian countries and many other powers outside the region.""We all know that turning an underwater rock into an airfield simply does not afford the rights of sovereignty,"" Mr. Carter said.The United States, he added, is ""deeply concerned about the pace and scope"" of China's island building and the possibility of increased militarization, which risks the kind of miscalculations that could lead to conflict.Mr. Carter announced a new $425 million maritime security initiative to help countries in Southeast Asia improve their naval and coast guard capabilities.China is not the only country to develop outposts in the South China Sea over the years, Mr. Carter noted. Vietnam, for instance, has 48, and the Philippines, a close American ally, has eight.""Yet, one country has gone much farther and much faster than any other,"" he said. ""And that's China.""China has constructed over 2,000 acres of new territory in the Spratly Islands in the past 18 months, which is ""more than all other claimants combined,"" Mr. Carter continued. ""It is unclear how much farther China will go."" The artillery was spotted by satellites and surveillance aircraft about a month ago on one of the new islands China has built, and the two vehicles have since either been hidden or removed, according to another American official who spoke about intelligence matters on the condition of anonymity. The official added that even if the weapons remained on the island, they posed no threat to American naval forces or aircraft in the region, though the guns could reach some nearby islands claimed by other countries.With Mr. Carter in Singapore for the security conference, which Chinese officials are also attending, American officials were reluctant to publicly discuss the intelligence they had collected about the artillery.Brent Colburn, a spokesman traveling with Mr. Carter, would say only that the United States was aware of the weapons, whose detection was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who heads the Armed Services Committee, criticized China's deployment of artillery on the island as ""a disturbing development and escalatory development.""""Their actions are in violation of international law, and their actions are going to be condemned by everyone in the world,"" Mr. McCain was quoted by Reuters as saying in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where he stopped on Friday on his way to Singapore for the conference.""We are not going to have a conflict with China,"" he said, ""but we can take certain measures which will be a disincentive to China to continue these kinds of activities.""There was no immediate comment from Chinese officials about the weapons. But China has sent its most high-powered delegation yet to the annual meeting in Singapore; a top military official, Adm. Sun Jianguo, is scheduled to speak at the conference.China released a military strategy document this week that, for the first time, called for its navy to project force beyond its coastal waters into the open oceans. Western officials said that because of its timing, the document seemed intended as a challenge to other participants in the conference.And days before the document was released, China demanded that an American military surveillance plane leave the skies above Fiery Cross Reef, which China has built into an island with a runway that its military can use. The American aircraft did not alter its course, American officials have said.China has said that it was building the artificial islands largely for civilian purposes, but it has not denied that it also envisions a military role for them. ""Such constructions are within China's sovereignty and are fair, reasonable, lawful and do not affect nor target any country, and are beyond reproach,"" Hua Chunying, the spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry, told reporters in April.The United States disagrees, and American officials have stressed in recent days that the American-dominated security order in the region should be respected because it has brought calm and prosperity, a theme Mr. Carter will develop in his remarks on Saturday in Singapore.""It's important for the region to understand that America is going to remain engaged,"" he said, and it will ""continue to stand up for international law and universal principles and help provide security and stability in the Asia-Pacific for decades to come.""The implication is that China is threatening to upend that system, though Mr. Carter and other American officials have hesitated to say so directly, preferring to talk in generalities about the need for diplomatic solutions and inclusive security arrangements.But the island-building has been a major concern of the United States and Southeast Asian nations for more than a year, and Mr. Carter is not the first head of the Pentagon to say so at a regional security forum.At last year's Shangri-La Dialogue, Chuck Hagel, Mr. Carter's predecessor, said that China was engaged in ""destabilizing, unilateral actions asserting its claims in the South China Sea."" The Philippines has also spoken out against Chinese island building.China has countered by pointing to the outposts built by the Philippines and Vietnam in the South China Sea. But analysts say that the two nations did not build islands, and in any case their structures were generally built before 2002, when China and nine Southeast Asian nations signed a nonbinding agreement to ""exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities"" and to refrain from trying to inhabit any land features that were uninhabited at that time.American and Southeast Asian officials are concerned that China may try to claim an exclusive economic zone in waters within 200 nautical miles of the new land formations, which they argue are ineligible for determining such zones.",1.0
Russian Military Insignia Are Reported in Ukraine:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- International monitors tracking cease-fire violations in eastern Ukraine reported Friday that they had encountered four people wearing military uniforms with Russian insignia in a town about 25 miles southeast of the regional capital of Donetsk, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists.In its daily report, the special monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said a young man had reported that ""an unknown armed group"" had occupied the grounds of a former children's campground in the town, Petrivske. According to the report, monitors ""spoke to two women, both wearing military uniforms, with caps with Russian Federation Armed Forces insignia.""""During the conversation with the two women, a vehicle with Russian Federation number plates stopped next to the O.S.C.E. vehicles and two armed men, similarly dressed, exited the car and ordered the women to stop the conversation,"" the report stated. Behind a fence surrounding the camp, the monitors ""observed one infantry fighting vehicle,"" according to the report. The monitors could not enter the camp.The report was a rare allegation by the international monitors of a possible sighting of active Russian military personnel in eastern Ukraine. The monitors, however, did not identify the women or men who were observed in uniform in Petrivske, and there was no way to independently verify the monitors' account.Although there has been substantial other evidence of Russian military activity in eastern Ukraine cited by journalists, as well as by Ukraine and its Western allies, including the United States, the monitors for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have not previously reported a definitive observation of uniformed personnel bearing Russian insignia.On Nov. 13, the monitors reported seeing ""five unarmed men in camouflage, with Russian Federation flag patches and other badges on their uniforms,"" in the city of Luhansk, but noted that they were ""unable to ascertain the affiliation of these men.""The monitors have regularly reported unmarked military convoys pulling heavy weaponry toward Donetsk, said Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the monitoring mission. Asked if monitors had previously seen such clear evidence of Russian military insignia, Mr. Bociurkiw replied, ""No, we haven't.""The Kremlin in recent days has reiterated its longstanding denials that any active-duty Russian forces have been present in eastern Ukraine, despite substantial evidence to the contrary, including dozens of military funerals in Russia during the past year of fighting. Ukrainian forces this month captured two fighters who have identified themselves as active-duty Russian soldiers from a special forces unit, the Third Special Forces Brigade, based in Togliatti in southern Russia.The Russian government has confirmed that the two men are Russian citizens but insists that they are former military personnel who left active service before going to Ukraine.In an interview with Reuters, published Friday, the men said again that they were Russian military personnel. One of the men, Sgt. Aleksandr Aleksandrov, told the news agency that he was in the middle of a three-year contract, which he had never canceled, and that he felt abandoned by his country. ""I never tore it up; I wrote no resignation request,"" Sergeant Aleksandrov said. ""I was carrying out my orders.""The potential political fallout from Russian soldiers' being wounded and killed in eastern Ukraine seems to be increasingly worrisome for the Kremlin. On Thursday, President Vladimir V. Putin decreed that Russian casualties in ""special operations"" can be classified as military secrets even in peacetime.Despite Mr. Putin's repeated denials that Russian soldiers are fighting in Ukraine, his critics say Russia not only continues to intervene militarily in Ukraine but is turning its back on soldiers who are wounded or killed there.The monitors for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe also reported Friday that a separatist leader, Aleksandr V. Zakharchenko, the prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, had told them he was ""unavailable to attend meetings outside the country until the end of July due to health reasons."" This presented a potential stumbling block in efforts to negotiate full implementation of the cease-fire accord signed in Minsk, Belarus, in February.Russia, which helped broker the accord together with Ukraine, France and Germany, has insisted that it wants to put the peace deal into effect.The United States, however, has criticized Russia for failing to live up to its obligations under the agreement and of obstructing efforts to carry out steps required to achieve a long-term political resolution of the Ukraine crisis. The Kremlin says the failure to carry out the accord is the fault of the Ukrainian government in Kiev.In its report on Friday, the security and cooperation organization noted an increase in cease-fire violations compared with those of recent days, including 150 explosions heard from an observation point near the central railway station in Donetsk, consistent with mortar and tank fire. Because of security concerns, the monitors said they could not observe the situation in Shyrokyne, the scene of some intense clashes in recent weeks. But from an observation point in the city of Mariupol, the monitors reported hearing explosions coming from the direction of Shyrokyne.""We do see a deterioration,"" said Mr. Bociurkiw, the organization's spokesman.

,,"SANA, Yemen -- Saudi Arabia said Saturday that it would halt its military offensive in Yemen for five days to allow the distribution of humanitarian relief supplies, according to a statement carried by the official Saudi news agency.A Saudi-led military force has been bombing Yemen since late March in order to defeat the Houthis, a rebel group that drove Yemen's Saudi-backed government from power this year and controls substantial territory.The truce announcement came a day after the Saudi-led coalition was accused of being responsible for killing more than 100 civilians in air attacks, one of the highest death tolls of the war. Witnesses and medical officials said a series of airstrikes late Friday slammed into residential compounds for workers at an electricity plant in the coastal city of Mokha, killing the civilians.The Saudis had refused to abide by a previous cease-fire two weeks ago that was brokered by the United Nations and would have halted the fighting during the holy month of Ramadan. Saudi officials said at the time that they had received no formal request to stop fighting from Yemen's exiled president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi.Their change of heart on Saturday appeared to reflect the Saudis' rapidly improving fortunes in the war. Last week, local militiamen and other fighters backed by the Saudis drove the Houthis from most of the southern Yemeni city of Aden, giving the coalition its first significant victory as well as a beachhead that could be used to broaden the offensive.More than 1,700 civilians have been killed in Yemen since the war began four months ago, including hundreds by coalition bombs.The compounds that were bombed on Friday housed more than 1,300 people, according to Abdullah Al-Fadhli, a local council member in Mokha. At least eight airstrikes hit the buildings -- with some of the bombs killing rescue workers who responded to the first strikes, he said.",1.0
China Objects to U.S. Flights Near Artificial Islands:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- The United States and China on Friday escalated their dispute over contested territory in the South China Sea, after the Chinese repeatedly ordered an American military surveillance plane to abandon flights over areas where China has been building artificial islands.The continued American surveillance flights in areas where China is creating new islands in the South China Sea are intended to challenge the Chinese government's claims of expanded territorial sovereignty. Further raising the challenge, Pentagon officials said they were discussing sending warships into waters that the United States asserts are international and open to passage, but that China says are within its zone of control.The Defense Department planning comes in response to China's accelerated efforts to build new islands in the South China Sea to bolster claims to a vastly expanded area of sovereignty, a direct challenge to the United States and other nations in the region.The Chinese government expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"" with the surveillance flights, while urging the United States to cease actions that they said risked increasing tensions. Hong Lei, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, warned that the American flights, which he called ""very irresponsible and dangerous,"" were ""likely to cause an accident.""But the Obama administration was adamant in saying that the American Navy surveillance flights were made in international airspace. Officials from the State Department and the Pentagon said that China's land reclamation in the South China Sea was undermining stability in the region and that the Chinese had no business building airstrips on the contested Spratly Islands.""This land reclamation is going fast,"" Cmdr. William Marks, the Navy's chief of media, said in an interview on Friday. ""Really fast -- faster than we ever imagined."" He said the Navy had no intention of stopping its almost daily reconnaissance flights.""We have freedom of flight over international airspace,"" he said.The Navy on Thursday released video footage of an incident Wednesday when a Chinese military dispatcher issued eight warnings -- in English -- to a Navy P8-A Poseidon surveillance plane as it flew over Fiery Cross Reef, the site of an extensive Chinese land reclamation project in the Spratly Islands, a group of reefs halfway between Vietnam and the Philippines in the South China Sea. The Navy also released video footage that it said documented the continued expansion of the reefs, which have been turned into artificial islands with airport infrastructure, including a runway.American military officials took a CNN crew along on the Navy reconnaissance flight on Wednesday; a military official said the decision to take a television crew and to release the video footage was deliberate.""It's important that the American public, and the Asian public, too, understands what's going on out there,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about a delicate international issue.A second Defense Department official said discussions were underway on whether the military would increase its naval presence in international waters in the area, including additional patrols using frigates, destroyers and small combat ships. Such a move would most likely further annoy China. Disagreement over the Spratly Islands has continued for several years. The Spratlys are claimed by at least three other countries, including the Philippines, an American ally, and Vietnam, which has sought warmer relations with Washington.Earlier this year, analysts released satellite images of a concrete runway that China was building on Fiery Cross Reef, one of the Spratly Islands. The runway is expected to be about 10,000 feet long. The construction on Fiery Cross Reef is part of a larger Chinese reclamation project involving scores of dredgers on at least five islands. China is converting tiny reefs, once barely visible above water, into islands large enough to handle military hardware, personnel and recreation centers for workers.The Chinese government has maintained that the reclamation efforts are meant to serve civilian purposes like providing a base for search-and-rescue operations. But the Chinese military has also said that the reclamation is for ""necessary military defense.""A senior administration official expressed concern that China was trying to build up the islands as a way to make a case for Chinese sovereignty -- to ""create facts on the ground -- and we can't allow that."" Separately, Daniel R. Russel, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia, told reporters that American military aircraft would continue to exercise the right to operate in international airspace.Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, China has asserted claims in the South China Sea that have increasingly butted against Asian allies of the United States. In particular, the issue of territorial boundaries has come into play.The United States says that foreign aircraft have the right to fly over waters beyond a nation's 12-mile territorial line. China, meanwhile, asserts that foreign aircraft do not have the right to fly within its 200-mile exclusive economic zone without permission.The contentious issue has flared up before. In late 2013, China set off a trans-Pacific uproar when it declared that an ""air defense identification zone"" gave it the right to identify and possibly take military action against aircraft near disputed islands in the East China Sea. Japan, which administers the islands, refused to recognize China's claim, and the United States has since defied China by sending military planes into the zone, unannounced.The islands, known as the Senkaku in Japanese and the Diaoyu in Chinese, are a seven-hour boat ride from Japan, even farther from China. But they, like the Spratlys, have been at the center of ongoing territorial disputes among China and its neighbors.Pentagon officials say they worry that China will try to declare another air defense identification zone over the Spratlys. ""Is this foreshadowing?"" one Defense Department official, who spoke anonymously to discuss a national security matter, said on Friday. ""Well, we can certainly see them trying.""""The Navy flyover was a measured response, meant to signal to the Chinese that the world is watching -- literally -- their provocative reclaiming of land that people don't agree that they own,"" said Andrew L. Oros, an associate professor of political science at Washington College in Chestertown, Md., and a specialist on East Asia. ""This idea that China has, that it can just act unilaterally when other people don't agree, has to be confronted.""To build the artificial island, China has dispatched concrete pylons on cargo vessels from the mainland to build a retaining wall and create the island and a harbor, according to Sean O'Connor, a former United States Air Force intelligence analyst who now works as the principal imagery analyst for IHS Janes, a publication that examines military issues.China has used dozens of dredges that suck up sand and then dump it to make landfill and has constructed concrete manufacturing plants to provide a foundation for runways, he said.Mr. O'Connor said the Chinese seemed to be particularly focused on the runway. ""It looks as though they go over and over it again to make it thick, and can take any kind of plane,"" he said in a telephone interview. In particular, he said, the Chinese would be interested in landing bombers and fighter jets.",1.0
Violence Flares at India-Pakistan Border:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISLAMABAD -- Tensions erupted into violence on Thursday between the estranged, nuclear-armed neighbors Pakistan and India, as both sides made competing claims of violations by security forces along a de facto border in the disputed Kashmir region.Pakistani officials said at least four civilians were killed and several more were wounded after Indian forces opened fire on areas across the contested border. Three civilians were reported killed in two villages near Sialkot, and an 18-year-old woman was killed in Rawalakot, a spokesman for the Pakistani military said. Pakistani Rangers responded to the Indian gunfire, military officials said.Local news outlets broadcast images of residents in border villages near Sialkot holding pieces of mortar shells.On Wednesday, India's paramilitary Border Security Force accused Pakistan of shooting at an Indian border post and of firing mortar shells that landed in a border village, killing one woman and wounding four people, including a soldier at a border post, according to The Associated Press.Both India and Pakistan claim the Kashmir region, an area between northern India and northern Pakistan that has caused decades of tension and sporadic violence between the two nations since the partition at the end of British colonial rule in 1947.Thursday's border clashes come a day after the Pakistani military claimed to have shot down an Indian drone that Pakistan said had violated its airspace on the disputed Kashmir border. The Indian Defense Ministry issued a statement saying that no drone had been shot down.Nonetheless, Pakistan summoned the Indian high commissioner to the foreign office and the foreign secretary ""lodged a strong protest"" over the allegations of airspace violation.The escalation of tensions between the two nations came less than a week after a meeting in Russia between their prime ministers, Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Narendra Modi of India. Both sides had painted the meeting, on July 10, in a positive manner. Pakistan said that Mr. Modi had accepted Mr. Sharif's invitation to visit Pakistan in 2016 during a summit meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, or S.A.A.R.C. Both sides had also announced plans to hold meetings with security officials.Analysts and some politicians here speculated that hawkish elements in the security establishments on either side were opposed to peace.Some analysts pointed out that there had been a consistent pattern of tension between the countries anytime there was a prospect of relations improving.""Whenever there is a development toward peace, such incidents take place,"" said Farhatullah Babar, an opposition senator in Pakistan, during an appearance on a private television news network. ""There are elements on both sides who don't want normalization of ties.""",1.0
"U.S. Increases Airstrikes in Afghanistan on Taliban and Its New Rival, ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- The American military has intensified its airstrikes in Afghanistan in recent weeks, expanding them to include a bombing campaign against Islamic State militants who defeated the Taliban in fighting over a sliver of territory in the eastern part of the country.Throughout June, American drones and warplanes fired against militants in Afghanistan more than twice as much as they had in any previous month this year, according to military statistics.The increase in the use of American air power comes more than six months after President Obama declared that the American combat mission in Afghanistan had ended. The vast majority of the strikes appear to remain focused on Taliban forces, the traditional targets of American airstrikes here for more than a decade. But several have targeted insurgent commanders who defected from the Taliban to swear allegiance to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.American officials have said that the strikes against the Islamic State were part of a defensive policy to protect the coalition forces from harm. But Afghan officials said the strikes against Islamic State targets came partly at the urging of the Afghan domestic intelligence service, which thought it was time to remove them or risk the Islamic State's gaining a foothold in eastern Afghanistan.""We needed to take action,"" said one Afghan official who has been briefed on some of the intelligence that preceded the strikes. ""The willingness on the part of the Americans to provide the air support is always there.""American military officials had played down the Islamic State's activity, but it flared quickly in the eastern Nangarhar Province in the late spring.Since then, American missiles have struck two large-scale gatherings of Islamic State fighters in the province, killing top commanders.""The department anticipated a summer uptick in insurgent activity, and we were prepared to protect our forces,"" said a Pentagon spokeswoman, Henrietta Levin, accounting for the increase in airstrikes. She added, though, that the United States was closely monitoring the growth of the Islamic State in Afghanistan to see if it has a ""meaningful impact.""The pace of airstrikes presents a wild card in the tentative discussions between the Afghan government and the Taliban's leadership over the possibility of peace negotiations.The airstrikes could undermine the Taliban's willingness to negotiate with the Afghan government and could indirectly strengthen the group's legitimacy to an Afghan public that widely loathes the American airstrikes. Or, the airstrikes might give the Afghan government more leverage in negotiations.In a statement released on Wednesday, which was said to come from the Taliban's long-reclusive supreme leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban gave their blessing to exploring peace negotiations ""concurrently with armed jihad.""The Taliban reiterated their demand that foreign troops leave Afghanistan, in particular the country's airspace. Mullah Omar's statement emphasized that jihad remained an obligation because Afghanistan's ""land and airspace are controlled by the invaders.""After years of taking a heavy toll on the insurgency, the recent expansion to target Islamic State forces has become a benefit for the Taliban in parts of Nangarhar. Insurgents with the Taliban and other groups there had lost considerable ground to the upstart cells of Islamic militants. Still, the largest share of the strikes continues to focus on the Taliban, according to interviews and local news reports. Others have targeted Pakistani militants who fled into eastern Afghanistan to escape a Pakistani military offensive.Though the number of strikes in June reached a high point for 2015, it still represented an overall decrease from previous years. The 106 weapons fired this June were less than half the 272 fired in June 2014. In June 2011, the figure was 610 weapons fired.Two senior Afghan officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, suggested that part of the new surge in airstrikes was linked to improved targeting information from the Afghan spy service, the National Directorate of Security. One official said, ""Coordination and intelligence sharing with the Americans has increased in recent months,"" particularly in Nangarhar.In one recent strike, the Afghan intelligence service claimed to have tracked Hafiz Saeed Khan, the Islamic State's chief for Khorasan, an old name for a region that includes Afghanistan and Pakistan, to a recent meeting of militant leaders.""He was trying to escape in a vehicle after the first hit,"" another Afghan official said. ""There were six hits total, and we believe the fifth killed him."" Some social media accounts associated with the Islamic State, however, deny that Mr. Khan is dead.The Islamic State's momentum in Nangarhar has not been replicated elsewhere in Afghanistan, where the organization has been thwarted by the Taliban or is still in the recruitment phase. But in Nangarhar, over the course of at least two dozen skirmishes with the Taliban, the Islamic State emerged as the dominant presence in several districts.In one district, the Islamic State fighters went door to door, having first ""wrapped their faces with scarves,"" and told villagers with ties to the Taliban to leave, Akram Haji, a resident, said. In some areas, the removal applied to almost everyone, since many families have a son or father who has fought for the Taliban or supported them.""They offered us the choice of following their principles and joining the Islamic State or leaving,"" another resident said.Some residents recognized the new fighters as local residents or as men from surrounding districts. Others said the Islamic State's ranks had swelled with Pakistani fighters.The Islamic State imposed a few new rules in areas it controlled, including a ban on naswar, a style of smokeless tobacco. But many residents said the differences between the rival groups were hard to discern.""It's challenging to judge which one is really struggling for Islam,"" said Mohammad Wazir, a farmer from Sherzad District, whose village was seized by Islamic State militants.Mr. Wazir was interviewed in Rodat District, not far from his home, where many families that had lived in territory now held by the Islamic State have resettled.The effect of the airstrikes on the Islamic State's position in Afghanistan remains to be seen.A member of Parliament from Nangarhar, Ismatullah Shinwari, described the drone strikes as ""tremendously effective"" and said that without them, he feared that the Islamic State might have grown strong enough to have ""taken control of the capital of Nangarhar,"" Jalalabad, an important Afghan city.In public statements, as well as in a letter addressed to the Islamic State's self-declared caliph, Abu-Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Taliban have warned the Islamic State to stay out of Afghanistan.In the most recent issue of Dabiq, the Islamic State's online English-language magazine, the group derided Mullah Omar as a minor leader lacking global vision. It said Mullah Omar ""was at most one day a former leader of one of the Islamic lands,"" and possibly dead. Mullah Omar has not been seen in public in years.",1.0
U.S. Strike Is Said to Kill an ISIS Leader in Afghanistan:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- A senior Pakistani militant leading the Afghanistan and Pakistan chapter of the Islamic State was killed in an airstrike by United States forces in eastern Afghanistan on Friday, Afghan officials said on Saturday.The death of the senior militant, Hafiz Saeed Khan, who defected from the Pakistani Taliban last year and was introduced as the head of the Islamic State in the region in January, could not be confirmed independently. Twitter accounts associated with the Islamic State rejected the news, suggesting that it was a false rumor similar to reports of his killing that circulated in April.Twenty-nine other militants were killed in Friday's airstrike, in the Achin District of eastern Nangarhar Province, officials said. It was the second time in a week that United States forces, working on intelligence provided by the Afghan government, targeted Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan.Abdul Hassib Sediqi, a spokesman for Afghanistan's intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, said, ""As a result of an airstrike in Achin district on a gathering place of individuals connected to Daesh, 30 of their members, including their leader, Hafiz Saeed, were killed."" Daesh is the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL.Mr. Sediqi said Mr. Khan's identity was confirmed when his body was identified.A spokesman for the Pentagon confirmed a ""precision strike in Achin,"" but declined to provide further details about the targets of the strike, or to comment on whether any particular militant leaders were killed. At least one Afghan official said the strike that killed Mr. Khan was delivered by a drone.The strike in Afghanistan came on the back of a larger United States air offensive against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the previous 24 hours, according to a military statement, the coalition carried out 34 strikes -- 17 each in Iraq and Syria -- hitting Islamic State buildings, bunkers, vehicles and resupply positions.Afghan officials have long downplayed the threat posed by the Islamic State to Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying it is the same old Taliban fighting under a new name. But comments from officials in recent weeks, and the increase in operations specifically targeting former Taliban fighters who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, suggest that the group is now seen as dangerous to the region's stability.In a meeting with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, on Friday, President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan said the Islamic State was ""a threat for security of the region.""The Afghan intelligence agency has also reported the creation of a special unit to follow Islamic State activities. The agency recently released a five-minute video of what it said was its ""special force for fighting Daesh.""Reports of Mr. Khan's killing in Achin came days after coalition forces targeted a leadership council meeting of the Islamic State in the same district. In that strike, on Monday, Mr. Khan's deputy, Gul Zaman, and one of his senior commanders, Shahidullah Shahid -- formerly the main spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban -- were killed. The total toll from the strike was unclear, with Afghan reports ranging from 24 to 45 deaths.Many of the Pakistani militants fled to eastern Afghanistan after the Pakistani military launched an offensive in its tribal areas last year. Some parts of the east, particularly in Nangarhar Province, have turned into battle zones between the Afghan Taliban and militants who have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.Also on Saturday, a blast in southern Kandahar Province killed three children and wounded six others, officials said. Samim Khaplwak, the spokesman for the provincial governor, said explosives had been placed in a pillow near a religious school on the outskirts of the city of Kandahar.""We do not know if the targets were the children,"" Mr. Khaplwak said.",1.0
Drone Strike Kills 2 Pak istanis Tied to ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ],,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- Two senior Pakistani militants who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State were among at least 24 people killed in an American drone strike in eastern Afghanistan on Monday, Pakistani and Afghan security officials said Thursday.Afghan officials described one of the men, Gul Zaman, as the deputy leader of the Islamic State in Afghanistan. The other commander, Shahidullah Shahid, had been the main spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban until he joined Islamic State last year.Though officials do not yet consider the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, to be a major threat in either Pakistan or Afghanistan, the group has drawn increased support from disaffected Taliban militants on both sides of the border over the past year.A senior Pakistani official in Peshawar said both men had been killed alongside several other militants in an American drone strike in Nangarhar Province, in eastern Afghanistan, on Monday. The official said the drone strike had targeted a leadership council meeting of the so-called Islamic State in Khorasan, an old term that includes Pakistan and Afghanistan.A spokesman for the Afghan intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, confirmed the deaths in a public statement. The total toll from the strike was unclear, with Afghan reports ranging from 24 to 45 deaths.Mr. Shahid announced his allegiance to the Islamic State after the Pakistani military began an offensive last year in the North Waziristan tribal region, which had long been a safe haven for the militants in northwestern Pakistan.That offensive, and a parallel operation in the Tirah Valley in Khyber tribal agency, forced many militants to flee across the border into Afghanistan.Gul Zaman, also known as Mullah Fateh, had been second-in-command to the regional head of Islamic State, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed. It was not clear whether Mr. Saeed was present at the meeting, the Pakistani official said.""It was a pretty massive hit,"" said the Pakistani official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity and said he was citing sources inside Afghanistan. ""So many I.S. fighters and commanders have been killed in one go.""The official said that Pakistani Taliban fighters based inside Afghanistan had retrieved the bodies from the wreckage of the targeted building. Officials say that the Islamic State and the Pakistani Taliban have been engaged in a violent turf battle in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan.",1.0
World Briefing | Africa; Mali: French Troops Kill a Top Militant:   [Foreign Desk ],,"On Nov. 2, 2013, two French journalists were grabbed in the troubled northern Malian town of Kidal. Hours later, their bodies were found on a dirt track, lying near their kidnapper's car, which had a broken steering wheel.Investigators later determined that the journalists had been abducted by gunmen loyal to Al Qaeda's regional branch, a group that has financed itself by kidnapping Europeans for ransom.But this time, when the car broke down, the gunmen called their commander, who allegedly ordered that the journalists -- Ghislaine Dupont, 57, Radio France Internationale's senior correspondent, and her sound technician, Claude Verlon, 55 -- be killed, according to a senior Malian intelligence official.On Wednesday, France's Ministry of Defense confirmed that French troops had killed the man believed to have been that commander: Abdelkarim al-Targui, of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.""In the night of May 17 to 18, French special forces carried out an operation in northern Mali. Four terrorists were killed during the ensuing combat. Among them was Amada Ag Hama, who used the alias 'Abdelkarim the Tuareg,' "" the ministry's statement said, using an alternative spelling of Targui.The journalists' killings shocked France as severely as the journalist James Foley's beheading last summer shocked the American public, so Mr. Targui's death is symbolic for France, one of the most prolific payers of ransoms to Al Qaeda.For years, a crisis unit in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris tried to negotiate the release of at least three other French citizens held by Mr. Targui's platoon, or by brigades to which he was subordinate in northern Mali.He proved to be one of the most intransigent of Al Qaeda's regional leaders, most of whom approached kidnapping strictly as a business, making sure to take good care of hostages in order to trade them for suitcases of cash.By contrast, two of the three French citizens known to have been held by Mr. Targui's brigade were killed -- one in retaliation for a French-led airstrike and the other for trying to escape -- suggesting a harder hand than most of his terrorist colleagues in the Sahara.In addition to Ms. Dupont and Mr. Verlon, Mr. Targui's unit was involved in the kidnapping of Serge Lazarevic and Philippe Verdon, French citizens who had traveled to Mali to do a feasibility study for a new mine. They were grabbed from their hotel rooms in late 2011. According to a senior negotiator, who requested anonymity to speak on a delicate subject, Mr. Verdon was killed by Mr. Targui's men in 2013 after trying to use a mirror to signal to a French aircraft overhead.Mr. Lazarevic was freed last Dec. 9 after the release of several Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb prisoners in Mali, according to a statement by Mali's justice minister. Experts tracking the terrorist group suspect that France paid a ransom, but the amount remains unknown.Another hostage, Michel Germaneau, 78, a French engineer, was kidnapped in Niger in 2010 and killed three months later in revenge for a French military raid on the group. Mr. Germaneau was under the control of a different commander, Abou Zeid, but reports have emerged that Mr. Targui was among the foot soldiers assigned to watch over the hostage, and some negotiators believe Mr. Germaneau was killed by Mr. Targui.""He was a big fish,"" said an elected official from Kidal, who requested anonymity to discuss an intelligence matter. ""He was at the foundation of everything. It's he who took Lazarevic, and Verdon and Germaneau. It was always him in the background. This is a big strike against the group. They are paying a big price.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
Kiev Claims to Capture 2 Soldiers of Russia:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- The Ukrainian government said on Monday that it had captured two wounded Russian soldiers in eastern Ukraine and would prosecute them on terrorism charges, prompting a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin to repeat the Kremlin's longstanding denial that any Russian troops had been deployed across the border.The soldiers were identified by Gen. Viktor Muzhenko, the chief of the general staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as Capt. Yevgeny Yerofeyev and Sgt. Aleksandr Aleksandrov of the Third Special Forces Brigade, which is based in Togliatti, a city in southern Russia.Russia's denials that its active duty soldiers have been fighting in eastern Ukraine have continued despite substantial evidence to the contrary, including the funerals of young Russian soldiers killed in action. The Kremlin has acknowledged that some Russians have participated in the fighting, but says that they are volunteers who often choose to fight during their vacations.""Despite allegations and despite official statements of the Russian Federation about the absence of the Russian troops in eastern Ukraine, we are ready to present evidence of the opposite,"" General Muzhenko said in a televised news conference in Kiev, the capital. ""We know their names, their military ranks, as well as their military stations.""General Muzhenko and other Ukrainian military officials said the Russians had been captured after a clash between their unit and Ukrainian forces near the city of Shchastya, about 15 miles north of the regional capital of Luhansk, which is a stronghold of pro-Russian separatists.Viktor Nikolyuk, the commander of Ukrainian forces involved in the fight, said one of his soldiers had been killed and another wounded. He said that the two captives were from a reconnaissance unit that included 14 other Russian soldiers, and that they had been provided with medical treatment immediately after being taken prisoner.In a video posted to YouTube by Anton Gerashchenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, Sergeant Aleksandrov identifies himself as a member of the Russian special forces unit and Captain Yerofeyev as his commander. He said he had been serving in eastern Ukraine since May 6.Victoria J. Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, who was visiting Moscow on Monday for meetings with Russian officials about efforts to fulfill a cease-fire agreement in Ukraine, said she had received assurances from the Ukrainian government that the two captives were being treated well.Ukrainian officials said they would be prosecuted on terrorism charges and face sentences of up to life in prison.At a news conference on Monday, Mr. Putin's spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, initially said the questions about the two captured soldiers should be directed at the Defense Ministry, not the Putin administration.""Of course, I cannot confirm it, because we are not whom the question should be addressed to,"" Mr. Peskov said, when asked if the two men were indeed Russian military personnel. ""We and the Defense Ministry on many occasions have said that there were not any Russian military in Donbas,"" he said, referring to the embattled Donets River basin.He suggested that ""specialists"" in the Defense Ministry were better positioned to answer. When a reporter noted that Mr. Putin was also commander in chief of the Russian military, Mr. Peskov replied: ""I understand, but anyway in this case, it is not us who the question should be addressed to. I repeat one more time: The main thing, actually the basis of what can be answered, is that there were and there are no military men there.""Russia's military intervention in Ukraine, beginning with the annexation of Crimea, and continuing in the east with supplies of fighters, weapons and training for separatist forces, has brought relations between Russia and the West to one of their lowest points since the Cold War, and prompted the United States and its allies to impose economic sanctions against a number of Mr. Putin's closest confidantes.A cease-fire agreement reached in February has substantially reduced the fighting, but there are constant violations. Kiev has complained repeatedly that the border with Russia remains open, and that Russia continues to supply weapons and training to the separatist forces.",1.0
Saudi-Led Airstrikes Resume in Yemen as Truce Ends:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- A military coalition led by Saudi Arabia resumed airstrikes in Yemen on Sunday, hours after the expiration of a five-day humanitarian cease-fire between the coalition and Houthi rebels.Residents in the southern city of Aden reported warplanes flying overhead late Sunday and the sound of airstrikes falling on what appeared to be Houthi-controlled neighborhoods in the city.There had been no official statement from Saudi Arabia about whether it intended to renew the truce when it lapsed at 11 p.m. on Sunday. International aid agencies, as well as the United Nations envoy to Yemen, had called for an extension in order to continue delivering relief supplies to Yemen, which has been under an air and sea blockade since the Saudi-led coalition began its offensive against the Houthis in late March.The escalation of the fighting on Sunday appeared to threaten a frenzied relief effort that had sought to take advantage of the break in the fighting. On Sunday, aid workers acknowledged that those efforts so far had been insufficient, given the scale of the crisis in Yemen, a deeply poor country that relies almost entirely on imports for basic goods.Emergency supplies, delivered by chartered planes and rickety wooden dhows during the truce, reached only a small fraction of those in need, relief workers said.Unicef said it had been able to resupply health care centers, activate mobile medical teams in rural areas affected by the fighting and supply fuel that allowed local authorities to run water systems. The group also delivered solar-powered refrigerators to keep vaccines cold in a country starved of electricity.""It's nowhere near enough,"" said Julien Harneis, Unicef's Yemen representative. ""A country of 26 million people was essentially cut off from any commercial shipping as a result of the way the arms embargo is being implemented,"" he said, referring to the Saudi-led blockade.Ships that were able to dock during the truce provided a ""minute percentage of the amount of goods that need to come into the country for any normal life,"" Mr. Harneis said.André Heller Pérache, of Doctors Without Borders in Yemen, said the devastating shortage of fuel had hardly eased during the cease-fire.""Hospitals are still scrambling to find fuel for generators,"" he said. Without fuel for cars, people struggled to reach hospitals. ""The capital city is dark at night.""Saudi Arabia proposed the cease-fire this month as it faced growing criticism of its military campaign against the Houthis, a rebel group from northern Yemen that had taken control of the capital and other parts of the country and forced the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile.Hundreds of airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition of Arab states failed to stop advances by the Houthis in Aden and the city of Taiz. The combination of the bombing campaign and a brutal offensive by pro-Houthi forces has killed more than 1,400, most of them civilians.The cease-fire halted airstrikes on Sana after weeks of bombing, but fighting continued in Taiz and elsewhere. It remained unclear whether the airstrikes on Sunday signaled a full-scale resumption of the war or were a deft attempt by the Saudis to restore a military advantage, and could be followed by another truce.Speaking on Sunday at a conference on the Yemen crisis in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a special envoy from the United Nations read a statement from Secretary General Ban Ki-moon that called for all parties to come together to resolve the conflict and urged an extension of the cease-fire.The conference, convened by Saudi Arabia, consisted of only one side in the domestic conflict, bringing together Yemeni factions and regional organizations that support the effort to restore Mr. Hadi to power. It excluded any representatives of the Houthi movement or their allies among the backers of Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's former president.""The humanitarian truce should turn into a permanent cease-fire,"" the envoy, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, said, reading the statement. There was ""no solution to the crisis but comprehensive dialogue that will not exclude anyone.""",1.0
"Border Clash With Iraqis Kills Seven, Saudis Say:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Four heavily armed men from Iraq attacked a Saudi border patrol early Monday, firing automatic weapons and detonating suicide belts in a confrontation that left three guards and all the assailants dead, Saudi officials said.The early morning clash, which the Saudis described as an attempted infiltration near an isolated patch of the Saudi-Iraqi frontier, was one of the deadliest episodes of border violence for Saudi Arabia.It was likely to raise fears of jihadist infiltrations in the kingdom from Iraq and Yemen -- another radical Islamist breeding ground that shares a border with Saudi Arabia, which controls access to Islam's holiest sites.Saudi officials said the border guards had suspected the men were trying to sneak across the border. When confronted, the men fired automatic weapons and detonated suicide belts to avoid arrest, the officials said.It was unclear whether the assailants were affiliated with any organization. No group has claimed responsibility. A spokesman for Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry, Maj. Gen. Mansour Turki, said by phone that the Saudi authorities were working to learn more about the attackers.""Two of them blew themselves up and two of them were killed in clashes, so we have to work on establishing their identities,"" General Turki said.Al Qaeda has attacked the kingdom in the past. The Islamic State has threatened attacks as retribution for Saudi participation in an American-led bombing campaign against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.Both General Turki and a report on the state-run Saudi Press Agency described the clash as a result of a confrontation, not an armed assault on a border post.Monitoring the frontier with surveillance technology, the border guards had gone to investigate four men seen near the border, General Turki said.As the guards approached, thinking the men could be smugglers, the men opened fire. The guards fired back, killing one of the men. In the ensuing battle, another man was shot dead by border guards and the other two blew themselves up.Three border guards were also killed.The men had been carrying weapons that included a machine gun and hand grenades and some cash.General Turki said he could not remember the last time an armed clash had occurred on its border with Iraq, although he said some positions had been targeted by mortar fire from the Iraqi side.Hassan Abu Hanieh, a Jordanian expert on Islamist groups, said he doubted that the Islamic State had sent the men because of the small scale of the operation.""I don't think that ISIS would launch a small, failed operation like this given all of its capabilities,"" he said. ""That doesn't seem like their way.""Mr. Abu Hanieh said the assailants more likely had been associated with Al Qaeda, which has tried many times to sneak into Saudi Arabia from Yemen, its southern neighbor.",1.0
Ukraine: U.N. Details Fighting's Toll as U.S. and Russian Officials Meet:   [Foreign Desk ],,"GENEVA -- The United Nations said on Monday that a sharp escalation in recent fighting in eastern Ukraine had left more than 800 people dead and over 3,400 wounded, with hundreds missing and many buried without their deaths being recorded.Ivan Simonovic, the United Nations assistant secretary general, told reporters here that more than 6,000 people had been killed since the fighting started in April -- at least 842 of whom died from mid-January to the middle of last month.The casualty figures were included in a United Nations report issued on Monday that also said an influx of troops and heavy weapons from Russia had intensified the conflict in Ukraine.""Credible reports indicate a continuing influx of heavy and sophisticated weaponry to armed groups in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as foreign fighters, including from the Russian Federation,"" the United Nations report said.""This has fueled the escalation of the conflict and new offensives by armed groups, undermining the potential for peace as armed groups extend their areas of control,"" the report said. ""This has resulted in further and significant increases in civilian and military casualties.""The report was issued as Secretary of State John Kerry met with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, in Switzerland to discuss the crisis in Ukraine.Mr. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said in a speech to the Human Rights Council here in Geneva that the cease-fire in Ukraine was being ""consolidated"" and that any decision by Western nations to send arms to Ukraine would ""disrupt the peace.""The Obama administration has been considering whether to send arms to Ukraine to deter Russian-backed separatists and Russian troops from further advances, though the White House appears to have put off a decision in recent weeks.Mr. Kerry said that to avoid further sanctions, Russia must arrange for the separatists to relax their grip on the strategically important town of Debaltseve, which they seized soon after a cease-fire reached last month in Minsk, Belarus, went into effect.""There has been a kind of cherry picking"" by the Russians about what elements of the cease-fire to honor, Mr. Kerry told reporters at a news conference on Monday. ""There is not yet a full cease-fire.""Mr. Kerry said that he had raised his concerns about the seizing of Debaltseve and the presence of Russian-backed separatists near the port city of Mariupol during his morning meeting here with Mr. Lavrov.A rocket attack on Mariupol at the end of January killed 31 people, according to Mr. Simonovic, citing an example from the United Nations report of the growing use of heavy weapons by all sides and indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas.The report also drew attention to the plight of civilians in areas of conflict, saying that attempted evacuations in government-controlled areas had apparently been targeted by shelling. But travel restrictions imposed by the government in Kiev had also made it harder for civilians to escape conflict areas, the United Nations said.More than 400 civilians continue to be held prisoner by pro-Russian armed groups, the United Nations monitors reported, noting that an ""all for all"" prisoner exchange included in the cease-fire agreement signed last month had not been fully enacted.

World Briefing | Asia; China: Pentagon Says Naval Ships Entered U.S. Waters Off Alaska:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Five Chinese Navy ships that sailed this week off the coast of Alaska entered United States territorial waters, but they have since left the area, Pentagon officials said on Friday.Capt. Jeff Davis, a Defense Department spokesman, said that at one point the ships had come within 12 nautical miles of the United States, which put them inside American territorial waters. But Captain Davis said that it was a ""legal transit"" of the ships in the Bering Sea and that the Chinese had complied with international law.Defense officials said that this was the first time that the American military had noted such activity by China. The ships' arrival in the area came as President Obama was touring Alaska.The Chinese venture into waters off the Alaskan coast occurred as China has increasingly been flexing its military muscle, particularly in waters off the coast of China. Beijing has increased military spending and now has an aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.Last year, Chinese officials took Chuck Hagel, the defense secretary at the time, on a tour of the carrier, and many American officials interpreted the move as an effort to project Chinese naval power, particularly in light of tensions between Beijing and its neighbors over disputed islands in the East and South China Seas.But Beijing announced this week that it was cutting its military by 300,000 people, a move that American officials said was meant to project China's peaceful intentions -- but also a signal that President Xi Jinping intends to reorganize and modernize the Chinese military.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
45 Soldiers From U.A.E. Are Killed in Yemen:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- The United Arab Emirates said on Friday that 45 of its soldiers were killed fighting Houthi insurgents in a province east of Yemen's capital, in a major setback for the coalition of Arab forces that have been trying for months to vanquish the rebels.The death toll was the largest in a single day for the military of the United Arab Emirates, the Persian Gulf nation that has assumed a central role in the Saudi-led coalition seeking to restore Yemen's exiled government to power.A statement carried by a Houthi-run news agency said that the deaths came after the rebels fired what it called a ballistic missile at a military base used by the coalition in Marib Province, striking an arms depot and destroying other equipment, including Apache helicopters.Bahrain, another member of the Saudi coalition, said on Friday that five of its soldiers also had been killed.The casualties undercut recent battlefield gains by the Saudi-backed forces as well as confident assertions by Yemeni government officials that the coalition was poised to rout the Houthis from their stronghold in the capital, Sana.With more than 4,000 people killed, Yemen has hosted one of the region's bloodiest conflicts since the coalition began bombing the Houthis and their allies nearly six months ago.The casualties reported Friday came at time when diplomats had been hoping to move the antagonists closer to a cease-fire. In a sign of how the conflict could quickly escalate, warplanes of the Saudi-led forces carried out some of the most intense airstrikes on the capital in weeks on Friday. They bombed military targets on the outskirts but also targeted the Defense Ministry, near Sana's historic old city, a Unesco World Heritage site, sending residents of nearby buildings fleeing the area.The Emirates state news agency said the country's fighters had carried out ""destructive airstrikes"" against ""strongholds of the rebellious militias.""The Saudi-led coalition began bombing Yemen in March after the Houthis, a northern rebel group, drove the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi from power and into exile. After months of a stalemated battle, Emirati soldiers played a critical role in shifting the war in favor of the coalition, including by helping anti-Houthi forces recapture Aden, a port city in Yemen's south.The forceful military intervention by the United Arab Emirates, which has committed thousands of troops, was part of a united effort by the Sunni Persian Gulf monarchies to counter what they viewed as Iran's backing of the Shiite-led Houthis. While Friday's high death toll was unprecedented for the Gulf states fighting in the coalition, dozens of allied Yemeni anti-Houthi fighters have been killed in ""friendly fire"" attacks by coalition warplanes.The Houthis have long denied receiving significant support from Iran and said in their statement on Friday that the attack on the base was ""a legitimate response by the army and popular committees to the crimes and genocide committed by the Saudi aggression and its mercenaries.""",1.0
"Warplanes Hit Wedding in Yemen, Reports Say:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SANA, Yemen -- Warplanes with the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition bombed a wedding party on Yemen's Red Sea coast on Monday, killing at least 70 civilians, according to two local officials and a relative of one of the victims.The aerial attack, in Wahija, south of the port city of Mokha, appeared to be among the deadliest involving civilians since the start of Yemen's war this past March. The death toll was difficult to confirm, in part because the bodies of the victims were badly mangled, witnesses said.The killings added to criticism of the Saudi-led coalition for carrying out what human rights advocates and aid workers said was a military campaign that increasingly failed to distinguish between military targets and civilians. The coalition's stated goal has been to beat back the Houthis, a rebel group from the north that has seized control of Sana, the capital, and other territory that has forced the government into exile.A coalition spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, told Reuters on Monday that the reports of the killings at the wedding were ""false news"" and that there had been no coalition air operations in the area for the last three days. Efforts to reach General Assiri for further comment were unsuccessful.Thousands of civilians have died as most of western Yemen has been swept up in war, and the majority of those deaths have come in airstrikes. In almost every case, the Saudi coalition has either denied responsibility for the killings or blamed Houthi militants. Saudi Arabia has also sought to head off a mission to Yemen by human rights investigators with the United Nations who would look into violations by all the warring parties.The Obama administration, which has supported the Saudi war effort by providing intelligence and logistical support, has avoided any direct public rebuke of the Saudis, while calling on coalition planners to investigate reports of civilian casualties.The attack on Monday morning was at least the third time in the last 10 days that the coalition had been blamed for killing large numbers of civilians. Since Sept. 20, bombings in Sana have killed at least 28 people, including 11 members of one family. On Sunday, helicopters flying from Saudi Arabia killed at least 30 people in a village near the Yemen border, local residents and medical personnel told Reuters.In a sign that the pace of the deaths was becoming harder to ignore, Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, issued an unusually sharp public criticism of the Saudi-led coalition in an address to the General Assembly in New York on Monday.""All sides are showing disregard for human life -- but most of the casualties are being caused by airstrikes,"" he said, according to a transcript of his remarks. ""I call for an end to the bombings, which are also destroying Yemeni cities, infrastructure and heritage,"" he added.Ahmed Altabozi, who said a niece, Fatma Al-Khaishani, had been killed in the bombing of the wedding party, called the attack inexplicable. The wedding tents were in a remote stretch of the desert, far from any ""military sites, soldiers or the presence of the state."" The majority of villagers had already left the area, fearing the airstrikes, he said.Mr. Altabozi said that he heard the bombs from his house, which is less than a mile away, about 11 a.m. Two initial airstrikes hit one tent, and other bombs, minutes later, fell on a second tent where a group of women had taken shelter, causing most of the casualties, he said.""I saw no body intact,"" he added.A local council official had said early Monday that the groom, Mirsal Buseibis, had been killed, but Mr. Altabozi said Mr. Buseibis had survived.",1.0
Saudi Officials Deny Killing Yemeni Civilians:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANAA, Yemen -- Attack helicopters flying from Saudi Arabia killed 30 civilians in a Yemeni village on Sunday, according to accounts by residents and local medical officials. But the Saudi authorities dismissed the accounts as ""totally false.""Apache helicopters fired rockets at the village of Bani Zela in Hajjah Province, roughly seven miles from the Saudi border, killing at least 25 civilians, including women and children, the residents and medics said. Helicopters then returned for a second strike as residents and medical teams were trying to evacuate casualties, killing three medics and two more civilians, they said.""People were fleeing their homes as the helicopters pursued,"" said a resident who identified himself as Khaled. ""They committed a massacre for no reason.""Yemen's Saba news agency, run by the Houthi group now in control of much of the country, put the death toll at 28 and said 17 others were injured. A Saudi official said that the military coalition of Arab states it is leading in Yemen had played no role in any attack in the area. ""This is totally false news. We deny it,"" said the official, who declined to be identified, adding that no coalition helicopters operated so far from the border.The Saudi-led campaign over the past six months has resulted in several mass killings of civilians, including 36 people at a water bottling plant in August.",1.0
France Says Its Airstrikes Hit an ISIS Camp in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"PARIS -- In France's first airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Syria, warplanes destroyed a training camp, President François Hollande announced on Sunday.At a news conference in New York, where he had arrived for the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Hollande said that the warplanes had attacked the training camp in eastern Syria after it had been identified by French air surveillance with help from the coalition of Western and Middle Eastern states conducting the air campaign against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.""Our forces reached their objectives: The camp was completely destroyed,"" Mr. Hollande said. ""Six jets were used, including five Rafales, and they were able to ensure that our operation did not have any consequences for the civilian population.""He added that France might launch other strikes in the coming weeks if necessary, with the goal of ""identifying targets that are training camps or places where we know that the Daesh terrorist group can threaten the security of our country.""Prime Minister Manuel Valls also confirmed to reporters in southeastern France that the airstrikes had taken place.""We are striking Daesh in Syria because this terrorist organization prepares and organizes attacks in France from Syria, from these sanctuaries,"" Mr. Valls said. ""We are therefore acting in self-defense, which Article 51 of the United Nations Charter permits us to do.""Mr. Hollande's announcement did not come as a surprise. He said this month that France would start air surveillance missions over Syria, and a week later, his defense minister confirmed that France was gathering intelligence to conduct airstrikes on Islamic State targets there.France was already involved in the air campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq, but it had been reluctant to hit the group in Syria out of fear of indirectly helping the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.The French government has shifted its position in the face of fears that the Islamic State is recruiting disaffected youths in France and sending or coordinating with European fighters back home to stage attacks. The flow of Syrian refugees arriving in Europe has also apparently pushed the French government to be more active in the conflict.In a statement released by his office on Sunday, Mr. Hollande said a ""global response"" to the chaos in Syria was required.""Civilian populations must be protected against all forms of violence, that of Daesh and other terrorist groups, but also against the deadly bombings by Bashar al-Assad,"" he said.France has repeatedly said that Mr. Assad's departure is necessary for a political solution to the Syrian crisis.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

Pentagon Says Chinese Pilot Flew Too Close to Spy Plane:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- A Chinese fighter jet performed an unsafe maneuver last week while close to a United States spy plane, Defense Department officials said Wednesday. It is the second time in just over a year that the Pentagon has accused Chinese pilots of inflaming tensions.Military officials said the latest episode occurred Sept. 15 about 80 miles east of the Shandong Peninsula in the Yellow Sea. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Chinese fighter jet passed in front of an American RC-135 reconnaissance plane in an unsafe way.Pentagon officials said the planes did not come close to colliding. But the Defense Department is reviewing the episode and may issue a démarche, or diplomatic complaint, to the Chinese authorities, as it did last year after a similar episode, officials said.News of the episode came during a visit by President Xi Jinping of China to the United States, amid rising tensions between the two countries, particularly over Chinese actions involving disputed islands in the East and South China Seas.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said that he did not know about the episode but that China was committed to maritime and aviation security. China is dedicated ""to establishing mutual military trust with other countries to appropriately manage differences,"" he told reporters, according to Reuters.In August 2014, there was a similar, if more theatrical, episode in which a Chinese fighter jet flew within 30 feet of a Navy surveillance and reconnaissance plane in international airspace just off the Chinese coast.The episode began when the Chinese warplane flew close underneath a Navy P-8 Poseidon. It then moved parallel to the naval plane, with the wingtips of the two aircraft separated by less than 30 feet.As a final maneuver, the Chinese fighter jet executed a barrel roll, apparently to show off its weapons payload to the American pilot. A barrel roll is when a fighter jet rolls over and then levels out.Military officials take such intercepts seriously, particularly given that a Chinese fighter jet collided with a United States Navy spy plane in April 2001 in the skies above Hainan Island. The Chinese pilot was killed, and the American plane was forced to make an emergency landing on Hainan.After the collision, the Chinese authorities detained the American crew for over a week and issued an angry initial statement saying that ""the U.S. side has total responsibility for this event.""Adm. Dennis C. Blair, the commander in chief of the United States Pacific Command at the time, issued his own angry statement, saying that the Chinese plane had been tailing the American jet, a practice that Beijing's military had increasingly adopted.China has continued to show off its military prowess to the United States in the years since the Hainan episode. This month, five Chinese Navy ships entered United States territorial waters off Alaska, Defense Department officials said. That move came as President Obama was touring Alaska.Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.",1.0
At Least 13 Reported Dead in Yemen Strikes:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MUKALLA, Yemen -- Airstrikes by a Saudi-led military coalition killed at least 13 civilians working early Sunday at a water plant in northern Yemen, the plant's owner said.The bombings appeared to be the latest in a series of airstrikes by Saudi Arabia or its Arab coalition partners that have hit civilian facilities with no apparent military target nearby. Houthi rebels, who have been the main target of Saudi Arabia's five-month military campaign in Yemen, were not in the immediate area at the time, according to Ibrahim al-Razoom, the owner of the plant.The airstrikes transformed the factory in Hajja Province, in the north, into ""ruins"" and wounded at least 11 other people, he said.The Saudi-led coalition rarely acknowledges whether its airstrikes have hit civilian targets. A coalition spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asseri, told the Reuters news agency on Sunday that the plant had been used by the Houthis to make explosive devices and was not, in fact, a bottling factory.The coalition has recently intensified its bombing of Hajja and other parts of Yemen bordering Saudi Arabia in response to more aggressive cross-border attacks by the Houthis. The airstrikes -- including an intense barrage late Saturday and early Sunday in the city of Abs, in Hajja Province -- are part of a broader escalation of fighting across the country that has prompted dire warnings from aid groups.The charity group Save the Children issued a statement on Sunday warning that one of the main pediatric hospitals in the capital, Sana, faced imminent closure because of fuel shortages and a lack of medical supplies caused by fighting and the ""de facto"" blockade of Yemen by the Saudi-led coalition. The hospital, called Al-Sabeen, serves roughly three million people, the group said.Hospital staff members told Save the Children that Al-Sabeen had run out of critical supplies, including anesthetics, blood transfusion tests and food for severely malnourished children, and that it had enough fuel to run generators for only two days.""Should they be forced to close, hundreds of children currently admitted will stop receiving treatment,"" the group said.",1.0
Turkey Launches Its First Airstrikes of ISIS Campaign:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Turkey has launched its first wave of airstrikes as part of the United States-led coalition to fight the Islamic State, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement Saturday.Turkish fighter jets carried out joint operations against Islamic State targets in Syria late Friday, which posed a threat to Turkey's national security, the statement said.Islamic State militants gained control of five villages in northern Syria on Thursday and advanced toward the Turkish border, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group.The attack comes weeks after Turkey took a major tactical shift by assuming a more active role in the campaign against the Islamic militant group, plunging into direct cross-border confrontations and allowing American warplanes to use its air bases.Until now, Turkey, a NATO member and longtime ally of the United States, had been unwilling to take a direct stance against the group, mainly out of concern over retaliation.Since shifting gears, however, Turkey has come under criticism for lagging in its engagement and prioritizing its renewed military operations against a Kurdish insurgency group in Turkey and Northern Iraq, a group that has nonetheless been one of the most effective in fighting the Islamic State on the ground.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter of the United States called on Ankara last week to participate fully in the American-led campaign against the group and increase security measures across its border with Syria.Mr. Carter said Turkey needed to join in the airstrike campaign, adding, ""They need to work more on controlling their border. And we've made that clear.""Turkish officials have rejected accusations that they have been reluctant to join international efforts to fight the Islamic State, and insist the delay is because of lengthy discussions on logistics and technical operations.Those talks were concluded last week, according to the Foreign Ministry, which said Ankara would coordinate with coalition nations on airstrikes.""The fight against the terrorist organization is a priority for Turkey,"" the statement said.",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; Pakistan: Civilians Killed as Troops Trade Fire With India in Kashmir:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan and India on Friday accused each other of targeting civilians in the latest deadly exchange of cross-border fire, as relations continued to worsen just days after talks between top security officials of both countries were canceled.Pakistan's military said that at least eight civilians had been killed and at least 47 wounded by Indian fire in the eastern Sialkot region of Pakistan. In response, the country's Army chief visited the border area and accused India of ""terrorizing the civilian population,"" according to a spokesman.At the same time, Indian officials said that at least three civilians had been killed by Pakistani fire across the border. Neither country reported any military casualties in the fighting.Relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbors have plummeted recently as each side accused the other of border violations and instigating terrorism.India has long accused Pakistan of supporting separatist militants in the disputed Kashmir region, and Pakistan has leveled allegations that India is aiding separatist rebels in Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan Province.Last week, talks between the national security advisers of both countries, scheduled to be held in New Delhi, were canceled after sharp disagreements emerged over Pakistani plans to meet with Kashmiri leaders in New Delhi. India said the Kashmiri meeting was not acceptable, and Pakistani officials responded by pulling out of the security talks.""It has been apparent that neither the Modi government nor the Pakistan military are particularly keen on stabilizing the bilateral relationship,"" said Cyril Almeida, an editor at the Pakistani news publication Dawn, referring to the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi.The Sialkot region has been particularly volatile for the past year; troops from both sides have repeatedly traded fire there.

Iran's Navy Blasts Away at a Mock U.S. Carrier:   [Foreign Desk ],,"TEHRAN -- Iran's navy may pale in comparison to that of the United States, but on Wednesday it inflicted serious damage on an American aircraft carrier -- a mock-up of one, to be exact.The replica, which seemed to have been built on top of a barge, took some nasty hits, just as a real carrier would in a real war situation, Iranian commanders boasted.""A unique power has been created, and we do not like to put it into practice,"" Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the highest commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, told the local news media. ""But if, God forbid, such a day comes, Iran's navy will have the complete control over the Sea of Oman, the Hormuz Strait and the Persian Gulf.""The simulation, called Great Prophet 9, was the centerpiece of an exercise by the naval branch of the Revolutionary Guards, and it was carried out in the vicinity of the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic waterway through which more than 20 percent of the world's oil passes.State television showed images of missiles striking a ""ship"" resembling a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, similar to the ones permanently patrolling the blue waters of the Persian Gulf. Enveloped in smoke, the ersatz warship was swarmed by dozens of Iranian speedboats, as a presenter described the types of missiles, torpedoes and rockets blowing holes in its sides.Military officials could be heard shouting ""praise the lord"" each time the replica was hit.""That is the Fateh-110 missile hitting its target,"" the presenter said, as more smoke belched from the fake aircraft carrier. ""God will guide those who fight in line with his wishes,"" he added, quoting a line from the Quran.Though Iran and the United States are engaged in nuclear talks, Iran has often threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation for any attack on its nuclear sites.Wednesday's make-believe attack is part of Iran's strategy to show military might, despite being engaged in direct talks with its archenemy, the United States.The United States' presence in the Persian Gulf has long vexed Iran's leaders, who have said there is no reason for the American Navy to project power so far from its borders. In addition, Iranian officers say, its very presence presents a danger to the region.""American aircraft carriers are very big ammunition depots housing a lot of missiles, rockets, torpedoes and everything else,"" the Revolutionary Guards' navy chief, Adm. Ali Fadavi, said on state television, adding that a direct hit by a missile could set off a large secondary explosion. Last month, Admiral Fadavi said his force was capable of sinking American aircraft carriers in the event of war.The mock carrier bore a striking resemblance to a model that the United States military noticed when it was under construction in a shipyard in the port of Bandar Abbas last year. It quickly became known as the Target Barge. The United States did not seem overly concerned about the exercise or the implied threat to its carriers.""We are aware of a recent exercise by Iranian naval forces involving a mock-up of a vessel similar to an aircraft carrier,"" said Cmdr. Elissa Smith, a Defense Department spokeswoman. ""We are confident in our naval forces' ability to defend themselves against any maritime threat.""Cmdr. Kevin Stephens, the spokesman for the Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, echoed that confidence, adding in remarks to The Associated Press, ""It seems they've attempted to destroy the equivalent of a Hollywood movie set.""",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; China: Airstrip Being Built on Reef:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIJING -- New satellite images show that China has started construction of an airstrip on a third artificial island in the South China Sea that will strengthen Beijing's military capacity in the contested waters, Western analysts say.The photographs, released by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, show preparation for airfields on Mischief Reef and Subi Reef, submerged reefs in the contested Spratly Islands that China has transformed into islands, according to the center.The airstrip on Mischief Reef is about 20 miles from a small Philippine military garrison on an existing tiny island and will put the installation under great pressure, said James Hardy, Asia-Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defense Weekly.That airstrip will most likely be used for turboprop patrol, but it could easily be equipped for ""full military action"" if needed, Mr. Hardy said. The most important function of the strip, he said, will be as yet another site for Chinese listening devices and early warning radar, much like the technology being installed on Woody Island in the Paracel Islands of the South China Sea, which are also contested. Evidence of that will probably appear soon on Mischief Reef, he said.China completed a 10,000-foot runway several months ago on Fiery Cross Island, one of five artificial islands it has created in a large reclamation project in the South China Sea this year.The South China Sea is one of the top areas of disagreement between China and the United States that will be discussed during a state visit by President Xi Jinping to Washington next week.The Obama administration has called on China to stop land reclamation, construction and militarization of South China Sea outposts, a policy that Washington calls the ""three noes.""Washington has expressed concern that the military capacity on the reclaimed islands will interfere with freedom of navigation in the area, one of the world's busiest waterways. With these military runways, the zone of competition between the United States and China across the South China Sea has expanded significantly, experts say.But China has rebuffed Washington, repeatedly saying that it has ""indisputable sovereignty"" over about 80 percent of the South China Sea and the right to build what it wants on the Spratly and Paracel archipelagoes.In June, China's Foreign Ministry said Beijing would stop reclamation on the five artificial islands but would continue to build facilities on them. At the time of the statement, Beijing appeared to have finished much of the reclamation carried out by large flotillas of dredges.After a speech to Chinese and Western journalists in Beijing on Tuesday, Yang Xiyu, a senior fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, said ""difficulties between the United States and China on the South China Sea will continue for a long time.""There is little chance, he said, that the sharp differences will be resolved at the meeting between Mr. Xi and President Obama. The best that can be expected is a ""consensus"" to manage the differences, he said.In April, when satellite images showed that China was building the 10,000-foot runway on Fiery Cross, 170 miles west of Mischief Reef, American military analysts called the installation a strategic game changer. The size of the runway meant a fighter jet could land on the island, they said.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
"American Attack Killed Aide to Islamic State Leader, U.S. Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"WASHINGTON -- A deputy to the leader of the Islamic State was killed in an American airstrike in Iraq this week, the White House announced Friday.The militant, Fadhil Ahmad al-Hayali, also known as Hajji Mutazz, was killed on Tuesday while traveling in a vehicle near Mosul, according to a statement from the National Security Council. The Obama administration described Mr. Hayali as the Islamic State's ""Baghdad military emir and the emir of Ninawa Province.""Mr. Hayali has been declared dead before, including as recently as December 2014. ""This time we are 100 percent certain,"" said a senior official with the American-led coalition that is fighting the Islamic State. ""We have multiple confirmations he was in the car at the moment of the strike.""An Islamic State media operative known as Abu Abdullah was also killed in the airstrike, officials said.The administration said that Mr. Hayali was a member of the Islamic State's shura council, or cabinet, and was the senior deputy to the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He was a primary coordinator for moving large amounts of explosives, weapons, vehicles and people between Iraq and Syria, the administration said, and he supported Islamic State operations in both countries.Coalition officials said that on Aug. 3, 2014, Mr. Hayali led an offensive on Sinjar Mountain in northern Iraq, the traditional home of the Yazidi religious minority.The killing of Mr. Hayali -- who a Defense Department official said helped plan the group's successful offensive in Mosul last June -- struck a blow to the Islamic State's operations, the administration said, ""given that his influence spanned ISIL's finance, media, operations and logistics."" ISIL is an acronym for the Islamic State.The United States and its coalition partners have for months been conducting airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria. In Iraq, where the Islamic State has taken control of a number of cities and towns like Mosul and Ramadi, American war planes have targeted senior leaders as part of what the White House calls its effort to ""degrade and destroy"" the militant group.Since the airstrikes began last year, the United States military has killed several of Mr. Baghdadi's deputies, including the militant group's conduit for outreach to extremists in North Africa and a middle-level Islamic State leader who Pentagon officials described as the group's ""emir of oil and gas.""After most of the targeted killings, however, the operatives have been replaced fairly quickly, and Pentagon officials acknowledged that that would probably be the case again. ""This is not Baghdadi,"" one Defense Department official said. Counterterrorism experts said that the Islamic State had created an organic structure that inures it to the death of any single leader.Like several other Islamic State leaders, Mr. Hayali served in the military of Saddam Hussein, and was purged after the United States-led invasion, according to Will McCants, a scholar of militant Islam at the Brookings Institution. Mr. Hayali later joined Al Qaeda in Iraq, and was arrested and incarcerated at Camp Bucca in Iraq, where Mr. Baghdadi, the self-described caliph of the Islamic State, was also detained.Mr. Hayali ""rose through the Islamic State's ranks with Baghdadi, so the caliph has lost a capable and trusted lieutenant, if the report of his death is true,"" Mr. McCants said in an email.",1.0
"Airstrikes Kill Dozens of Civilians in Yemen, Aid Group Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"Doctors Without Borders said Friday that Saudi-led airstrikes on a residential district in Yemen's southwestern city of Taiz had killed more than 65 civilians, including 17 people from one family.If confirmed, it would be one of the largest tolls from airstrikes by Saudi Arabia and its military coalition partners since they began bombing Yemen five months ago in a campaign to crush the Houthi insurgency in the country.Witnesses in Taiz said the airstrikes started at about 9:30 p.m. on Thursday and destroyed more than 17 buildings in the city's Sala district. By the next morning, residents were still searching through the rubble with their bare hands to find survivors, Salah Dongu'du, the coordinator in Taiz for Doctors Without Borders, the medical charity, said in an interview.Nasser al-Qadasi, a resident, said, ""It was mass destruction.""The airstrikes were part of a new outbreak of fighting over the past few days in Taiz, Yemen's second-largest city and one of the country's most heavily contested battlefields during the current conflict.The Houthis, who have suffered a string of defeats in southern Yemen over the last few weeks, including in Taiz, had been shelling the city for the past two days, according to Rashad al-Shara'abi, a spokesman for the local anti-Houthi forces.The airstrikes silenced the Houthi artillery, he said. But at least five of the Saudi coalition's bombs also struck Sala, the residential area. Ali al-Sarari, a local human rights activist whose house was damaged in the strikes, said that ""many people lost their entire family.""More than 4,000 people have been killed in Yemen since the fighting between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis began in late March, including hundreds of civilians killed in airstrikes.

"North and South Korea Trade Fire Across Border, Seoul Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SEOUL, South Korea -- The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered his front-line military units to go on a ""semi-war state"" on Friday after South Korea said the two Koreas had exchanged rocket and artillery fire in the first major armed clash across their border in five years.No casualties were immediately reported from the exchange of fire that took place across one of the world's most heavily armed borders on Thursday. But tensions remained high on Friday, as Mr. Kim ordered his front-line units to be prepared to attack South Korean loudspeakers along the border unless they stopped blaring propaganda broadcasts by Saturday evening.South Korea, currently in the middle of large-scale joint military exercises with the United States, rejected the North Korean demand. Instead it stepped up its own military vigilance, vowing to retaliate against any provocations from the North.Mr. Kim ordered all front-line units to go on a ""semi-war state,"" one of his country's highest military alerts, from 5 p.m. Friday during an emergency meeting of his Central Military Commission, the north's official Korean Central News Agency said on Friday.North Korea issued the same sort of alert in 1968, when it hijacked the American spy ship Pueblo, and in 1993, when the standoff with Washington over its nuclear weapons program first flared.""Commanders were appointed and dispatched to the relevant sectors of the front to command military actions"" to destroy the South Korean loudspeakers and counter possible retaliations from the South, the North's news agency said. The front-line units ""should enter a wartime state to be fully battle ready to launch surprise operations,"" it added.The Kim regime has frequently issued bellicose statements, claiming that the divided Korean Peninsula was ""on the brink of war"" whenever the United States and South Korea conduct one of their joint annual war games, which it called rehearsals for invasion. But the latest threat followed a highly unusual exchange of artillery shells across the two Koreas' land border.South Korean military radar detected what appeared to be a North Korean rocket landing in Yeoncheon County, near the border north of Seoul, at 3:52 p.m. Thursday, the Defense Ministry said in a brief statement.Twenty minutes later, the North carried out another attack, said Col. Jeon Ha-gyu, a South Korean military spokesman. The South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted unnamed military sources as saying that the second attack involved several rounds from a 76.2-millimeter direct-fire weapon.South Korea responded by firing ""dozens"" of shells from a 155-millimeter artillery unit, targeting the rocket's launching point in the North, the ministry said.""Our military raised its vigilance to the highest level and is closely watching the movement of the North Korean military, ready to respond strongly and decisively to any further provocations from the North,"" Colonel Jeon said.About 220 people from two villages in Yeoncheon were evacuated into underground shelters, said Hong Seong-beom, a county official. Mr. Hong said there were no immediate reports of damage.North Korea said the South fired 36 artillery shells across the border, some of them falling near its guard posts but not causing injuries, the headquarters of the North's military, known as the People's Army, said in a statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency.North Korea denied the first rocket attack but did not comment on what South Korea said was a second attack. ""This reckless provocative mania should never go unpunished,"" the North said, reporting the emergency meeting of its Central Military Commission.The North's attacks followed repeated threats to attack the loudspeakers that South Korea had turned on along the border last week to broadcast propaganda.President Park Geun-hye convened an emergency meeting of the South's National Security Council on Thursday and ordered the military to ""deal resolutely with any North Korean provocations,"" said her spokesman, Min Kyung-wook.The exchange of fire was the first serious armed clash between the countries since North Korea carried out an artillery attack on a South Korean border island in 2010, killing two marines and two civilians. At the time, South Korea retaliated by pounding gun positions in the North.In recent years, the two sides have exchanged minor fire, mostly harmless warning shots, across their border. In May of last year, a North Korean patrol boat fired two rounds of artillery, which fell 490 feet from a South Korean Navy ship in waters near a disputed western sea border. The South's ship responded by firing several rounds of its own.Tensions have been on the rise along the countries' heavily armed 155-mile border since Aug. 4, when two South Korean border guards were seriously wounded by land mines that the South said were planted by the North. North Korea has denied planting the mines.In retaliation, South Korea last week began using loudspeakers along the border to broadcast propaganda messages into North Korea, a tactic dating from the Cold War that had not been used in 11 years. The North turned on propaganda loudspeakers of its own, and it threatened to attack South Korea's.""The fact that the North only launched one rocket without hitting any South Korean loudspeaker indicates that the North meant it as a warning,"" said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University in Seoul.Mr. Koh said that the North was unlikely to escalate the exchange of fire into a major skirmish, given the large-scale joint military exercise -- called Ulchi-Freedom Guardian -- that the United States and South Korea kicked off this week.But Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said that the situation could deteriorate if the two sides persisted in ""their confrontational posture in which one side's show of strength is matched by the other side's tough stance.""The Koreas are technically at war, the 1950-53 Korean War having ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.Photograph South Koreans at a Shelter in Yeoncheon County On Thursday.

"Attacks, and Accusations, Escalate in Eastern Ukraine:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"MOSCOW -- Fighting between government forces and Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine has escalated sharply in recent days, with each side blaming the other for the violence.At least nine people were killed in artillery strikes on Monday in villages and towns on both sides of a cease-fire line, and United States officials have said that one three-day period of fighting along the front last week was the most intense since a February cease-fire.Neither side has openly renounced the cease-fire, but European monitors of the accord say both have been pulling heavy weapons out of storage sites and putting them to use.The United States State Department blamed Russia and pro-Russian rebels for the uptick in violence. American officials have characterized the fighting as possibly a new attempt by Russia to destabilize the Ukrainian government.""Russia and the separatists are launching these attacks, just as they escalated the conflict last August,"" the department's spokesman, John Kirby, told reporters in Washington. ""Efforts by Russia and separatists to grab more territory will be met with further costs.""President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Tuesday blamed Ukraine. After emerging from a dive in a miniature submarine in the Black Sea off the coast of Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed last year, Mr. Putin said that, ""regrettably, we are now seeing this conflict escalation and the blame lies not with the Donbas militia but with the rival side.""Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said on Monday that the Ukrainian authorities had failed to carry out the political points of the February cease-fire, which he said called for Kiev to cede power to the two separatist regions.The Ukrainians, he said, are ""more concerned over how to keep alive Russophobia in the West and how to artificially whip up tension.""Before the latest escalation, four vehicles belonging to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe were burned outside the Park Inn hotel in Donetsk, limiting the group's ability to monitor rebel military actions.Ivica Dacic, the foreign minister of Serbia, which holds the chairmanship of the O.S.C.E., issued a statement last week condemning the arsons and subsequent resumption of fighting, at the time focused around one village, Starohnativka, northeast of the strategic Ukrainian-controlled port of Mariupol.Since then, skirmishes have become general along the length of the front, the European monitoring mission's statements suggest.On Saturday, European monitors reported hearing 184 explosions in Donetsk that were consistent with mortar fire on the front that runs through the city's outlying northwestern districts. South of Donetsk, along a river that roughly defines the front line, monitors found fresh craters from howitzers and rocket artillery on both sides.On the government side, monitors noted that the Ukrainian Army had removed eight Grad rocket-launching trucks from a holding area, where they had been taken to comply with the cease-fire.The separatist news agency DAN reported that artillery fire killed three people in the town of Horlivka and two in Donetsk.The Ukrainian Army reported that one soldier was killed in the fighting, and officials said that two people were killed overnight Monday from shelling in a Ukrainian-held village on the outskirts of Mariupol. A third resident of the village, a mother who had been caught in the open with her 10-year-old daughter while running for cover, died on Tuesday in a hospital.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"Piling Sand in a Disputed Sea, China Literally Gains Ground:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"WASHINGTON -- The clusters of Chinese vessels busily dredge white sand and pump it onto partly submerged coral, aptly named Mischief Reef, transforming it into an island.Over a matter of weeks, satellite photographs show the island growing bigger, its few shacks on stilts replaced by buildings. What appears to be an amphibious warship, capable of holding 500 to 800 troops, patrols the reef's southern opening.China has long asserted ownership of the archipelago in the South China Sea known as the Spratly Islands, also claimed by at least three other countries, including the Philippines, an American ally. But the series of detailed photographs taken of Mischief Reef shows the remarkable speed, scale and ambition of China's effort to literally gain ground in the dispute.The photographs show that since January, China has been dredging enormous amounts of sand from around the reef and using it to build up land mass -- what military analysts at the Pentagon are calling ""facts on the water"" -- hundreds of miles from the Chinese mainland.The Chinese have clearly concluded that it is unlikely anyone will challenge them in an area believed rich in oil and gas and, perhaps more important, strategically vital. Last week Adm. Harry Harris, the commander of the United States Pacific fleet, accused China of undertaking an enormous and unprecedented artificial land creation operation.""China is creating a great wall of sand with dredges and bulldozers,"" Admiral Harris said in a speech in Canberra, Australia.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, on his first trip to Asia, put the American concerns in more diplomatic language, but the message was the same. In an interview to coincide with his visit, published Wednesday in the Yomiuri Shimbun, one of Japan's largest dailies, Mr. Carter said China's actions ""seriously increase tensions and reduce prospects for diplomatic solutions"" in territory claimed by the Philippines and Vietnam, and indirectly by Taiwan.He urged Beijing to ""limit its activities and exercise restraint to improve regional trust."" That is the same diplomatic message the Obama administration has been giving to China since Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the secretary of state, and her Chinese counterpart faced off over the issue at an Asian summit meeting in 2010.While other countries in Southeast Asia, like Malaysia and Vietnam, have used similar techniques to extend or enlarge territory, none have China's dredging and construction power.The new satellite photographs were taken by DigitalGlobe, a commercial satellite imagery provider, and analyzed by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington research group. They certainly confirm the worries expressed by both Mr. Carter and Admiral Harris.""China's building activities at Mischief Reef are the latest evidence that Beijing's land reclamation is widespread and systematic,"" said Mira Rapp-Hooper, director of the center's Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, a website devoted to monitoring activity on the disputed territory.The transformation of Mischief Reef, which the Chinese call Meiji Reef, she said, is within territory claimed by the Philippines and is one of seven small outposts the Chinese have sought to establish in the South China Sea. ""These will allow Beijing to conduct regular, sustained patrols of the airspace and water, and to attempt to press its far-flung maritime claims as many as 1,000 miles from its shores,"" she said.Although these outposts are too vulnerable for China to use in wartime, she said, ""they could certainly allow it to exert significant pressure on other South China Sea claimants, such as the Philippines and Vietnam.""The issue poses a problem for the Obama administration, not simply because the Philippines is a treaty ally. China is working so quickly that its assertion of sovereignty could become a fait accompli before anything can be done to stop it.The United States has long insisted that the territorial disputes be resolved peacefully, and that no claimant should interfere with international navigation or take steps that impede a diplomatic resolution of the issue. But to the Chinese -- already flexing muscle in other territorial disputes and with the creation of an Asian infrastructure bank to challenge the Western-created World Bank -- this is not a matter for negotiation.When Mrs. Clinton raised the issue in Hanoi five years ago at the Asian Regional Forum, her Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, responded with a 25-minute speech, exclaiming: ""China is a big country. Bigger than any other countries here."" It seemed to be a reminder that its military could make sure no one would dare challenge its building spree on disputed territory -- and so far, no one has, other than with diplomatic protests.Since then, China has made no secret of its territorial designs on the Spratlys, creating at least three new islands that could serve as bases for Chinese surveillance and as resupply stations for navy vessels, according to IHS Jane's.Satellite imagery of the Spratlys publicized by IHS Jane's in November showed how the Chinese had created an island about 9,850 feet long and 985 feet wide on Fiery Cross Reef, about 200 miles west of Mischief Reef, with a harbor capable of docking warships. IHS Jane's said the new island could support a runway for military aircraft.The United States is about to conduct a joint military exercise with the Philippines, part of an emerging Obama administration strategy to keep American ships traversing the area regularly, a way of pushing back on Chinese claims of exclusive rights. The administration did the same when China declared an air defense zone in the region more than a year ago.The Chinese have said they consider most of the South China Sea to be rightfully theirs -- a claim others make as well. China and Japan have a separate territorial dispute over islands that Japan calls the Senkaku and China calls the Diaoyutai. Those tensions have eased slightly in recent times.Last year, China and Vietnam became entangled in an angry exchange after China towed a $1 billion oil drilling rig to an area 150 miles off Vietnam's coast. On Tuesday China's official Xinhua news agency reported that the leaders of both countries wanted to soothe their differences and ""control their disputes to ensure that the bilateral relationship will develop in a right track.""",1.0
French Commandos Free Dutchman Held by Al Qaeda's North African Branch:   [Foreign Desk ],,"PARIS -- A Dutch citizen held captive in the Sahara for more than three years by the North African branch of Al Qaeda was freed on Monday by French special forces, who mounted a rescue operation without knowing whom they were trying to save.French commandos raided a terrorist camp in northern Mali at 5 a.m., killed the fighters there after an exchange of gunfire and found Sjaak Rijke, the Dutch hostage, said Col. Gilles Jaron, a spokesman for the French Army's chief of staff.""This was an operation that was carried out with the knowledge that a high-value person was there, though we had not completely determined his identity,"" Colonel Jaron said. ""We knew it was someone very important, and we knew we were mounting a rescue operation.""Mr. Rijke, a former railroad conductor, was abducted from the hotel where he was staying in Timbuktu, the Malian desert city, on Nov. 25, 2011. He was freed on Monday from a camp near Tessalit, one of the northernmost towns in Mali, in an area that has served at least since 2006 as a base for Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the African branch.The commandos took Mr. Rijke to a French military base in Tessalit, where he was declared to be ""safe and sound,"" according to a statement from the French Defense Ministry. France has 3,000 military personnel in Mali and Chad as part of the so-called Barkhane military operation aimed at containing advances by Qaeda-linked Islamic extremists in northwestern Africa.Mr. Rijke had been visiting Timbuktu on an adventure tour of northern Mali along with a small group of other Europeans, including citizens of Germany, Britain and Sweden, when he was seized in 2011. They had arrived by motorcycle and four-wheel-drive vehicle and were staying at a small budget hotel on the edge of the city, according to Mahane Toure, a hotel owner in the town. He said the group was drinking soft drinks inside the hotel when gunmen burst in.The extremists herded Mr. Rijke; Johan Gustafsson, a Swede; and a third man into a truck at gunpoint. Jihadists in Mali have identified the third hostage, who has British and South African citizenship, as Stephen Malcolm. Family members gave his name as Stephen Malcolm McGown in an interview they gave to a South African media outlet.A German tourist who refused to get in the truck was killed on the spot. When the police arrived some 40 minutes later, all they found was the German's body and a stain of blood in the sand.One member of the touring group escaped harm, a European woman who has been identified in news reports as Mr. Rijke's wife. She was inside a tent she had set up on the hotel grounds when the assailants burst into the hotel. She managed to go unnoticed.Mr. Malcolm and Mr. Gustafsson were not found during the raid on Monday. They are presumed to still be hostages.The abduction put an end to tourism in Timbuktu, said Mr. Toure, who owns the Hotel Colombe, the largest hotel in the city. ""It was as if the sky had turned itself inside out,"" he said. ""No one came to Timbuktu after that.""Mr. Rijke was known to be in the hands of the Furqan Battalion of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The group issued a ""proof of life"" video last November showing Mr. Rijke bearded and emaciated, according to Jean-Paul Rouiller, director of the Geneva Center for the Training and Analysis of Terrorism.Intelligence officials in Bamako, the capital of Mali, as well as in Europe said that the ambassadors of the Netherlands, Britain, South Africa and Sweden had been meeting biweekly seeking a way to free the hostages. But the talks were stalled because none of the governments were willing to pay the millions of dollars the group was demanding for their release.Ransom payments have become a main source of financing for Al Qaeda and its direct affiliates, which have obtained at least $125 million through kidnappings since 2008, most of it paid by European governments or their proxies, according to an investigation by The New York Times.""He is one lucky man,"" one European intelligence official said of Mr. Rijke. The official asked not to be named in order to discuss classified information. ""There was a Ping-Pong going on between the different services"" of the four nations over the issue of ransom, the official said. ""He was found by a sheer piece of luck.""The Dutch foreign minister, Bert Koenders, expressed relief at the news of Mr. Rijke's liberation, saying he was ""happy and relieved that this terrible period of uncertainty and sadness has been brought to an end.""",1.0
"Bulgaria Puts Up a New Wall, but This One Keeps People Out:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"LESOVO, Bulgaria -- Less than two decades after the painstaking removal of a massive border fence designed to keep people in, Bulgarian authorities are just as painstakingly building a new fence along the rugged Turkish border, this time to keep people out.Faced with a surge of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa -- and the risk that they include jihadis intent on terrorist attacks -- Europe is bolstering its defenses on many fronts, including this formerly Communist country, which little more than a quarter-century ago was more concerned with stanching the outbound flow of its own citizens to freedom. For the past 16 months, Bulgaria has been carrying out a plan that would sound familiar to anyone along the United States-Mexico frontier: more border officers, new surveillance equipment and the first 20-mile section of its border fence, which was finished in September.The hardening of the Bulgaria-Turkey border is one very visible manifestation of the agitation across the continent about the economic, social and political ramifications of the surge in immigration. With warmer weather fast approaching and more refugees likely to be on the move, nations along Europe's southern tier are beefing up border staffing, adding sensors and other technical barriers, expanding refugee facilities, and building walls.More than 200,000 refugees are known to have penetrated Europe's land and sea borders last year, not including those who were able to sneak through undetected.And the numbers for the first two months of this year, when Europe enjoyed its second mild winter in a row, were up sharply compared with the same period last year.Anti-immigrant sentiment is increasing in Britain, France, Hungary, the Czech Republic and elsewhere across the continent. Parties espousing ethnic nationalism are seeing their support rise, some to the point where they threaten the dominance of more traditional parties.""The rise of the right wing in Europe is a reaction to this refugee flow,"" said Boris B. Cheshirkov, chief spokesman in Bulgaria for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.And with much of Europe still struggling to recover from the 2008 financial crisis, the higher costs of caring for this flood of refugees -- especially in countries like Bulgaria, the poorest member of the European Union -- are straining national budgets.At the same time, episodes like the January attack on the Paris offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo are raising worries that both homegrown jihadists and foreign fighters will cloak themselves in this refugee flood.""Right now, in the western part of Turkey, on the borders of Greece and Bulgaria, you probably have thousands of Syrian refugees waiting for an occasion to cross,"" said Marc Pierini, an expert on Turkey and the Middle East at Carnegie Europe, a foreign policy analysis group. ""If you talk about returning jihadists, you are talking about dozens.""Slavcho Velkov, a Bulgarian security expert and university lecturer, said he believed there was more jihadist movement through Bulgaria than the authorities acknowledged.""I have seen such fighters here with my own eyes,"" he said. ""I spotted some at the central bus station and struck up a conversation. When I asked them where they were going, they said, 'We are going to heaven.' ""To some degree, efforts like the new Bulgarian fence simply contribute to a game of Whac-a-Mole: When one route is cut off, smugglers shift to other paths into Europe.""In 2012, heightened security was implemented along the Greek border with Turkey, including the building of a fence,"" said Gil Arias Fernández, deputy executive director of Frontex, the agency that coordinates border protection throughout the European Union. ""The result was that flow changed towards the Bulgarian border.""It was this deluge that caused Bulgaria to institute its own ""containment plan"" in November 2013, including the continuing construction of the border fence, which will eventually stretch 100 miles.The impact was dramatic. The number of known illegal crossings fell to about 4,000 in 2014 from 11,000 the previous year.But that did not mean that refugees were not getting into Europe, Mr. Fernández said. Those thousands who failed to cross into Bulgaria were offset by larger numbers crossing from Turkey by sea to the nearby Greek islands. Smaller numbers tried making it to Bulgaria across the Black Sea.More than 170,000 refugees -- most of them from the Middle East, Africa and Afghanistan -- entered Europe on the sea route to southern Italy in 2014. In the first two months of this year, the number was up 42 percent over the same period last year.Here in the eastern Mediterranean, where Frontex measures land and sea crossings into Bulgaria and Greece, the number of those entering is up 107 percent over last year -- with the raw number of those crossing, 5,275, approaching the 7,834 who used the Italian sea route.""We are expecting a surge of refugees in April and May for certain,"" said Jordan Malidov, director of a Bulgarian refugee center in the town of Harmanli, 22 miles north of the Turkish border. Warmer weather emboldens those trying risky sea crossings or attempting to walk across remote, green borders.""And it is common when there is war for the numbers to increase,"" he said.Back in the late 1990s, when Nikolay Radulov was a deputy minister of the interior, part of his job was overseeing the dismantling of the old wall, a Cold War relic that had been the southern edge of the Iron Curtain. It was actually two fences, stretching across the entire land border, with a 500-meter minefield between them, designed to prevent residents of Communist nations from sneaking into the West.The fence was dismantled piece by piece, he said, ""and we very carefully removed each of the mines, one by one.""Now, as a professor of national and international security at New Bulgarian University, Mr. Radulov is watching with some disbelief as the new barrier rises to take its place.""The theory then was that it was antidemocratic to have these kind of devices along the border,"" he said. ""And of course, we were good democrats.""The new fence is rising on a rocky ridge, below which a pencil-thin minaret pokes through the rooftops of Hamzabeyli village in a gentle elbow of northern Turkey's green hills.""We post the men 100 meters apart,"" said Hristo Stefanov, the chief of the border patrol office responsible for this stretch of the frontier, pointing down a rutted road toward a distant man in black. ""That way, you see, the officers are always in sight of one another.""Immediately behind him was the western end of the 12-foot-high metal fence that rolls along the stony hilltop until it disappears around a distant line of gnarled trees. The fence, on the Bulgarian side, consists of chicken wire in a steel frame, while a menacing cascade of razor wire climbs its Turkish face.Only this first section is in place, along the stretch where most refugees tried to avoid border checkpoints. But the Bulgarian government, drawing on money from the European Union and other sources, and eager to prove it can effectively control its southern flank, says it will begin later this month to extend the wall until it covers the entire 100-mile land border with Turkey not already blocked by the Rezovo River.One reason Bulgarian officials are keen to complete the wall is to demonstrate to European leaders that the country deserves to be admitted into the Schengen group of nations whose members do not require visas or passports to travel between them. Bulgaria was admitted to the European Union in 2007, but has been denied Schengen approval, partly because of border issues.Although the Bulgarian government contends that the wall will be finished this summer, few security experts believe this is possible. Construction has not begun, and roads must first be carved through the forbidding, often mountainous landscape.In the meantime, refugees will continue to find ways across the border at more remote and dangerous locations.About 4,000 refugees are living in centers like the one in Harmanli, which holds 1,600.Tahani Halad Hamza, 21, was studying biology in Mosul, Iraq, when the fighting erupted there. Her father was lost in the conflict, but she, her husband, her mother and two brothers managed to make it into Turkey and as far as the Bulgarian border, where they were taken into custody about six months ago.Now what is left of the family lives in a small, red-and-white trailer in the refugee center. Like others in the facility, they said they hoped to be granted official refugee status by the Bulgarian government, which would allow them to travel through Europe.Her family hopes to get to Germany, she said, or perhaps Britain.""The only difference between Bulgaria and Syria is the conflict,"" she said. ""There is no work in either place.""Her mother leaned forward with wide eyes, ""Syria,"" she said. ""Boom, boom, boom!""Photograph A New Fence Along 20 Miles of Bulgaria's Border with Turkey.

Apparent Saudi Strike Kills at Least Nine in Yemeni Family:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- At least nine people from a single family were killed when what appeared to be an airstrike by the Saudi-led military coalition struck a home in a village outside Sana, Yemen's capital, officials said Saturday.Village residents gave a higher toll, saying that as many as 11 members of the Okaish family, including five children, were killed in the bombing on Friday. The airstrike may have been intended for an air defense base about a mile and half away, a Yemen Interior Ministry official said.Bombings attributed to the coalition have killed dozens of civilians since the start of the Saudi-led air offensive intended to cripple the Houthis, a Yemeni militia that has gained control of Sana and other parts of Yemen in the past eight months.The Saudi intervention, which began in late March, has exacerbated the fighting in Yemen's civil conflict and effectively blockaded the country, starving cities and towns of essential supplies and making it increasingly difficult for civilians to flee.The latest deaths came as the United Nations Security Council was scheduled to meet in New York to discuss a Russian proposal for a 24-hour pause in the hostilities for humanitarian reasons. Echoing the Russian proposal, the International Committee of the Red Cross called on Saturday for an immediate suspension of the fighting, saying the humanitarian situation in Yemen was ""dire.""""Our relief supplies and surgical personnel must be allowed to enter the country and safely reach the worst-affected places to provide help,"" Robert Mardini, the head of the operations for the Red Cross in the Middle East, said in a statement. ""Otherwise, put starkly, many more people will die. For the wounded, their chances of survival depend on action within hours, not days.""Red Cross workers have been trying to send in supplies for several days, but have yet to receive clearance from the warring parties, the group said.The southern city of Aden, which has been the site of street fighting for weeks, desperately needs assistance, humanitarian workers say. The Red Cross said it had been trying, in vain, to send in a surgical team by sea. Over the past week, three volunteers with the Yemeni Red Crescent have been killed trying to evacuate wounded people.Aid agencies are also trying to get supplies to Sana, which has been bombarded nightly by Saudi warplanes. Saudi officials have promised investigations into errant airstrikes, while blaming the Houthis for civilian deaths, accusing them of putting fighters in populated areas.A resident of the village hit on Friday, Dhiyazan Mohammed Khalil, said that if the attack was a mistake, it was an especially egregious one because the base sits on a mountain and the village is in the valley below.",1.0
North Korea Moves Forces Amid Talks With South:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea had deployed twice as many artillery pieces as usual along the border with South Korea on Sunday, and most of its submarines had departed from their bases, as high-level talks between the two Koreas aimed at breaking a tense military standoff stretched into a third day on Monday.Negotiators from both sides resumed talks in the border village of Panmunjom on Sunday afternoon, and continued their haggling on Monday, after a marathon meeting on Saturday failed to reach a compromise over the terms under which South Korea would withdraw 11 batteries of propaganda loudspeakers from the border. The North calls the broadcasts by the speakers, which include criticism of its political system and its leader, Kim Jong-un, an ""act of war.""As the negotiators haggled, the North raised the stakes by moving more artillery forces to the front line, a South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman said, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.""We have also detected 70 percent of the North Korean submarines missing from their bases, and we are looking for their whereabouts,"" he said. ""This is a typical North Korean tactic of talking on one hand and brandishing military power on the other to try to force their way.""It is highly unusual for so many of the North's 70 known submarines to be away from their bases at once, officials here said. South Korea has been particularly sensitive about North Korean submarines after 46 sailors were killed in 2010 in the sinking of a South Korean Navy ship, which the South attributed to a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine.On Monday, President Park Geun-hye of South Korea said that there was ""no backing down"" in the border talks and that the South would continue its loudspeaker broadcasts unless the North apologized for its recent provocations.""In order to stop the repeating cycle of provocations and anxiety, we need a clear apology and commitment from the North that these things will not happen again,"" Ms. Park told a meeting with presidential aides, according to her office.The militaries of both Koreas have been on heightened alert since they exchanged artillery fire on Thursday in a dispute over the loudspeakers. Although no casualties were reported, the clash was the most serious in five years.Since taking office in 2011, Mr. Kim has striven to prove himself a worthy ""military first"" successor of his father and grandfather, both of whom ruled North Korea before him, by conducting nuclear and long-range missile tests. But his inexperience in managing crises has added to worries about the current standoff. Some analysts fear that his frequent executions of top officials might make top generals more prone to attempt armed provocations to prove their loyalty and to survive his reign.Before the talks began, the two sides had sounded as if they were about to clash militarily. The North put its front-line units on a ""semi-war"" footing, ordering them to be ready to launch ""strong military action,"" including attacks on the loudspeakers, unless South Korea removed the speakers by 5 p.m. on Saturday. The speakers, a Cold War-era tool of psychological warfare that had been retired for 11 years, were returned to the front line on Aug. 10 after two South Korean border guards were maimed six days earlier by land mines that the South said were planted by the North.The South demanded that the North first apologize for the planting of the mines, which the North denies. While the talks were underway, the loudspeakers continued blaring propaganda.""What we see is the two Koreas challenging each other's nerve, going soft and tough at the same time,"" said Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul, the South Korean capital.The Koreas agreed to talk on Saturday hours before the 5 p.m. deadline for removal of the speakers passed. The sides have often escalated tensions, matching threats of war with tough talk of retaliation before retreating into dialogue and short-lived deals on improving ties.",1.0
"Arab Coalition Bombs Yemen's Capital, Killing Dozens:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SANA, Yemen -- A Saudi-led military coalition bombarded government buildings and residential neighborhoods in Sana, the Yemeni capital, overnight on Saturday, killing more than two dozen people, officials and witnesses said, and destroying homes in Sana's Old City, a Unesco World Heritage site.The Saudi coalition, which includes nine other Arab nations and is supported by the United States, began fighting Yemen's Houthi rebels in March, two months after the Houthis drove the government from power and took control of Sana. Coalition warplanes have sharply intensified their bombing of Sana in recent weeks, leading analysts to speculate that the airstrikes are intended to ease the way for a coalition ground incursion of the capital.The airstrikes hit the headquarters of the Interior Ministry and a military honor guard, killing at least 17 security and military personnel, according to government officials and witnesses. But several of the targets appeared to have no military value, witnesses said.One set of airstrikes crushed a group of houses, killing at least 10 members of one family and destroying at least two other houses, all in the Old City, which has been inhabited for more than 2,500 years.Other bombs struck an underpass, damaging a passing truck, as well as a four-story residential building.The aerial campaign has helped coalition forces advance in parts of Yemen, but has been marked by a persistent imprecision that has led to the deaths of more than a thousand civilians, according to human rights groups. The warplanes have bombed homes, markets, refugee camps and hospitals, but the coalition has consistently refused to acknowledge any culpability for the deaths.Errant airstrikes have become so frequent that critics of the coalition say they are part of a deliberate policy intended to terrorize the population and turn public opinion against the Houthis.On Friday, Unicef said that an airstrike in Dhamar, south of the capital, had destroyed a warehouse the agency used for water supplies, imperiling more than 11,000 people. Last week, the United Nations human rights chief called for an independent inquiry into violations by the coalition, as well as by the Houthi rebels.The bombing was the second major attack on the Old City since the start of the war in March. Around 11:30 p.m. on Friday, bombs destroyed the Ayni home, killing the family and damaging wells and several other homes in the area, according to Taha al-Maghribi, a neighbor. Mr. Maghribi said he had no idea why the family had been targeted: The father, Hifthallah al-Ayni, had no connection to either of the warring parties, he said, and the house was far from any military or security installation.Near the site of another attack that wounded two people in a four-story building, Hisham Abu Oraig, a neighbor, said a nearby government building could have been the target. ""But I don't think so,"" he added. ""The bombs are precise. They just want to scare people off.""",1.0
Turkish Forces Cross Into Syria on a Rescue Mission:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. ISTANBUL -- The Turkish Army sent armored troops deep into Syria late Saturday to recover the remains of a major historical figure and to evacuate the guards at his besieged tomb, the prime minister announced in a televised news conference on Sunday.The tomb of Suleyman Shah, grandfather of the founder of the Ottoman Empire, is 20 miles south of the Turkish border, but it has been considered Turkish territory under a 1921 treaty with France, which ruled Syria at that time. Fighters from the Islamic State extremist group have controlled the surrounding area and have kept the Turkish soldiers there trapped for months, although they did not assault the tomb.The prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said there were no clashes during the mission and only one casualty, a soldier who was killed in an accident.He said Turkey notified the Syrian government, rebel leaders and the coalition forces fighting the Islamic State about the operation. It appeared to be Turkey's first significant ground incursion into Syria since the civil war there began almost four years ago.Mr. Davutoglu said 572 troops, 39 tanks, 57 armored vehicles and 100 other vehicles were involved, and that the column reached the tomb shortly after midnight.""A religious ceremony was held for the transfer of the tomb remains, while other items of cultural significance were removed with similar care,"" he said. ""Our troops were safely removed from the area."" Finally, he said, the Turkish flag was lowered, and the tomb and security station were destroyed to prevent any possible use by extremists.The Turkish Foreign Ministry said the operation was prompted by the chaos and instability in Syria. The Turkish news channel NTV reported that the government had received warnings in recent days that clashes were likely to erupt nearby between forces of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and Kurdish troops known as pesh merga, and that the tomb could become a target.""The Suleyman Shah tomb has been a point of vulnerability for Turkey for a long time, and with this operation, such weakness has been eliminated,"" said Sinan Ulgen, the chairman of the Istanbul-based Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies and a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels. ""The Islamic State could have used the presence of the tomb as leverage in case of any confrontation with Turkey.""Mr. Davutoglu said that, in accordance with the 1921 treaty, a new tomb for Suleyman Shah was being established in a part of Syria that is under Kurdish control, the Ashme district in the Rojava region. Turkish television showed images on Sunday of the Turkish flag being raised there.Suleyman Shah, who died in 1236, is believed to have drowned in the Euphrates River, which flows south from Turkey through Syria and into Iraq. His tomb by the banks of the river has been relocated several times before, most recently in the 1970s to avoid being submerged by the reservoir of a new dam. Mr. Davutoglu said that when conditions in Syria permitted, the tomb would be moved back again to the site that was evacuated, near the village of Karakozak.Tensions have mounted around the tomb since March, when the Islamic State took control of the surrounding area and began threatening to destroy the tomb unless guards there lowered the Turkish flag.The militant group raided Turkey's consulate in Mosul, Iraq, last June and seized 46 Turks and three Iraqis as hostages; they were released three months later on terms that were not disclosed.That crisis discouraged Turkey from joining the United States-led military coalition conducting strikes against the Islamic State, though Turkey has cooperated with the United States in other ways, including an agreement signed on Friday to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels on Turkish soil.Turkey has lobbied intensively for international military action in Syria, including no-fly zones and a presence on the ground to strengthen the more moderate Syrian rebel groups who are fighting both the extremists and the Syrian government. Turkey is also concerned about containing the flow of refugees from Syria, more than three million of whom have already been sheltered in Turkey.The Syrian government issued a statement on Sunday calling the military operation a ""flagrant aggression"" because Turkey did not wait for permission from Damascus to mount it. The Syrian government said the mission's success showed that the Islamic extremists were Turkey's ""puppets.""The armored rescue column entered Syrian territory through Kobani, the border town that was recently cleared of extremists by Kurdish forces after a long siege. The Kurds were aided by airstrikes and other support from the American-led coalition.Mr. Ulgen, the analyst, said the choice of route was a sign of some improvement in relations between the Turkish government in Ankara and the Syrian Kurds, whom the Turks have regarded with deep suspicion.Turkey has opposed Western military assistance to the Syrian Kurdish fighters, arguing that they were an extension of outlawed separatist groups like the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K., that are fighting for autonomy in Turkey's predominantly Kurdish southeast.""The coordination prior to Saturday's military operation displays some agreement with the Syrian Kurdish groups,"" Mr. Ulgen said. ""This cooperation, however, should not be regarded as a game-changer in Ankara's approach.""",1.0
Drone Strike in Yemen Said to Kill Senior Qaeda Figure:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- A senior member of Al Qaeda who had issued a statement saying the group had encouraged the terrorist attacks in Paris last month was killed in a drone strike on Saturday, the militant group said on Thursday.Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said that the drone strike, on Jan. 31, destroyed a car in Shabwah Province, in southern Yemen, killing four of its members who were inside. One of them, the statement said, was Harith al-Nadhari, an ideologue who had publicly praised the attack on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The group attributed the drone strike to the United States military.The announcement was made by a Qaeda member who acts as a media liaison for the militant group.""These strikes came after the Houthis, who became America's loyal partner in the south of the Arabian Peninsula, took full control under an American supervision and an international conspiracy,"" the statement said, referring to the Yemeni rebel group that has taken control of the capital.Houthi fighters forced the resignation of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi on Jan. 22 and have been negotiating with other political groups to form a new government. The Houthis, though bitter enemies of Al Qaeda, have publicly opposed American drone strikes in Yemen. But they have apparently done nothing to interfere with the strikes since they took de facto control last month, and the American military has said the strikes will continue.The Qaeda statement on Thursday said the drone strike that killed Mr. Nadhari, whom it described as a member of the group's Shariah Committee, was the fifth since the Houthis took over.The earlier Qaeda statement about the Paris attacks quoted Mr. Nadhari as suggesting that they were meant as revenge against ""some filthy French people"" for insulting the Prophet Muhammad.""Some sons of France misbehaved toward God's prophets, so some of the believer soldiers of God rose up against them and taught them good behavior and the limits of freedom of expression,"" Mr. Nadhari said. ""Those who came for you are soldiers who love God and his messenger, do not fear death, and lust for martyrdom in the path of God.""While he did not name the attackers or say that Al Qaeda had planned the attack, Mr. Nadhari praised their actions and said that France would face further attacks if it did not halt its ""aggression against the Muslims.""""O French, until when will you fight God and his messenger?"" he said. ""If you become Muslims, it is a good thing for you.""",1.0
Jordanians Step Up Bombing Raids on ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Jordan sharply increased airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria on Thursday in retaliation for the immolation of one of its pilots, as the United States sent additional Black Hawk helicopters to Erbil in northern Iraq to increase the number of aircraft and personnel on call to rescue downed pilots.Jordanian officials said dozens of warplanes carried out strikes against militant targets in Syria, hitting ammunition depots and training camps. That number is a dramatic increase over the two to four missions that Jordan had launched at one time in the past against militant targets. American officials said the Jordanians had conducted 15 to 24 strikes.Jordanian military officials said the stepped-up attacks represented only a first wave. A rare public announcement by the Jordanian military opened dramatically, saying: ""This is just a beginning. You will know who the Jordanians are!""Even as Jordan was stamping its imprint on the American-led campaign against the Islamic State, which has seized territory in both Syria and Iraq, the Pentagon said it was taking additional steps to reduce the time it would take to reach pilots who are shot down.The United Arab Emirates, another member of the coalition fighting the Islamic State, has demanded that the United States put in place a more effective search-and-rescue system in northern Iraq, closer to the battleground, instead of basing aircraft for such missions much farther south in Kuwait.The Emirates suspended combat missions in late December, citing fear for the safety of its pilots after the Jordanian pilot was captured -- and later burned to death by militants -- when his F-16 went down in northern Syria. American military officials said that Islamic State fighters captured the Jordanian pilot, First Lt. Moaz al-Kasasbeh, within minutes after his plane went down, and that search teams did not have enough time to locate him before he was captured.A senior military official said that Lieutenant Kasasbeh's parachute had been spotted quickly by the militants and that he had landed right in their midst.But his capture raised questions about whether rescue teams would have been able to get to Lieutenant Kasasbeh within the so-called golden hour, after which chances of survival from a crash or injury drop sharply. When United Arab Emirates officials discovered that most of the rescue teams and aircraft were based in Kuwait, they said that their pilots would not fly until there was a system in place for more rapid search and rescue.Two days ago, the United States Central Command notified Emirates officials that they had sent additional rescue helicopters and crew members to Erbil, Defense Department officials said. Officials declined to disclose the number of additional Black Hawk helicopters, and it was unclear whether they would be enough to restart Emirati combat missions.The rescue teams and aircraft -- or their lack -- would apply as well to the recovery of any downed American pilots flying missions over Iraq and Syria.A senior administration official said American officials had been trying to navigate around resistance from the Iraqi government, which has objected to Erbil as the location of American helicopters and V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, which take off and land like helicopters but fly like planes. The Iraqi government has expressed concerns that placing sophisticated American weaponry in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, could embolden the Kurds' ambitions for independence from Iraq.Even after the Emirates suspended combat missions, the Central Command continued to issue news releases saying otherwise. As recently as Wednesday, the military task force in Iraq that reports to Central Command put out a news release about airstrikes in Syria and Iraq on Jan. 27 and 28. ""Coalition nations conducting airstrikes in Syria include the U.S., Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates,"" the release said.A Central Command spokesman, asked about the discrepancy, said that ""unless there's a formal declaration, we leave it as it is.""Pentagon officials said that the additional American search-and-rescue aircraft and personnel in northern Iraq would be put to use on behalf of all pilots in the coalition fighting the Islamic State.Jordan has been taking part in the air campaign for months, but until now had kept its participation relatively quiet, for fear of animating Islamist extremists at home.The killing of Lieutenant Kasasbeh changed that. The day after the Islamic State released a video of its fighters burning the Jordanian pilot to death, the official Facebook page of the Royal Hashemite Court posted a photo of King Abdullah II of Jordan in military fatigues, flight harness and black gloves. On Thursday, the king was filmed paying condolences to the father of the slain pilot as warplanes flew overhead. The jets were said to be saluting the pilot's family on the way back from the mission against the Islamic State.In Washington, both Democratic and Republican members of Congress called for the United States to move quickly to steer military aid to Jordan, and Obama administration officials indicated on Thursday that additional assistance may soon be coming. Several administration officials said they welcomed Jordan's stepped-up effort against the Islamic State.""These are very capable pilots,"" said Air Force Col. Edward Thomas, spokesman for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey. ""We're reaping the benefits of two decades of training together.""A video posted online Thursday by the Jordanian armed forces showed pilots who took part in the airstrikes writing messages in chalk on their planes' bombs. One wrote, ""Islam has nothing to do with ISIS."" Another quoted the Quran as saying the militants would burn in hell.",1.0
U.S. General Says Hospital Strike Was 'Avoidable':   [Foreign Desk ],,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- The top American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John F. Campbell, said Wednesday that several service members had been suspended from duty after an internal military investigation of the American airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz last month.Calling the airstrike a ""tragic mistake,"" General Campbell read a statement announcing the findings of the investigation, which he said concluded that ""avoidable human error"" was to blame, compounded by technical, mechanical and procedural failures. He said another contributing factor was that the Special Forces members in Kunduz had been fighting continuously for days and were fatigued.The strike, which involved repeated attacks by a Special Operations AC-130 gunship early on Oct. 3, killed 30 people, mostly patients and Doctors Without Borders staff members, and gutted the main hospital building. The aid group said the attack continued for more than an hour despite repeated calls to the military by staff members, and despite the hospital's coordinates having been repeatedly sent to the American command.General Campbell and his staff did not say how many people were being disciplined, or how. But a senior United States military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said one of those punished was the Army Special Forces commander on the ground in Kunduz during the fighting. The official would not identify the commander by name but said the officer, a captain, was relieved of his command in Afghanistan on Wednesday morning.Kunduz, a provincial capital in northern Afghanistan, had been seized by the Taliban in the days before the airstrike. General Campbell said the gunship's crew believed it was firing on a different building identified as a Taliban base in the city. He said that the aircraft's targeting systems had failed to deliver accurate information and that email and other electronic systems aboard the aircraft, including a video feed that would normally have sent pictures to higher-level commanders in real time, had also failed during the operation.American officials said that the Special Operations troops did not follow the rules of engagement and that the airstrike should not have taken place. After reading the statement, General Campbell left the briefing room, at his headquarters in Kabul, without taking questions.Following up, the spokesman for the American command, Brig. Gen. Wilson Shoffner, sought to deflect a reporter's suggestion that responsibility might rest higher up the chain of command. He said the actions of the aircrew and the Special Operations forces ""were not appropriate to the threat that they faced."" And he repeatedly said the service members involved had not followed correct procedures for airstrikes or choosing targets.Asked if the military's investigators had questioned General Campbell in the course of their inquiry, General Shoffner declined to comment. General Campbell was ultimately in charge during the attack on the hospital, but a military official in Kabul said he was in an aircraft at the time, on his way to testify before Congress on Afghanistan.""I won't comment on General Campbell's position, as he is reviewing some of the recommendations that have been made in his capacity as the appointing officer of the investigation,"" General Shoffner said.Many of General Campbell's comments raised more questions than they answered.The general confirmed that Médecins Sans Frontières, the French name of Doctors Without Borders, had succeeded in reaching the Special Forces commander to inform him of the attack about 12 minutes into the airstrike, at 2:20 a.m. But he said the strike was not called off until 2:37 a.m. -- after the aircrew had already stopped firing. But that timeline does not agree with accounts by the aid group and other witnesses, who said the strike went on for more than an hour.The aid group, which has called for an independent, nonmilitary international inquiry into the airstrike, was sharply critical of General Campbell's remarks. ""The U.S. version of events presented today leaves M.S.F. with more questions than answers,"" said Christopher Stokes, the organization's general director. ""The frightening catalog of errors outlined today illustrates gross negligence on the part of U.S. forces and violations of the rules of war.""Human Rights Watch reiterated its call for a criminal investigation. ""The Kunduz strike still warrants a criminal investigation into possible war crimes, but the Pentagon did not clarify whether recommendations made to senior commanders include possible criminal investigations,"" said John Sifton, the Asia policy director for Human Rights Watch. ""We are deeply concerned that any decision making about any possible criminal charges, if they are made, remains within the chain of command responsible for military operations in Afghanistan.""In his account of the investigation report, which is said to be 3,000 pages long but has not been publicly released, General Campbell said that the targeting system on the AC-130 gunship that carried out the airstrike pointed to what proved to be an empty field. Realizing that was not correct, the crew on the gunship decided to target the Doctors Without Borders hospital as the building nearest to the coordinates that matched the description of the intended target.""The investigation found that the actions of the aircrew and the Special Operations commander were not appropriate to the threats that they faced,"" General Shoffner said. ""We did not intentionally strike the hospital, and we're absolutely heartbroken over what happened.""Mr. Stokes expressed outrage at that account. ""It appears that 30 people were killed and hundreds of thousands of people are denied lifesaving care in Kunduz simply because the M.S.F. hospital was the closest large building to an open field and 'roughly matched' a description of an intended target,"" he said.General Shoffner said that General Campbell had directed that American soldiers receive additional training on targeting, planning and rules of engagement.Neither the commanding general nor his spokesman made any comment on the repeated assertions of senior Afghan officials that the hospital was being used as a base by the Taliban to attack coalition forces.""This was a tragic but avoidable accident caused primarily by human error,"" General Campbell said. ""The medical facility was misidentified as a target by U.S. personnel who believed they were striking a different building several hundred meters away where there were reports of combatants.""",1.0
Jet's Navigator Says Turkish Forces Gave No Warning:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- The Russian navigator who parachuted out of a warplane shot down by Turkey said Wednesday that there had been no warning before a missile slammed into the aircraft, giving him and the pilot no time to dodge the missile.The navigator, Capt. Konstantin V. Murakhtin, was rescued by special forces troops who followed his radio beacon and negotiated his release from the insurgents who were holding him.""There were no warnings from either the radio channel or visually, there was no contact at all,"" he told the Interfax news agency from the Russian air base outside Latakia, Syria. The pilot, Lt. Col. Oleg A. Peshkov, was killed by ground fire from insurgents as his parachute descended.Captain Murakhtin's account directly contradicted that of Turkish officials, who said the pilots had been warned 10 times in five minutes not to transgress into Turkish airspace, even the sliver of territory that the plane crossed in 17 seconds. The Russians have been adamant that the warplane was shot down over Syria, not Turkey. It crashed about two and a half miles from the border, Russia said, and the pilots parachuted into Syria.Captain Murakhtin said he and Colonel Peshkov had stuck to their combat flight plan and were flying their bomber in ""normal mode"" when the attack occurred.Given the speed at which they were traveling, he said, the F-16 should have flown a parallel course as a standard visual warning. ""There was not even a threat of crossing into Turkey,"" Captain Murakhtin said.Captain Murakhtin's account was sure to further inflame sentiment in Russia. Its defense minister announced on Wednesday that it would deploy its most powerful air defense system in Syria. Protesters gathered outside the Turkish Embassy in Moscow, pelting it with eggs and rocks, shattering windows.In Washington, a senior United States military official who was briefed on the radar tracking of the Russian warplane said Wednesday that the data showed that the aircraft transited Turkish airspace, as Turkey has insisted.""They crossed into Turkish airspace,"" the official said of the pilots, speaking on the condition of anonymity as the official was not authorized to discuss confidential military reports.Such data was not likely to deflate the pronounced anger and outrage on the Russian side. The country's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said Russia had ""no intention"" of going to war against Turkey but reinforced the sharp criticism of Turkey as a haven for terrorists that Russia started soon after the plane was shot down.Mr. Lavrov repeated that he thought the shooting down of the military jet was a premeditated strike and hinted that the United States had a hand in it. ""We have enough information to confirm that this was a preplanned act,"" Mr. Lavrov said at a news conference. Turkey was just looking for a ""pretext"" to shoot down the plane, he said.Mr. Lavrov suggested that the United States might have had a role in the attack, wondering if Washington had signed off on Turkey's firing an American-made missile. In addition, the accord that the United States negotiated with Russia on preventing accidental air force clashes over Syria was meant to cover allies like Turkey, he said, and he accused Ankara of not activating emergency communications.It was clear that NATO members were critical of Turkey behind closed doors, Mr. Lavrov said, yet there was no remorse.In Washington, the State Department said that Secretary of State John Kerry had spoken with Mr. Lavrov by telephone, urging calm and more dialogue between Russia and Turkey.The American advice appeared to have been ignored, as sources on the ground said Russian airplanes had attacked a border town that Turkey has suggested is the heart of a buffer zone.Syrian opposition activists said that Russian planes had hit the town of Azaz, in what appeared to be a retaliatory strike, for the first time since the beginning of Russia's military intervention nearly two months ago.Azaz, an important gateway to Turkey about three miles from the border, is in an area that the Turkish government envisions as a ""safe zone"" within Syria where refugees could eventually return. Beyond its location, it is not believed to have any militarily significant targets, and the Syrian government has not bombed it for months.On Wednesday evening, several warplanes believed to be Russian bombed a gathering point for private commercial trucks in Azaz, killing at least three drivers and destroying four trucks, according to Abdulkader Abu Yusuf, a local activist who spoke by telephone.Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said the downing of the plane on Tuesday would not deter Russia from its military objectives in Syria.In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he wanted to avoid any escalation with Russia, but he stuck to his position that Turkey was defending its own security.""We have no intention of escalating this incident,"" Mr. Erdogan said in Istanbul. ""We are only defending our own security and the rights of our brothers.""The Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, maintained that the plane had been brought down because it had not responded to warnings, even if it flew over Turkey for 17 seconds, and that Turkey was not aware that it was a Russian warplane when its air force fired.He called Russia an ""important partner"" but also called for an end to Russian attacks along the border in an area that is home to the Turkmen, an ethnic group close to the Turks.The shooting down of the plane was sure to aggravate attempts to forge a united global effort to confront the Islamic State and negotiate a political transition in Syria. Turkey opposes President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and the Kremlin intervened militarily there to shore up his rule, hitting insurgents backed by Ankara.In Moscow, Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu announced that Russia would send its most modern air defense system, the S-400 mobile antiaircraft missile system, to the Hmeimim air base outside Latakia where its more than 50 warplanes and other aircraft are deployed.The system, known in the West as the SA-21 Growler, is designed to hit targets at long range, including aircraft and missiles.Colonel Peshkov and Captain Murakhtin fell on mountainous territory of northern Latakia Province, which is controlled by a local militia called the 10th Brigade. Footage on YouTube showed insurgents on the ground opening fire at the floating figures and exulting over what appeared to be the body of one of them.Five Mi-8 helicopters bearing search-and-rescue teams consisting of Russian special forces troops and their Syrian interpreters were dispatched to find the pilots, following a radio signal that one was emitting, according to Russian news reports.The Russian special forces found Captain Murakhtin in the hands of local insurgents around noon on Tuesday and spent hours negotiating for his release, the reports said. He was taken back to the Russian base around 3:40 a.m. on Wednesday, Mr. Shoigu said. The whereabouts of the body of the dead pilot has not been confirmed.Mr. Putin said on national television that the pilot, Colonel Peshkov, would be posthumously awarded Russia's highest military honor, the Hero of Russia.Aleksander M. Pozynich, a Russian marine in Syria on contract who was killed when a search and rescue helicopter was blown up, will also be given a medal, as will the rescued navigator, Captain Murakhtin, Mr. Putin said.Asked by Interfax how he felt after his plane was shot down, Captain Murakhtin said he was eager to get back into combat.

Jet's Downing Is Culmination of Old Friction:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey and Russia promised on Wednesday not to go to war over the downing of a Russian military jet, leaving Turkey's still-nervous NATO allies and just about everyone else wondering why the country decided to risk such a serious confrontation.The reply from the Turkish government so far has been consistent: Don't say we didn't warn you.Though minor airspace violations are fairly common and usually tolerated, Turkey had repeatedly called in Russia's ambassador to complain about aircraft intrusions and about bombing raids in Syria near the border. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday evening -- and a Pentagon spokesman later confirmed -- that before a Turkish F-16 shot down the Russian Su-24 jet, Turkish forces had warned the Russian plane 10 times in five minutes to steer away.""I personally was expecting something like this, because in the past months there have been so many incidents like that,"" Ismail Demir, Turkey's undersecretary of national defense, said in an interview. ""Our engagement rules were very clear, and any sovereign nation has a right to defend its airspace.""While that may be true, analysts said Mr. Erdogan had several more nuanced reasons to allow Turkish pilots to open fire. These include his frustration with Russia over a range of issues even beyond Syria, the Gordian knot of figuring out what to do with Syria itself and Turkey's strong ethnic ties to the Turkmen villages Russia has been bombing lately in the area of the crash.Turkey has been quietly seething ever since Russia began military operations against Syrian rebels two months ago, wrecking Ankara's policy of ousting the government of President Bashar al-Assad. The Turks were forced to downgrade their ambitions from the ouster of Mr. Assad to simply maintaining a seat at the negotiating table when the time comes, said Soner Cagaptay, a Turkish analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a nonpartisan research group.""That would require Turkey-backed rebels to be present in Syria, and I think Turkey was alarmed that Russia's bombing of positions held by Turkey-backed rebels in northern Syria was hurting their positions and therefore Turkey's future stakes in Syria,"" Mr. Cagaptay said. ""So this is also an aggressive Turkey posture in the Syrian civil war to prevent the defeat of Turkey-backed rebels so they can hold onto territory and have a say in the future of Syria.""But the fate of the particular rebels the Russians were bombing in the mountainous Bayirbucak area where the plane was shot down is more than just a policy matter to the Turks. Mr. Erdogan particularly emphasized the ethnic tie in a speech Tuesday evening, saying, ""We strongly condemn attacks focusing on areas inhabited by Bayirbucak Turkmen -- we have our relatives, our kin there.""The Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said as much on Wednesday while dismissing Russia's explanation that it was fighting a common enemy, the Islamic State. ""No one,"" he said, ""can legitimize attacks on Turkmens in Syria using the pretext of fighting the Islamic State.""The bombing was creating political problems for Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Cagaptay said. ""In the days leading up to the incident, many newspapers, especially the pro-government publications, were running headlines highlighting the suffering of the Turkmens, who are closely related to Anatolian Turks,"" he said. ""I think the government felt that, in terms of domestic politics, it had to do something to ease some of this pressure that had resulted from the Russian bombardment against Turkmens in northern Syria.""Russia's bombing of Turkmen villages was to be the principal issue Turkey raised with Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, in talks that had been set for Wednesday but were canceled after the shooting down of the plane.Mr. Erdogan's emphasis on helping the Turkmens has another important political dimension in Turkey. Mr. Erdogan's political party emphasized Turkish ethnic identity and Sunni Muslim faith in the campaign leading up to critical elections on Nov. 1, as it competed with one rival party heavily composed of Turkey's Kurdish minority and another committed to preserving Turkey's status as a secular society and state.Mr. Erdogan managed an important victory in that election, preserving his chances of winning legislative approval to change the Constitution and turn the country's parliamentary system into a presidential one.Complicating matters further, Turkey and Syria have a longstanding border dispute in exactly the area where the Russian plane, a Sukhoi Su-24, was shot down, and Russia has sometimes voiced support for Syria's claim. It is a narrow strip of territory, the Hatay Province of Turkey, that runs south along the Mediterranean Sea, deep into Syria.The province is a melting pot of ethnic Turks and Arabs. It is also a religious mélange, with many Muslims but also a large Christian population, as Hatay includes the biblical city of Antioch. And the province has an acrimonious history.The League of Nations granted Hatay Province to France after World War I as part of France's legal mandate over Syria. Ethnic Turks led the province's secession from Syria and declaration of an independent republic in 1938, and that republic then joined Turkey the next year -- much as Texas seceded from Mexico a century earlier, became a republic and soon joined the United States.Syria has periodically questioned the loss of Hatay over the years. ""If you look at Syrian maps, that province, that chunk of territory, is shown as belonging to Syria,"" said Altay Atli, an international relations specialist at Bogazici University.When Hatay seceded from the French mandate of Syria, Hatay's borders did not encompass all of the ethnic Turks in the area; many Turkmens remained just across the border in what is now northernmost Syria. For decades, it was difficult for families divided on either side of the border by the secession of Hatay to even visit one another. Tensions finally began to ease during the years immediately before the Arab Spring, but they have resumed in the last several years as Turkey has led calls for the removal of Mr. Assad.The fact that Russia has over the years expressed sympathy for Syria's claim to Hatay makes the province even more delicate for Turkey, and Tuesday's incident with the Russian jet even more important, said James F. Jeffrey, a former American ambassador to Turkey who is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.He questioned whether the Russian jet had strayed into Hatay Province's airspace accidentally or whether Russia might have been deliberately allowing incursions by its jets during military activities in Syria because of Hatay's tangled history.""Turkey was tired of Russia's intimidating Turkey,"" he said.The Russian and Ottoman Empires battled for centuries for control over the area from the Balkans to the Black Sea, and vestiges of that bloody rivalry keep arising. One of those is reflected in Turkey's deep concern about Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, said Murat Yesiltas, the director of security studies at the Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research, a large research group in Ankara with close government links.Turkey now faces across the Black Sea a much wider arc of territory occupied by Russian forces. Many in Turkey are further upset by Russia's treatment of the Crimean Tatars, who speak a Turkic language and have opposed the Russian annexation. Most of the Crimean Tatars' leaders have been forced into exile by Russia, and this week Tatars have been blocking repair crews from restringing crucial power lines to Crimea that were mysteriously blown up over the weekend, producing a nearly total blackout on the peninsula.""Turkey wants to protect the territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" Mr. Yesiltas said. Turkey has already provided economic assistance to Ukraine, but it has been reluctant to confront Moscow more publicly because Russia is one of Turkey's biggest export markets and supplies three-fifths of Turkey's natural gas.With President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia saying things about the jet's downing like, ""We will never tolerate such crimes like the one committed today"" and warning of ""serious consequences,"" the biggest question perhaps is what comes next.Russia on Wednesday announced plans to deploy its most modern air-defense system, the S-400 mobile antiaircraft missile, to its air base outside Latakia. But while most experts -- and Mr. Erdogan himself, in remarks on Wednesday -- play down concerns of a wider confrontation, many worry that the biggest losers from Tuesday's incident could be the Turkmens.While the jet's two crew members were able to eject from the plane, Russia said that one of them was killed -- possibly by fire from the ground as he floated to earth -- as was a marine sent in a helicopter that was shot down by local ground forces while trying to rescue the pilots; the Kremlin said the second crew member had been rescued by Russian special forces.Several experts warned that Mr. Putin may step up his country's attacks on the Turkmens in retaliation.""They're the real target,"" Mr. Jeffrey said. ""He can just plaster them.""Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter. Sign up here.",1.0
A Top Militant Is Reported Killed in Pakistan:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- An American drone strike on Wednesday killed a senior commander of the Pakistani Taliban in Afghanistan, near the border with the North Waziristan region of Pakistan, according to Pakistani intelligence officials in the tribal belt.The commander, Khan Sayed, also known as Sajna, led a breakaway faction of the Pakistani Taliban.The drone strike occurred in the Damma region in Khost Province, near Shahadianu Patala, a Pakistani town in North Waziristan, the Pakistani intelligence officials said. They said the strike had killed 12 other militants and wounded 20.Another Pakistani intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, also reported that the commander had been killed in the strike.The Pakistani officials' claims have not yet been independently confirmed, partly because of the remoteness of the site and the restrictions on journalists' access to the area. There was also no immediate comment from American officials, who do not typically comment publicly on drone strikes.According to local elders, Taliban commanders were meeting to resolve the growing differences among the various Taliban offshoots when the drone strike took place.""Sajna was a leading figure of the Pakistan Taliban,"" said a senior Peshawar-based Pakistani military official who agreed to discuss the commander, a founding member of Tehrik-e-Taliban, the umbrella organization known as the Pakistani Taliban that was formed in 2007 and has been carrying out a bloody insurgency in Pakistan. ""Both Pakistani security forces and Americans were after him for long time,"" the military official added.If the commander's death is confirmed, ""it would certainly be a big blow to the Taliban, both in Pakistan and Afghanistan,"" said another Pakistani Taliban commander who gave an interview by phone on the condition that his name not be used.In 2014, Sajna publicly rejected the Pakistani Taliban's leader, Maulana Fazlullah, and said his faction would continue to fight on its own. The feud erupted after an American drone strike killed Mr. Fazlullah's predecessor, Hakimullah Mehsud. Sajna said in a statement that he was leaving because ""the present leadership has lost its path.""The number of American drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal area has sharply declined in recent months. The Pakistani military has also recently developed its own drone, which is being used for both aerial surveillance and missile attacks.",1.0
U.S. Strikes Try to Cut Taliban Momentum:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- In a clear sign of concern over the Taliban's momentum in northeast Afghanistan, the American military conducted two airstrikes on the group's positions in a remote corner of the country on Friday afternoon as Taliban fighters, driving captured Rangers and Humvees, quickly took over a pair of district centers.Ordinarily, a Taliban offensive in isolated Badakhshan Province might cause few reverberations in the capital, Kabul, and would most likely not set off an American military response.But this week, the Taliban captured Kunduz, a city of 300,000 people, in its largest victory in more than a decade.Clearly emboldened, the Taliban have carried out smaller-scale offensives in a number of provinces across the north, including in Badakhshan, a sparsely populated expanse of rival warlords and isolated villages. Since Thursday, a force has captured two district centers in quick succession, provoking widespread concern in the provincial capital, Faizabad, that the Taliban were headed their way.Beyond that, residents and officials in Baharak, the latest district center to fall, said that more than 1,000 members of the Afghan security forces who gathered on Friday morning had retreated as the Taliban attacked and seized the area. At 5:45 p.m., the American military conducted airstrikes on both the district of Baharak and its neighboring district, an American military spokeswoman said.Residents of Baharak interviewed by phone said that the Taliban's shadow governor in Badakhshan had been killed in one of the strikes, but that could not be confirmed and such reports often turn out to be wrong.In two other northern provinces, Takhar and Baghlan, the insurgents also made substantial gains in recent days. Those losses raise the question of whether the Afghan security forces, already struggling to respond to the Taliban's capture of Kunduz at the beginning of the week, would be able to contain emboldened insurgent forces across northeast Afghanistan.As recently as last week, the Taliban and the security forces appeared to be in a stalemate at the conclusion of a bloody fighting season that had led to a heavy death toll for Afghan soldiers and police officers.But the Taliban broke the stalemate early Monday with the capture of Kunduz. Most of the city's defenders quickly retreated or disappeared in a defeat that the Afghan government has since struggled to explain.In a sign of declining confidence in the government, several powerful political leaders and military commanders, some veterans of the fight against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, met in Kabul on Friday to discuss how to respond to Kunduz's fall and the Taliban's advances across the northeast.The extent of Taliban gains became more apparent in the days after the fall of Kunduz, as government reinforcements struggled to break through Taliban ambushes along crucial roads, sapping the Afghan military's ability to mount a large-scale counterattack.By Wednesday night, Afghan security forces had fought their way into Kunduz, but by Friday the Taliban still held parts of the city, including its central square, residents said. The fighting persisted in a number of neighborhoods, with reports of close-quarters fighting. Taliban fighters were said to be attacking Afghan troops in Humvees with rocket-propelled grenades and a machine gun mounted on a motorcycle. By Friday, residents reached by telephone reported a series of airstrikes bombarding the city.An American military spokeswoman confirmed that there were three American airstrikes on the city's outskirts over the course of the day.Doctors Without Borders, which runs the main trauma hospital in the city, said it had treated 345 people, including 59 children, since Monday morning.The number of dead remained unknown. Residents reported seeing bodies in the streets. At the Doctors Without Borders hospital, at least 37 people had died of their wounds by the time they were brought there.The hospital was running short of supplies, including blood, because the road to Kunduz from Kabul had been blocked by insurgents at at least two points. Trucks carrying medical supplies left Kabul on Tuesday, but by Friday they still had not been able to reach Kunduz.The International Committee of the Red Cross said that emergency medical supplies were ready to be flown in from Kabul as soon as security at the Kunduz airport improved.In eastern Afghanistan, shortly after midnight on Friday, an Air Force C-130J transport plane crashed, although the American military said it did not appear to be the result of Taliban fire. The dead included six crew members, who were American armed forces personnel; five civilian contractors working for the American-led military mission in Afghanistan; and three Afghans who were on the ground.""With high confidence, it does not appear at this time that enemy fire was involved in the aircraft crash,"" said Maj. Tony M. Wickman, an Air Force spokesman in Afghanistan.The cause of the crash was under investigation. It occurred as the four-propeller transport aircraft, assigned to the 774th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron, was taking off from the American base in Jalalabad.The fighting in Kunduz has led to an exodus of residents, not only from that city, but also from neighboring provinces, including Takhar and Baghlan. There, the Taliban have taken territory over the past week.By Friday afternoon, a state of anxiety had settled over many residents in the picturesque capital of northeastern Badakhshan, nestled in a valley.""I am afraid of Taliban and their brutality,"" one resident said as he described his plan to fly out of Faizabad with his family on the next plane. ""I am a moderate Afghan whose daughter and two boys are studying in schools.""He worried that even if local Taliban fighters left him alone, the influx of foreign fighters over the past year or two might kill him and marry off his daughter. He worried that other residents of the city might inform on him to any invading Taliban.""In fact, I am even afraid of my neighbors who know that I am a teacher who supports democracy,"" he said.",1.0
Foreign Ground Troops Join Yemen Fight:   [Foreign Desk ],,"AL-MUKALLA, Yemen -- The United Arab Emirates has sent a military brigade to aid fighters battling Houthi rebels in Yemen, senior Yemeni and United States military officials said Monday, in a move that threatened to escalate a regional struggle between Iran and the monarchies of the Persian Gulf.The Emirati troops landed in the southern port city of Aden in recent days, bringing with them tanks and other armored vehicles, the officials said. They quickly had an effect, participating in a rout of Houthi fighters on Monday from one of Yemen's largest and most strategically important air bases, according to a senior Yemeni military commander.A coalition of Sunni Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia and including the United Arab Emirates, has been waging a bombing campaign against the Houthis since late March -- largely driven by the view that the Houthis, a Shiite-led movement from northern Yemen, is fighting on behalf of Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival.The Houthis acknowledge their alliance with Iran but deny that they are acting as its proxy. The Obama administration has said that the Saudis are exaggerating the ties between Tehran and the Houthi rebels, who control Sana, the capital, and other parts of Yemen. The criticism has not deterred the Saudis from carrying out thousands of airstrikes and imposing an air and maritime blockade around Yemen as part of an aggressive offensive that aid workers say has helped fuel a humanitarian crisis.Apparently frustrated with an impasse in the combat -- as well as growing international condemnation of airstrikes that have killed hundreds of civilians -- the Saudi-led coalition recently increased its assistance to fighters battling the Houthis in Aden. Fighters recaptured the city from the Houthis last month. Some of the Yemeni fighters were trained in the Persian Gulf, and the United Arab Emirates supplied them with armored vehicles.Small numbers of Saudi and Emirati troops have been fighting in Yemen for at least the last few weeks, according to southern Yemeni commanders. The arrival of the Emirati brigade, though, marked the first time a large foreign force had entered the ground war. ""The U.A.E. and the Saudis are putting a lot into this,"" said a senior United States military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational reports. He said the two countries' aggressive military intervention said a great deal about their concerns over Iran's expanding influence.The Houthis and their allies still control large portions of the country and remain deeply entrenched in the north. But they have faced intensifying pressure over the last few weeks as they have lost territory and as the Saudi coalition has committed more military resources.In the south, the Houthis are struggling against a force that includes southern separatists, the fighters who trained in the Persian Gulf and now the troops from the United Arab Emirates.After weeks of trying, the anti-Houthi fighters said they had captured the Al-Anad air base on Monday after attacking it from several approaches.Al-Anad, which is about 30 miles north of Aden and sits at a major road junction, is seen as a critical access point to Yemen's southern and western provinces.The capture of the air base, which could not be confirmed independently, would be the second major defeat for the Houthis in less than a month. In another sign of the Houthis' growing isolation, Yemen's national airline told airport officials in Sana on Monday that it was stopping commercial flights to Sana indefinitely, said Khalid Al-Shayef, the director of Sana's airport.",1.0
Turkey Brings Down Russia Warplane on Syrian Mission:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- Two big powers supporting different factions in the Syrian civil war clashed with each other on Tuesday when Turkish fighter jets shot down a Russian warplane that Turkey said had strayed into its airspace.The tensions immediately took on Cold War overtones when Russia rejected Turkey's claim and Ankara responded by asking for an emergency NATO meeting, eliciting more Russian anger and ridicule. After the meeting, the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, called for ""calm and de-escalation"" and said the allies ""stand in solidarity with Turkey.""It was thought to be the first time a NATO country has shot down a Russian plane in half a century. And while few expect a military escalation, with neither Russia nor NATO wanting to go to war, the incident highlighted the dangers of Russian and NATO combat aircraft operating in the same theater and has soured chances for a diplomatic breakthrough over Syria.As President François Hollande of France met with President Obama in Washington to urge a closer and more aggressive alliance with Russia against the Islamic State, Turkey's decision to fire on a Russian warplane attacking targets in Syria has raised tensions between Moscow and NATO and undercut efforts to persuade Russia to drop its support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.Turkey wants Mr. Assad gone, and has allowed its border with Syria to be an easy crossing point for Syrian rebels, including those the West regards as terrorists or radical Islamists; Russia wants to prop up Mr. Assad and his government. While Moscow says it is attacking the Islamic State, for the most part Russian planes and troops have been attacking the Syrian rebels, some of whom are supported by the United States and the West, who most threaten Mr. Assad's rule.Mr. Obama said again Tuesday that Russian air attacks on moderate opponents of Mr. Assad had only helped him and that they should be directed at the Islamic State.Mr. Hollande and Mr. Obama clearly hoped that the bombing of a Russian passenger jet over Egypt, claimed by the Islamic State, would cause Moscow to make defeating the jihadists more of a priority than propping up Mr. Assad. But Tuesday's events will make that a tougher sell, for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia wants to be seen as an equal player in the conflict, not beholden to Western policies.Turkey, especially under the increasingly authoritarian rule of its nationalist president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been fierce in defending its airspace, shooting down Syrian jets that have strayed in the past. Turkey insisted that it issued 10 warnings over a five-minute period to the Russian pilot of the Sukhoi Su-24 to pull away.But Mr. Putin, clearly angry, responded that the Russian jet had never violated Turkish airspace and was shot down over Syria. Speaking in Sochi, he called the downing of the plane a ""stab in the back delivered by the accomplices of terrorists,"" warning that it would have ""serious consequences for Russian-Turkish relations.""Mr. Putin said that instead of ""immediately making the necessary contact with us, the Turkish side turned to their partners in NATO for talks on this incident. It's as if we shot down the Turkish plane and not they, ours. Do they want to put NATO at the service of the Islamic State?""A United States military spokesman, Col. Steven Warren, confirmed on Tuesday that Turkish pilots had warned the Russian pilot 10 times, but that the Russian jet ignored the warnings. Colonel Warren, speaking from Baghdad to reporters in Washington, also said American officials were analyzing radar track data to determine the precise location of the jet when it was shot down.At the emergency NATO meeting, Turkish officials played recordings of the warnings Turkish F-16 pilots had issued to the Russian aircraft. The Russian pilots did not reply. The Turkish account of the episode was described by several diplomats, who asked not to be identified because they were discussing a closed-door session at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels.After Turkish representatives presented their side of the encounter at the meeting, they received expressions of support for their country's territorial integrity, according to the diplomats' account.The Russian Su-24 that was struck was over the Hatay region of Turkey for about 17 seconds, according to one diplomat who attended the NATO meeting. But the plane re-entered Syrian airspace after being hit and therefore crashed in Syria, the diplomat said.Tensions between Russia and Turkey had increased lately over Russian bombing of Turkmen tribesmen in northern Syria, whom Turkey regards as under its protection and who are fighting to oust Mr. Assad. Just this week, Turkey summoned the Russian ambassador in Ankara to demand that Moscow stop targeting Turkmen tribesmen in Syria.""It was stressed that the Russian side's actions were not a fight against terror, but they bombed civilian Turkmen villages, and this could lead to serious consequences,"" the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.And so it has. The diplomatic spat may have led directly to Moscow continuing to target the Turkmens on Tuesday, and Turkey's aggressive response.What may make matters worse is that those same tribesmen say they shot and killed both Russian pilots as they floated to earth in their parachutes, having apparently ejected safely after the plane was hit by air-to-air missiles. The tribesmen then reportedly destroyed a Russian helicopter with a TOW antitank missile as it tried to rescue the airmen.The Russian Ministry of Defense said late Tuesday that one fighter pilot had been killed by ground fire and that a marine deployed on the search-and-rescue helicopter died but that the rest of the crew had escaped.NATO countries have been concerned about Mr. Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian tendencies for some time, and NATO officials acknowledge that Turkey's agenda in Syria does not always match that of Washington, Britain or France -- let alone Russia.And while he has recently allowed American planes to use Incirlik air base for sorties into Syria, Mr. Erdogan's own troops have largely turned their fire on the Syrian Kurds, whom Washington regards as its best local ally so far against the Islamic State.Turkey has been in a struggle for decades with Kurdish separatists in Turkey, labeling them terrorists, and regards the Kurds in Syria and Iraq as sharing the same desire to break away and form a Kurdish state.In a speech on Tuesday, Mr. Erdogan said there would have been more incidents like Tuesday's if Turkey had not exercised such restraint.""The reason why worse incidents have not taken place in the past regarding Syria is the coolheadedness of Turkey,"" he said in speech in Ankara. ""Nobody should doubt that we made our best efforts to avoid this latest incident. But everyone should respect the right of Turkey to defend its borders.""While Mr. Hollande is pressing Mr. Obama for tougher action against the Islamic State and plans to travel to Moscow on Thursday to meet Mr. Putin, Washington-Moscow tensions, high over Russia's annexation of Crimea, were highlighted again on Tuesday when Mr. Obama complained that Russian airstrikes against moderate opposition groups in Syria were bolstering the Assad government instead of trying to destroy the Islamic State.But the United States and Russia have different interests in Syria, and Mr. Putin has been clear about the need to preserve the existing Syrian government, if not Mr. Assad himself as leader. Mr. Obama, like Mr. Hollande, is committed to the ouster of Mr. Assad and believes that the Syrian strongman is complicit with the Islamic State -- from which his government buys considerable amounts of oil -- as a means of dividing his own opposition.In a news conference in Washington with Mr. Hollande, Mr. Obama said, ""I do think that this points to an ongoing problem with the Russian operations in the sense that they are operating very close to the Turkish border and they are going after moderate opposition that are supported by not only Turkey but a wide range of countries.""Turkey has the right to defend its territory, Mr. Obama said, but he urged both sides to talk to make sure they figure out what happened and ""discourage any kind of escalation.""Russia's retaliation so far has been largely symbolic. Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov canceled a Wednesday visit to Turkey, and a large Russian tour operator, Natalie Tours, announced it was suspending sales to Turkey. Russians accounted for 12 percent of all tourists to Turkey last year.The two countries are also significant trade partners. But ""Russia-Turkey relations will drop below zero,"" Ivan Konovalov, director of the Center for Strategic Trends Studies, said on the state-run Rossiya 24 cable news channel.Washington is not interested in getting deeper into Syria with ground troops or having a conflict with Russia. So cautious are the NATO countries about Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, which calls for mutual self-defense, that when Mr. Hollande declared ""war"" on the Islamic State after the Paris attacks, he invoked the European Union's toothless Lisbon Treaty and sidestepped NATO. Mr. Hollande was also, French officials have said, eager not to offend Mr. Putin by making Syria a NATO issue.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

Report Cites Human Error in Airstrike on Hospital:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- The American airstrike that destroyed a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz last month was the result of human errors, failures in procedure and technical malfunctions, according to military officials briefed on the internal investigation.""It's a combination of factors,"" said a senior Defense Department official, describing the findings in a 3,000-page investigative file examining the Oct. 3 airstrike that killed at least 30 people, mostly doctors and patients. The military is expected to give details on the findings at a news conference on Wednesday.Two other military officials briefed on the investigation said the Special Operations AC-130 gunship used was intended to target a different compound several hundred feet away that was thought to be a Taliban base of operations in the city.The military officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the report before its official release, said the investigation found that the gunship's crew had been unable to rely on instruments to find the target. Instead, they relied on descriptions of the location relayed by troops on the ground, a mix of American and Afghan Special Forces. Based on those descriptions, the crew locked onto the hospital compound, mistakenly believing that it was the building the ground troops were describing, the two officials said.It remained unclear if relying on such informal instructions would amount to a breach of military operational rules in an urban area with civilians present. And the officials' account did not address why the ground forces said to be in contact with the gunship would not have informed the crew that it was hitting the wrong building at some point during the hour-plus that the aircraft kept up its heavy fire.Doctors Without Borders has maintained that the American airstrike -- a continuing series of attack passes that gutted the hospital's clearly marked main building -- constituted a war crime.The group had reminded the United States military several times about the hospital's exact coordinates, and officials with the group made a series of frantic calls to the American command and other offices to try to halt the attack. Witnesses said the plane also appeared to track and fire at people as they tried to flee.""A mistake is quite hard to understand and believe at this stage,"" Christopher Stokes, the general director of Doctors Without Borders, said at a news conference in Kabul this month.The military's initial accounts were later found to be incorrect, and Gen. John F. Campbell, the top American commander in Afghanistan, has called the airstrike a mistake without explaining how the hospital came to be targeted. President Obama later apologized for the attack.According to the military officials, the building the gunship had meant to target was the headquarters of the Afghan intelligence service, the National Directorate of Security, in Kunduz. The city had fallen to the Taliban a few days earlier, and the officials said the insurgents had taken over the compound.Shortly after 2 a.m. on Oct. 3, the gunship opened fire on the main hospital compound, making the first of five passes over the building. By the fifth, more than an hour later, about 30 people were dead, mostly patients and the doctors and staff members who were treating them. The hospital, the largest in northern Afghanistan, was in flames.One official said investigators believed that the gunship crew did not receive a full preflight briefing, which could have contained information about the hospital's being a protected site under the Geneva Conventions.In addition, the United States troops did not follow their own rules in calling in the airstrike when no American and Afghan troops were in extreme danger, said another of the officials briefed on the inquiry.The American Special Operations Forces also apparently did not have ""eyes on"" -- or were unable to positively identify -- the area to be attacked to confirm it was a legitimate target, the officials said.",1.0
Jordan and Emirates Carry Out Airstrikes in Syria Against Islamic State:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Fighter jets deployed by Arab allies launched a series of airstrikes in Syria in the early hours Tuesday, as the United Arab Emirates returned to combat missions against the Islamic State for the first time since December, and Jordan separately continued its escalation of strikes against Sunni militants.A squadron of Emirati F-16 fighters struck Islamic State targets in Syria and returned safely to base in Jordan, the U.A.E. Armed Forces announced.Emirati officials said the concerns that had prompted them to suspend combat missions -- that the United States Central Command had not deployed sufficient assets closer to the battlefield to rescue downed pilots -- had now been addressed.Jordan also stepped up its raids; Mansour Jaboor, the head of Jordan's Air Force, said that Jordan had carried out 56 airstrikes against the Islamic State in recent days, as King Abdullah of Jordan continued to make good on his promise to avenge the immolation of a Jordanian pilot by the militant Sunni group.Bahrain's ruler issued a public statement that his country was ready to assist Jordan in the fight against the Islamic State, according to a statement released by Jordan's palace.Jordanian officials denied reports of a large movement of ground troops toward the Iraqi border, and asked journalists to ""be careful and to abide by the information that is issued by the concerned agencies and the Jordan Armed Forces.""""There is no talk about a ground war,"" one official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity in accordance with government protocol. ""We will not be reluctant to face this criminal gang in any place in the world to defend our religion, our nation, and the future of our country and our sons.But in other ways, since last week, when the video of the pilot being burned alive was released, King Abdullah has been stepping up raids on the Islamic State -- or at least increasingly publicizing them -- and working to increase Arab participation in the coalition against the group.The public announcements of increased Arab participation in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, is welcome news for the Obama administration, which has sought to characterize the fight against the Sunni militants as an international coalition with Arab participation.While American pilots have by far carried out the bulk of the combat missions in Iraq and Syria, the United States is loath to appear as if it is acting alone. So the suspension of Emirati combat missions in December came as a blow.American military officials maintained that Islamic State fighters captured the Jordanian pilot, First Lt. Moaz al-Kasasbeh, within minutes after his plane went down, and said that search teams did not have enough time to locate him before he was captured. A senior military official said that Lieutenant Kasasbeh's parachute had been spotted quickly by the militants and that he had landed right in their midst.But his capture raised questions about whether rescue teams would have been able to get to him within the so-called golden hour, after which time chances of survival from a crash or injury drop sharply. When United Arab Emirates officials discovered that most of the rescue teams and aircraft were based in Kuwait, they said that their pilots would not fly until there was a system in place for more rapid search and rescue.Last week, the United States Central Command notified United Arab Emirates officials that they had sent additional rescue helicopters to Erbil, Iraq.In an interview on Tuesday, Yousef al-Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States, said that Emirati concerns had been addressed.""The suspension of combat operations was made for purely operational and planning reasons, not political ones,"" Mr. Otaiba said. He added that the Emirates was ""fully committed"" to defeating the Islamic State ""and will not back down.""But far more than the oil-rich Gulf Arab states, Jordan is dealing with poverty and unemployment, said Hasan Abu Hanieh, a Jordanian expert on Islamist groups. The Obama administration has increased aid to Jordan, and Congress is prodding the White House to increase military assistance as well.Jordan, however, ""needs to make sure the public feels they have a real say in this,"" Mr. Hanieh said. Other analysts said that the most significant contribution that Jordan could make could be through its intelligence contacts, strengthened by clan and tribal links to Iraqis across the border.President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, in a rare interview with the BBC on Monday, denied the widely documented use of indiscriminate barrel bombs by Syrian government forces against civilian areas.""I know about the army,"" Mr. Assad said. ""They use bullets, missiles and bombs. I haven't heard of the army using barrels, or maybe cooking pots.""Mr. Assad also maintained that Damascus was being informed about airstrikes against the Islamic State, and said that they could help his government if they were ""more serious.""But the Pentagon press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said the United States was not ""communicating or coordinating our military operations with the Assad regime.""",1.0
North Korea Tests Five Missiles:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea fired five short-range missiles off its eastern coast on Sunday in a demonstration of its improving missile technology, the South Korean Defense Ministry said.The five projectiles were launched from locations near Wonsan, a coastal town east of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and flew about 125 miles northeast before plunging into the sea, a Defense Ministry spokesman here said on the customary condition of anonymity.The missile launchings came a day after North Korea said that its leader, Kim Jong-un, had witnessed the test-firing of a new antiship missile.Under Mr. Kim, the North has conducted missile and rocket tests more often than in the past. It is developing an intercontinental ballistic missile and trying to make a nuclear warhead small and sophisticated enough to fit onto the missile, according to United States and South Korean officials.Some of the North's frequent tests of short-range missiles in recent years have indicated that the country is developing missiles capable of more efficiently targeting United States and South Korean military bases south of the inter-Korean border, South Korean officials have said.Last month, North Korea offered to impose a moratorium on nuclear tests if the United States and South Korea suspended their annual large-scale joint military drills. Washington quickly rejected the proposal, and the two countries plan to start the joint war games in March.North Korea has called the drills a rehearsal for invasion and has often responded with its own military exercises and missile tests. In recent weeks, Mr. Kim has overseen field exercises by his military and vowed that he felt no need to negotiate with the United States, according to North Korean media.",1.0
British Planes Intercept Russian Bombers:   [Foreign Desk ],,"LONDON -- The Royal Air Force scrambled warplanes to intercept two Russian bombers off the coast of Cornwall in southwest England, the Defense Ministry said Thursday, as a government minister sounded alarms about the Kremlin's intentions elsewhere in Europe.The episode magnified concerns about the possibility of further moves by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that could draw in the NATO alliance after advances by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.Typhoon warplanes took off from an air base in eastern England and escorted the two Russian airplanes in international airspace ""until they were out of the U.K. area of interest,"" the Defense Ministry said in a statement. The encounter happened on Wednesday.""At no time did the Russian military aircraft cross into U.K. sovereign airspace,"" the statement said. During the Cold War, Russian bombers routinely tested Western defenses by flying toward the coast, and there have been reports that the practice has been resumed as tensions have mounted over the conflict in Ukraine.The number of intercepts of Russian military aircraft approaching Western airspace has tripled compared with 2013, British researchers said in November, citing NATO officials.""I suspect what's happening here is that the Russians are trying to make some sort of a point,"" Prime Minister David Cameron said during a visit to eastern England, ""and I don't think we should dignify it with too much of a response.""The Russian flights came as Britain's defense minister, Michael Fallon, said Mr. Putin could replicate the tactics used in Ukraine on the Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, former Soviet bloc countries that are now members of NATO.""NATO has to be ready for any kind of aggression from Russia, whatever form it takes,"" Mr. Fallon said, adding that he was worried about Mr. Putin's exerting ""pressure on the Baltics, the way he is testing NATO.""""You have tanks and armor rolling across the Ukrainian border, and you have an Estonian border guard being captured and not yet still returned,"" Mr. Fallon told reporters from The Times of London and The Daily Telegraph traveling with him to Sierra Leone. He was referring to an episode in September, when Russian operatives crossed into Estonia, grabbed an Estonian internal security officer at gunpoint and dragged him into Russia, Estonia has said.Mr. Fallon also recalled an intercept of Russian aircraft two weeks ago over the English Channel between Britain and France.""We had to scramble jets very quickly to see them off,"" Mr. Fallon continued. ""It's the first time since the height of the Cold War.""Mr. Fallon described Mr. Putin's strategy as ""a very real and present danger.""Mr. Fallon was also said to have asserted that Mr. Putin ""is as great a threat to Europe as the Islamic State,"" a reference to militants fighting to establish a caliphate in Iraq and Syria.In Moscow, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said Russia would seek a way to respond to Mr. Fallon's ""absolutely unacceptable"" remarks, which had gone beyond ""diplomatic ethics,"" Reuters reported.After the earlier flights over the English Channel, the British government summoned the Russian ambassador to demand an explanation.Russian military planes flying near British airspace caused ""disruption to civil aviation,"" the British Foreign Office said at the time, calling the maneuvers ""part of an increasing pattern of out-of-area operations"" by Russia.Dismissing Britain's concerns, the Russian ambassador said the patrols were routine.",1.0
Egypt Launches Strike in Libya on ISIS Branch:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- Egypt conducted an airstrike against an Islamist stronghold in Libya on Monday in retaliation for the beheading of at least a dozen Egyptian Christians by a local franchise of the Islamic State, in Cairo's deepest reach yet into the chaos that has engulfed its neighbor.Hinting at possible further action, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt said in a statement that he had convened ""a continuous session"" of his National Defense Council to monitor events in Libya and to weigh additional measures. But the strike itself, hitting in the Libyan town of Derna at dawn, was a new turn in the breakdown of regional order in the aftermath of the Arab Spring revolts and the Islamic State's emergence.Nearly three and a half years after the ouster of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, two rival coalitions of militias are battling for control over Libya and its vast resources, including nearly $100 billion in financial reserves, untapped oil deposits, and a long Mediterranean coast facing Europe. In the absence of any effective government or even a dominant force, a multifaceted proxy war has erupted as rival Arab states back competing militias and extremist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State seek to expand their operations.Mr. Sisi, a former general who led the ouster of Egypt's Islamist president in 2013, has watched with growing concern as a coalition of moderate Islamists, extremists and regional militias seized control of the Libyan capital, Tripoli, last year and set up their own provisional government.Together with the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Sisi has covertly backed a rival coalition that has coalesced around a Libyan general's campaign to drive out the Islamist and regional militias. Last summer, Egypt provided bases for jets from the United Arab Emirates to launch at least two airstrikes against Islamist forces in Tripoli, Western officials have said, although neither country has publicly acknowledged its role.Egypt's strikes on Monday now threaten to drag it deeper into Libya's messy internal conflict at a time when Cairo is already straining to revive a battered economy and suppress its own domestic Islamist insurgency -- centered in the Sinai Peninsula but now also fighting under the banner of the Islamic State.In this new theater, Egypt is highly vulnerable to potential counterattacks by Islamist forces, in part because of its long and porous desert border with Libya, but also because of the continued presence of large numbers of Egyptian citizens inside Libya. Egyptian workers often seek jobs in oil-rich Libya, and a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said Monday that ""hundreds of thousands"" remained inside the country.For its part, the Islamic State may consider Egypt's entry into the Libyan battle a strategic success, analysts said, in part because the extremists seek to capitalize on the spreading chaos.""They want to stretch the Egyptian military because they are fighting in the Sinai, too,"" said Aaron Y. Zelin, a researcher at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who tracks the group. He argued that the extremists would rally local support against Egypt's military interference -- especially if its airstrikes hit civilians -- but also that the Islamic State had built its ideology on cultivating such enemies.""They see it as proof that God is on their side, that even as all these forces are arrayed against us, we are 'remaining and expanding,' as their saying goes,"" he said. ""This is red meat for their base of supporters.""A similar dynamic unfolded this month when Jordan carried out days of bombing raids against the Islamic State in Syria in retaliation for its videotaped burning to death of a captured Jordanian pilot.Egyptian militants, including the self-proclaimed Sinai Province of the Islamic State, have killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen in the 18 months since Mr. Sisi took power. They killed as many as three dozen Egyptians in one night of coordinated bombings at the end of January.But the events that led to Egypt's bombing on Monday began several weeks ago with the disappearance of about 20 Egyptian Christians working in the mid-coastal Libyan city of Surt.Fighters identifying themselves as the Tripolitania Province of the Islamic State -- adopting the name of one of the three traditional provinces based on Ottoman-era divisions -- released a photograph last month showing that they had captured the Egyptian ""crusaders.""Then on Sunday night, the media arm of the central Islamic State group released a video headlined ""A Message Signed With Blood to the Nation of the Cross,"" which appeared to show at least a dozen of those hostages being paraded along a rocky Mediterranean beach in western Libya.All wore orange jumpsuits and were escorted by a row of masked fighters dressed in black with ceremonial knives at their chests -- details identical to previous Islamic State videos. After a short speech delivered in fluent English by the lead executioner, the fighters forced their captives to the ground, sawed through their necks and let their blood darken the waves.In a televised address later Sunday night, Mr. Sisi declared that ""Egypt preserves the right to respond, in the appropriate manner and timing, to exact retribution.""In state news media reports issued Monday around 8:30 a.m., the Egyptian military said its F-16 fighters had struck camps, training facilities and weapons depots belonging to the Islamic State in Libya. A statement from the military called the attack ""a response to the criminal acts of terrorist elements and organizations inside and outside the country.""""We stress that revenge for the blood of Egyptians, and retribution from the killers and criminals, is a right we must dutifully enforce,"" the military said, and Egyptian state television showed footage of the F-16s taking off in the dark as the statement was read on the air.The military statement did not disclose the location of the strikes. But a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Badr Abdelatty, later confirmed news reports that the jets had hit Derna, Libya, where some of the local Islamist fighters have declared themselves the Barqa Province of the Islamic State.Although far from Tripolitania Province, where the Islamic State group that killed the Egyptian Christians is from, Derna is close enough to the border for Egypt's jets to reach it easily without having to refuel en route. Western officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, noted that none of the three Islamic State ""provinces"" were open or visible enough to easily target, suggesting that even a prolonged campaign of airstrikes might do little harm to the groups.But the strikes drew applause from Libya's internationally recognized government, which relocated from the capital around the time it was taken over by an Islamist-allied militia and now sits near the Egyptian border in a town under the protection of Gen. Khalifa Hifter, who is leading the fight against the Islamists.""Egypt has helped us as we requested,"" Col. Saqer al-Joroshi, a commander under General Hifter, said by telephone in an interview with an Egyptian television network. Mr. Joroshi estimated that the strikes had killed ""not less than 40 or 50"" people.The Islamist-allied coalition, which calls itself Libya Dawn and has established a provisional government in Tripoli, sought to deny that the Islamic State executions had taken place, reinforcing criticisms that the coalition willingly collaborates with such violent extremists.In a statement, the Libya Dawn government dismissed the execution video as ""a Hollywood film"" contrived by its opponents. It called Mr. Sisi a ""terrorist criminal and murderer"" and charged that the Egyptian airstrikes in Derna had killed civilians. (Mr. Joroshi said no civilians had been killed; his assertion could not be verified.)In what was apparently a threat, the same statement also warned all Egyptians to leave Libya within 48 hours ""to preserve their safety from any revenge attacks.""Mr. Abdelatty, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Egypt had established an emergency consular services center to help Egyptians caught inside Libya get to safe havens or return to Egypt.The United States and its allies have tried to draw the Libyan factions into negotiations to form a unity government and dissuade them from demanding the complete military defeat of their opponents before any such talks.Western officials have previously argued that military escalations such as Egypt's bombing on Monday pose obstacles to a negotiated, political solution, but some have also acknowledged Egypt's right to respond to an attack on its civilians. A State Department representative declined to comment.In a statement, Mr. Sisi said he had sent Egypt's foreign minister to New York and Washington ""to ensure that the international community lives up to its responsibilities,"" because Libya had now become ""a threat to international peace and security.""",1.0
High-Tech Air Battle Against ISIS Is Slowed by Low-Tech Ground Fight:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ABOARD U.S.S. THEODORE ROOSEVELT, in the Persian Gulf -- Navy fighter jets roar off this nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in support of Iraqi troops approaching Ramadi, a city in Anbar Province overrun by Islamic State fighters in one of the worst defeats for the American-led coalition.The six-hour round-trip flights provide air cover for Iraqi troops on the ground as Navy and Marine fighter pilots and weapons officers drop bombs on Islamic State fighting positions. The American airmen destroy large trucks, weapons caches and the fighters themselves. No target is too small: They even strike individual heavy machine guns.And yet, 10 weeks into the campaign to retake Ramadi, it remains in the control of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Since the fall of the city in May, Iraqi forces have cut off some resupply routes into its center and have advanced to some outlying suburbs.Last week, in large part because of American airstrikes, Iraqi troops dismantled an Islamic State command base. They have retaken the University of Anbar, although American officials are unsure if the entire campus is secure.But the urban heart of Ramadi is still a no-go zone, with dug-in Islamic State fighters continuing to control the city, rigging neighborhoods throughout with explosives.From the flight deck of this carrier, the Theodore Roosevelt, it is the ultimate paradox: No matter how fast and expensive and advanced the American air campaign -- and it is all of those things -- warfare in Iraq remains a slow and grinding business.About 65 combat planes -- F/A-18 Hornets and F/A-18E Super Hornets armed with 500-pound laser-guided bombs, plus EA-18G Growlers for jamming enemy radar -- cost $57 million each. They launch one after another in a series of catapulted slingshots, soaring into the skies from the Persian Gulf, and head to Iraq on their missions. The F/A-18s can travel up to one and a half times the speed of sound.But they can go only as fast as their partners on the ground. In the new American way of warfare, those partners are not highly trained American troops, with more than a decade of combat experience in Iraq and Afghanistan under their belts, communicating directly on the telephone in English with the American pilots overhead.They are the Iraqi security forces, who tell their Iraqi commanders in Arabic where they need airstrikes. Those commanders then relay that information to command centers in Baghdad and Erbil, where American controllers then call the pilots in the air, in a convoluted game of telephone that can add crucial minutes to the overall enterprise.Nor do the Iraqi ground forces have the combat engineering equipment that their American counterparts have. Capt. Lanier Bishop, a 31-year-old Marine fighter pilot from Marietta, Ga., said last week after a few flights over Ramadi in his Hornet that ""not a single bridge around the city is left -- ISIL's blown them all up.""Normally, that would not pose much of a problem for American troops, who can lay their own bridges over the Euphrates River into the city. But the Iraqis do not have that kind of battlefield engineering equipment, and that has slowed them down as well.What's more, Captain Bishop said he had seen destroyed highway overpasses, apparently blown up by the Islamic State, that block access into the city, further slowing the pace of the advance. And the militants have laid booby traps and bombs along routes into the city, American pilots said.From the cockpit of his F/A-18 fighter jet a few days ago, Capt. Benjamin Hewlett of the Navy, commander of the carrier's air wing, said he had watched a convoy of Iraqi forces move inch by excruciating inch across a road outside Ramadi. ""Every time you have an asymmetric threat like ISIS, they booby-trap everything, and that slows down the progress,"" he said in an interview aboard the Roosevelt.But, he added, ""the opposite of slow and deliberate is fast and sloppy, and then not always the right people die.""""The Iraqis are not interested in destroying Anbar University, and they are putting themselves at a lot of risk so that they don't do so,"" he said.Vice Adm. John W. Miller, commander of the Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, voiced some optimism. ""Eventually, I think we'll be successful, but we're only able to go as fast as the Iraqi security forces can go,"" he said.On the enormous flight deck of the Roosevelt -- the Navy likes to describe its carriers as five acres of sovereign territory -- things look anything but slow. More than 5,000 bustling sailors in helmets, goggles, safety vests and color-coded shirts (the better to figure out who is doing what) move quickly between loud fighter jets.The sailors in the red shirts are the ones who handle the bombs. The ones in blue shirts handle the aircraft elevators, while the ones in the white shirts are safety workers. The ones in purple handle fuel, the ones in green handle the catapults that sling the planes into the air, and the ones in yellow direct the pilots to take off and land.On deck it is 113 degrees, and with the humidity the heat index regularly reaches 150 degrees.As a fighter jet gets ready to take off, the scene becomes almost like ballet. The ""shooters,"" the sailors in the yellow shirts, move in synchronized formation to direct the pilots, since no one can hear amid all the noise. For each flight, two shooters use their entire bodies to signal the pilots.They hold their hands above their heads with two fingers up, then make fists, then wave again, then make fists again, then hold their arms straight out to the side, in the direction the plane is supposed to go.That is just the start. After that the sailors do a karate chop, wag their fingers, point and then squat to touch their index fingers on the deck to indicate everything is clear for takeoff. And then, finally, they point straight ahead from the squatting position, and the catapults release the screaming planes into the air.For the airmen, it is then on to Iraq -- not only to Ramadi, but also to Baiji, where Iraqi forces and Islamic State militants have been battling for months, and to Sinjar, where the persecution of Yazidis first prompted American airstrikes a year ago, and where Islamic State militants still battle for territory.It is not always dramatic work.Last Thursday, Lt. Michael Smallwood, 28, from Hilliard, Ohio, and Lt. John Izzo, 27, from North Babylon, N.Y., took off in their F/A-18 fighters in the scorching sun a little after 4 p.m. The heat index had just begun climbing down from 140 degrees. After refueling in the skies over southern Iraq, the two jets headed first toward Kisik Junction, a city west of Mosul, where Kurdish forces have battled Islamic State militants. The command came to Lieutenant Smallwood to scan the area for militants. He saw none, and 15 minutes later both he and Lieutenant Izzo needed to refuel. They left Kisik Junction for the refueling, but then got an order to move to Baiji, north of Ramadi. There they scanned again for militants but saw nothing before it was time to return to the Roosevelt for what the Navy calls an ""arrested landing"" -- the tailhook of the plane catches a wire and goes from 150 miles an hour to zero in about two seconds.A frustrating day? Lieutenant Izzo shrugged. ""Sometimes it's frustrating,"" he said. ""But it's never boring.""Photograph The Nuclear-Powered Aircraft Carrier Theodore Roosevelt in the Persian Gulf, Where It Coordinates Airstrikes On Isis Positions Involving 65 Combat Planes.; Sailors Aboard the Carrier Prepared Jets for Six-Hour Round-Trip Missions to Provide Air Cover for Iraqi Troops On the Ground, During Which Navy and Marine Fighter Pilots and Weapons Officers Bomb Islamic State Positions.

South Korea Accuses North After Mines Maim 2 in the Demilitarized Zone:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean soldiers sneaked across the heavily guarded border with South Korea and planted land mines near one of the South's military guard posts, and two southern soldiers were maimed after stepping on them, the South Korean Defense Ministry said Monday.The two South Koreans, both staff sergeants, triggered the mines on Aug. 4 just outside their post, within the South Korean half of the 2.5-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone, a buffer separating the two Korean armies.One soldier lost both legs in the first blast, involving two mines. The other soldier lost one leg in a second explosion as he tried to help his wounded colleague to safety, the ministry said.""This is a clear provocation by the North Korean military,"" said Kim Min-seok, a spokesman for the South Korean military. ""We swear a severe retaliation.""Investigations showed that the mines were planted by North Korean soldiers to target troops from the South, Maj. Gen. Koo Hong-mo said at a news briefing. They were typical land mines from the North that used wooden boxes, he said.The mines were found just outside the South Korean guard post, which is 1,440 feet south of the military demarcation line, the official border that bisects the DMZ. They exploded as the soldiers opened the gate of a barbed-wire fence to begin a routine morning patrol, said Brig. Gen. Ahn Young-ho, a military investigator.The explosions last week were the first of their kind in 48 years, South Korean officials said.During and after the Korean War, both Koreas planted hundreds of thousands of mines in and near each side of the DMZ to thwart infiltrators.Hundreds of South Korean villagers near the border have been injured or killed after stepping on or picking up stray mines.The blasts last week took place near Paju, a front-line town north of Seoul. They were especially shocking because South Korean officials said that infiltrators from the North had come within striking distance of a South Korean guard post and had retreated, undetected, after planting three mines on both sides of a barbed-wire fence protecting the post.General Koo said that the North Koreans probably planted the mines between July 22, when South Korean guards last used the gate, and Aug. 4, when the soldiers were wounded.Officials here said that the last episodes in which South Korean troops had been killed or wounded by similarly planted North Korean mines inside the DMZ took place in 1967.""For the North, this is a low-cost provocation that creates a big psychological impact on the South,"" said Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University in Seoul. ""Those North Korean wooden box land mines usually blow away legs only, not always killing their victims.""Mr. Kim said that the episode was unlikely to lead to an armed skirmish on the tense border but that it would probably harden the South's stance on the North and hamper any short-term efforts to improve ties.The North has not responded to the South Korean accusation. If the mines were indeed planted by the North, it would be one of its most daring provocations since it shelled a South Korean island in 2010, killing four.The American-led United Nations Command, which oversees the Korean armistice and investigated the mine episode with the South, said it ""condemns these violations"" of the armistice and called for talks between generals from the command and the North.Both the command and the South Korean military ruled out the possibility that the mines were old ones that had drifted from their original placements because of rain or shifting soil.The DMZ was created in 1953 as part of the Korean War armistice. The armistice has never been replaced with a peace treaty, leaving the divided Korean Peninsula technically in a state of war.Both Koreas protect their sides of the DMZ with guard posts, barbed-wire fences and minefields. So many mines are there that wild deer sometimes step on them, causing blasts.Old mines loosened by floodwaters also pose a risk for soldiers serving in the zone. In 2010, dozens of North Korean land mines moved into the South through floodwaters, killing one villager and scaring vacationers away from rivers and beaches near the border.According to a 2011 survey, 116 villagers have been killed by mines in Gangwon, one of the two South Korean provinces on the border with the North.Despite the booby traps, armed commandos and spies from both sides often infiltrated the border in the years after the Korean War, though both governments have officially said that such infiltrations stopped since the 1970s.In recent years, South Korea has installed numerous closed-circuit and heat-detecting cameras along the border and around its guard posts.But its efforts to detect infiltrators were often hampered by lush summer forests inside the DMZ, officials said. (One of the two blasts last week was captured by such a camera, and its footage was released by the Defense Ministry.)The South Korean military's vigilance came under scrutiny in recent years, as several defectors from the North have crawled across the DMZ to South Korean guard posts.In 2012, sentries from the South did not know of an infiltration until a defecting North Korean soldier knocked on a window of their guard post.In June, another soldier from the North arrived at a guard post in South Korea and spent a night outside, undetected, before turning himself in the next morning.Later Monday, South Korea resumed loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts across the border for the first time in 11 years. Such broadcasts, including bitter criticism of the North's government, were suspended in 2004 as part of efforts at reconciliation.Conservative South Koreans have called for the resumption of the broadcasts as relations have deteriorated in recent years.The North, meanwhile, has threatened to attack the loudspeakers if the broadcasts resume.Photograph A South Korean Patrol Sunday Near the Site of Two Land Mine Explosions Last Week in the Demilitarized Zone.

Air Attacks Said to Kill 23 in Yemen:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- Airstrikes by a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia hit a house south of the capital on Wednesday, killing at least 23 people who were attending a wedding party, said witnesses and a local medical worker.The attack was the second airstrike on a wedding in Yemen in a little over a week, and it added to growing criticism over the coalition's air campaign, which has killed more than 1,100 civilians over the past six months, according to the United Nations.On Sept. 28, coalition warplanes bombed wedding tents on the Yemen's Red Sea coast, killing at least 70 people.Saudi Arabia launched a military offensive in March against rebels known as the Houthis after they drove the Saudi-backed government from power. As war has spread throughout the country, more than 2,355 civilians have been killed -- the majority of them in coalition airstrikes, human rights workers say.The airstrikes on Wednesday were in Dhamar Province, about 50 miles south of Sana, the capital, on the house of Muhammed al-Sanabani, said a cousin, Tawfiq al-Sanabani, who was nearby.Three of Muhammed al-Sanabani's sons were to be married in a joint ceremony on Wednesday night, the cousin said. The airstrikes occurred just as the brides had arrived at the house. At least one of the sons was killed in the attack, Mr. Sanabani said.""I saw bodies lying in the yard, decapitated, charred,"" he said.Safwan al-Ansi, the chief of the emergency department at the Dhamar health office, said that 23 people had been killed but that more bodies were still under the rubble of the house. Mr. Sanabani said he did not know why the house had been targeted.",1.0
Russian Violations of Turkish Airspace Are Seen in West as a Test:   [Foreign Desk ],,"For what NATO's secretary general described as a ""long time"" and Russia's Defense Ministry characterized as just ""a few seconds,"" a Russian fighter jet violated Turkey's airspace on Saturday, increasing tensions and raising concerns about Russian aggression beyond mere saber rattling.NATO said that a Russian aircraft also violated Turkish airspace on Sunday. The response was swift from Western powers that were already anxious about Russian warplanes flying near their own aircraft in Syria and near their own sovereign airspace.Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, said that a pilot flew into Turkish airspace on Saturday by mistake, because ""of unfavorable weather conditions in that area,"" according to Tass, Russia's government-owned news agency.But Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, said ""it doesn't look like an accident,"" and there have been a number of other instances recently of Russian military flights entering the airspace of NATO members or coming very close, prompting interception by Western military aircraft.The presumed purpose of such incursions is to gauge the target country's reactions. Which radar systems and which missile batteries are activated and reveal themselves? Which planes are scrambled from which bases, and how quickly? How loudly and publicly do leaders complain, and how much backing do they get at home and from international allies?In February, as tensions mounted in Ukraine, the Royal Air Force scrambled warplanes to intercept Russian bombers flying off the coast of Cornwall in southwest England. The incident carried echoes of the Cold War, when Soviet aircraft would routinely test Western defenses in this way, and NATO would do the same to the Soviet bloc.The February encounter was the closest to occur near England in decades. British researchers noted at the time, citing NATO officials, that the number of Russian aircraft intercepted as they approached Western airspace had tripled from 2013.In 2014, Norway scrambled F-16 fighters to intercept Russian warplanes off its coast 74 times, a 27 percent increase from 2013. The Russians did not actually violate Norwegian airspace, but they have done so in the Baltic nations, which were once part of the Soviet Union.In October 2014, NATO reported an ""unusual"" spike in Russian military flights across Europe, according to The Associated Press. The alliance observed large-scale maneuvers in international airspace involving Tu-95 Bear H strategic bombers, MiG-31 fighters and other Russian warplanes.Norway, Britain, Portugal, Germany, Denmark and Turkey scrambled fighters in response; so did two non-NATO countries, Finland and Sweden, according to The A.P.Russia's involvement in Syria is the first time in a generation that it has conducted military operations outside the former borders of the Soviet Union. Though Russia maintains that its airstrikes target the Islamic State militant group, just as the American-led coalition's airstrikes do, Western officials say Russian forces have actually been attacking other rebel groups, including some that receive assistance from the United States.Though the Russians have so far mounted most of their airstrikes far from areas where the American-led coalition mainly operates, the skies over Syria are now crowded with military aircraft.The risk of accidents and unplanned confrontations has risen, prompting calls from Western countries for greater coordination between the United States and Russia.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"At Parade, North Korea Flaunts New Missiles and China Ties:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SEOUL, South Korea -- Long columns of goose-stepping soldiers, accompanied by what North Korea claimed were nuclear-tipped missiles, marched through central Pyongyang, the capital, on Saturday, as the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, gave his first public speech in three years to emphasize his ""love for the people"" and declare his readiness to ""fight any form of war"" with the United States.Mr. Kim celebrated the 70th anniversary of his ruling Workers' Party on Saturday with what appeared to be one of the largest military parades the North had ever organized. As warplanes flew overhead, the plaza in Pyongyang was filled with soldiers and citizens chanting slogans of loyalty to the Kim family and waving pink and red artificial flowers in synchronized moves.In a 25-minute speech before the parade, Mr. Kim spoke of his ""love"" and ""dedication to the people,"" whom he thanked for staying with his party through decades of American-led economic sanctions and blockades.In his first public speech, before a similar military parade in 2012, Mr. Kim promised that North Koreans would ""never have to tighten their belt again."" Pyongyang, the showpiece capital where the people most loyal to the regime are allowed to live, has since gone through a major face-lift. But economic conditions for people in the rest of North Korea remain dire, according to international human rights groups.Mr. Kim's efforts to reinvigorate the economy are hampered by United Nations sanctions, prompted by the North's nuclear and long-range missile programs. His government also spends lavishly to maintain the personality cult surrounding his family.On Saturday, Mr. Kim did not mention his nuclear or missile programs but vowed to continue his policy of pursuing a nuclear arsenal and economic development simultaneously.""Our revolutionary armed forces are ready to fight any form of war the American imperialists want,"" he said, while the only prominent foreign guest -- Liu Yunshan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Politburo -- stood nearby.Mr. Liu is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the North since Mr. Kim rose to power in late 2011. President Xi Jinping of China also sent a warm note to Mr. Kim, a sign that relations may be thawing after a deep chill.In the message, widely reported by the Chinese state media, Mr. Xi said he not only extended the congratulations of the Chinese Communist Party but sent his own personal good wishes. He hailed Mr. Kim for having achieved ""positive progress in developing the economy, improving livelihoods, and so on.""China is the isolated North's only major ally, and Mr. Xi had seemed to establish a new distance between the countries soon after taking power in late 2012. He said that no country should be allowed to destabilize the Asian region or the world for ""selfish gain,"" a statement that was interpreted as a criticism of Mr. Kim's nuclear weapons program.China has signed on to United Nations sanctions meant to punish North Korea for its nuclear weapons program, and Mr. Kim was absent from China's military parade in Beijing last month.Despite its concerns about the North's nuclear program, China has not used its full economic leverage to discourage the North from pursuing it, apparently being more concerned about potential instability in the North that could spill into its territory. China's economic largess keeps North Korea's bare-bones economy afloat, but a debate has been roiling in the past year among Chinese military officials and academics over whether its ally is more a liability than an asset. China has also been expanding its ties to South Korea.A Chinese expert on North Korea, Yang Xiyu, said the tone of Mr. Xi's letter to Mr. Kim was fairly standard.The wording is ""always the same no matter whether the bilateral relationship is in good shape or bad shape,"" said Mr. Yang, a senior fellow at the China Institute of International Studies.But John Delury, an associate professor of international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, said Mr. Xi seemed to have used the occasion to mend fences with the North, at least to a degree.""Xi's letter marks the Chinese leader's first real effort to make friends with Kim Jong-un,"" Mr. Delury said. ""The fulsome praise of the Kim dynasty is new for Xi, whose administration has sounded guarded, even irritated, in its language toward Pyongyang.""Mr. Delury noted that Mr. Xi's letter did not mention denuclearization, in contrast with an earlier message carried by Vice President Li Yuanchao, who in 2013 tried to press North Korea to slow down its nuclear program.Mr. Xi's failure to mention denuclearization will disappoint those in Washington who believed that Beijing was coming around to their hard-line stance toward Mr. Kim, Mr. Delury said.The North's state-run Korean Central Television showed columns of tanks, drones and rocket tubes. South Korean officials said that the tubes included a new model with a range long enough to strike South Korean and American military bases south of Seoul. The highlight was what South Korean officials said appeared to be a new version of KN-08 long-range missiles.The KN-08 is widely believed to have been designed as the North's first intercontinental ballistic missile. But it has never been flight-tested, so when it was first shown in public in 2012 and 2013, some outside analysts said it might be a mock-up of a system still under development.",1.0
"NATO, Tested by Russia in Syria, Raises Its Guard and Its Tone:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BRUSSELS -- Confronted with its biggest military challenge since the end of the Cold War, a weakened NATO took steps Thursday to shore up its flanks, both in the Middle East and Europe, as Russia continued to test the credibility of the alliance's bedrock principle of collective defense.Western officials have been alarmed by the speed and scale of Moscow's intervention in Syria. Russia's warplanes have violated Turkish airspace -- deliberately so, NATO officials have said -- and its warships in the Caspian Sea have fired cruise missiles at targets in Syria -- though several seemed to have fallen short of their mark, landing somewhere in Iran, a senior American defense official said on Thursday.Not wanting to inflame the situation, but also wary of appearing too passive, Western officials have responded cautiously, taking a number of limited steps while raising the rhetorical heat on Moscow.On Thursday they said they had stepped up military exercises and deployed a small number of logistics personnel in Eastern and Central Europe. Britain announced that it would send soldiers to the Baltic countries, Poland and Ukraine after the show of force by Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin. Germany condemned Russia's operations in Syria in unusually pointed terms.""We are implementing the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the Cold War,"" NATO's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said before a meeting of defense ministers here on Thursday. After the meeting, he said, ""All of this sends a message to NATO citizens: NATO will defend you, NATO is on the ground, NATO is ready.""NATO has stationed Patriot batteries in Turkey to protect it from missiles emanating from Syria, but those had been scheduled to be removed this year. NATO officials have been discussing whether to keep the batteries in Turkey, given Russia's actions, but Mr. Stoltenberg played down that possibility.British officials said that units of up to 150 personnel would be regularly deployed to the Baltic countries, Poland and Ukraine to support military training. The Defense Ministry said it was sending 25 more British personnel to provide ""infantry, medical and survival skills"" to Ukrainian troops. The additional British personnel raises the number there to 100 from 75.Michael Fallon, the British defense secretary, called the decision part of a ""policy of persistent presence and aid for our allies on the eastern flank of NATO in response to Russian aggression and provocation.""The NATO moves announced Thursday were mostly symbolic, although Russia quickly reacted to the British announcement. Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for Mr. Putin, told journalists that any increased presence of British troops in Eastern Europe would be regrettable, according to Agence France-Presse, adding that it would amount to Britain's using an alleged Russian threat as camouflage to press ahead with NATO expansion. Russia, he said, would respond with ""parity.""As Western defense ministers -- including the United States defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter -- met here on Thursday, much of the discussion focused on Russia and Syria, and in particular the timing of the launch of 26 cruise missiles across more than 900 miles, from the Caspian Sea, into Syria.""They did this the day before a meeting of NATO defense ministers,"" one NATO official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the negotiations. ""Obviously, that is a message, but who can say what Putin is thinking.""But even as the alliance sought to project its power toward the Russian border, and to remind Moscow that Russian maneuvers in Turkish airspace could invite a response, several NATO officials expressed frustration that they did not see a clear path out of the increasingly complicated tangle that has become NATO's relationship with Russia. One said that the expansion of NATO toward Russia's borders was the reason Mr. Putin was now maneuvering for elbow room, both in Eastern Europe and in trying to retain his access to the Mediterranean Sea through Syria.Mr. Putin insists that Russia's intervention in Syria and its support for a ground offensive there -- which appeared to be an effort involving Iran, the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and the pro-government army, which is loyal to Syria's embattled president, Bashar al-Assad -- is intended to target militants from the Islamic State. But Western officials say he is using that pretext to batter other insurgent groups that have been trying to overthrow Mr. Assad.""The Russians are not mainly targeting ISIS, but they are targeting other opposition groups and they are supporting the regime,"" Mr. Stoltenberg said. ""And I call on Russia to play a constructive and cooperative role in the fight against ISIS, not to continue to support the Assad regime. Because to support the regime is not a constructive contribution to a peaceful and lasting political solution in Syria.""Bloomberg News quoted the German defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, as saying, ""When Russia attacks those who are fighting the Islamic State, that strengthens the Islamic State.""NATO announced that it was stepping up military exercises and establishing two small military headquarters, in Hungary and Slovakia, supplementing six others -- in the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and in Bulgaria, Poland and Romania. Each headquarters has about 80 military personnel, about half from the host state and the rest from NATO, according to officials at the alliance in Brussels. These officials said the headquarters mainly served as hubs for planning for potential reinforcement by NATO forces and assessing logistics, like the depths of ports or the lengths of runways.The alliance has taken steps since the Russian incursion into Crimea and Ukraine to build up a rapid reaction force in the Baltic states. While not stationing large numbers of troops in the region, it has stockpiled equipment, including 1,200 armored vehicles and 250 Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles that could be quickly deployed, officials have said.Meeting separately in Luxembourg, European Union interior ministers on Thursday were seeking to address the region's migration crisis that has been prompted in part by the Syrian conflict.The ministers were discussing a common rule book for expelling migrants ineligible for asylum; ways to fortify the European Union's external borders; and a list of safe countries where migrants can be returned.The ministers' conclusions are likely to be discussed at a summit meeting of European Union leaders on Oct. 15 and 16, when the issue of migration will top the agenda.Arriving at the meeting in Luxembourg, Theresa May, the British home secretary, called for urgent measures to dissuade migrants unlikely to qualify for asylum from going on dangerous journeys to Europe.""We should be sending economic migrants back to their countries of origin,"" Ms. May told reporters. ""On returns, we need to see Europe upping its game.""Jean Asselborn, the foreign minister of Luxembourg who is leading the meeting, told reporters, ""The control of external borders, immigration generally and also returns -- it's a package.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Photograph Debris From What Activists in Syria Said Was an Attack by the Russian Air Force On Wednesday in the Countryside of Idlib Province.

"Off the Coast of Iran, a High-Stakes Version of Spy Versus Spy:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"MANAMA, Bahrain -- The commander of the Navy's Fifth Fleet was in his office on the afternoon of July 25 when he got the phone call: An Iranian Navy frigate in the Gulf of Aden had approached a ship where an American military helicopter had just landed.Crew members on the Iranian ship pointed a heavy machine gun at the American helicopter, an alarming provocation at a time when critics are trying to kill a nuclear deal limiting Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The American helicopter, following standing orders to defuse tensions instead of elevating them, took off from the ship, but the Iranian crew continued to track it with the gun for a few moments before turning away.Then the report took a strange turn. During the entire episode, Vice Adm. John W. Miller, the Fifth Fleet commander, was told that an Iranian film crew aboard the frigate was videotaping everything. ""The whole thing took a couple of minutes,"" Admiral Miller said later, recounting his surprise at the film crew. ""We have no idea why they were filming it.""But wait, how did the Navy know the Iranians were filming the episode?Admiral Miller burst out laughing. ""Well, because we were filming them,"" he said. ""We have our video of their video.""In the crystalline waters of the Arabian Sea, it is spy versus spy between the United States and Iran. Ever since the United States, Iran and other world powers signed a pact to rein in Tehran's nuclear ambitions, skeptics of the deal -- which is subject to congressional approval -- have feared that the United States and Iran, longstanding regional adversaries, might let up on decades of vigilance.But in the skies and waters of the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden, the two continue to constantly watch each other. American naval ships openly roam the waters along Iran's 1,100-mile-long southern coastline, their radar trained on the Iranian shore and on Iranian ships leaving their harbors. Iranian fighter jets patrol the skies, keeping an eye on American combat planes that take off from an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf every time an Iranian jet comes close to their ship.""It's a little bit of a game we play,"" said Capt. Benjamin Hewlett, the commander of the air wing aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, which is in the Persian Gulf keeping an eye on Iran right now. ""When they launch, we launch. We consider this our sovereign territory, so we make sure they're not unescorted in and around the aircraft carrier.""Sometimes it seems like a game of chicken -- only with risks so high that a single misstep could unravel what has been a tenuous standoff between the United States and Iran for 36 years.But for the Obama administration, the American naval presence off Iranian shores is now more important than ever as the administration seeks to assure Middle Eastern allies and a skeptical Congress that the United States will continue to keep an eye on Iran.Aboard the Theodore Roosevelt, a steady stream of military officials from the region have arrived to see the situation for themselves. A few weeks ago the Saudi defense minister, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, got a standard tour of the flight deck and viewings of fighter jets screaming into the air, but Navy officials also took him into the combat direction center, a classified room deep in the carrier where operations specialists track Iran using an array of high-tech equipment.Officers on the Roosevelt said there was less Iranian activity in the gulf in the weeks leading up to the conclusion of the nuclear deal in July, but all the officers said the slowdown was most likely because of Ramadan. After the deal was signed -- and Ramadan ended -- the officers said Iranian activity in the gulf picked up as Iran deployed more warships off the Iranian coast and increased its fighter jet flights.""I don't think things are any different now than they were before"" the nuclear pact was signed, Rear Adm. Roy Kelley, the commander of the strike group aboard the Theodore Roosevelt, said in an interview on the ship's bridge. ""We have interactions every day with Iran. Fifty percent of the Persian Gulf coastline is Iran, so when they see us here, they come and check us out.""He added that ""for the most part, they're professional.""A few minutes later, an announcement sounded throughout the aircraft carrier: ""Gun Quarters....Set Conditions Thunder"" -- something unknown was nearing the carrier, which, Captain Hewlett said, usually means an Iranian ship or aircraft.It was in fact an Iranian ship, but it did not get close, and soon there was the all clear.The constant watchfulness can make for heightened nerves. In April, just two days after the Roosevelt arrived in the Persian Gulf to relieve the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson, military officials ordered the ship to turn around and head to the waters off the coast of Yemen to block an Iranian convoy suspected of transporting weapons to Houthi fighters there. The Roosevelt, escorted by the guided missile cruiser Normandy, was soon passing through the Strait of Hormuz into the Arabian Sea and then south to the Arabian Peninsula.On board, sailors realized that the world was watching to see who would blink first. ""Us arriving and then turning around so soon was unusual,"" said Cmdr. Andrew Strickland, the head of the Combat Direction Center on the Roosevelt. In the combat center, where much of the time is spent watching Iran, suddenly tactical officers were watching themselves -- on television news reports about the drama unfolding as the Roosevelt moved to block the Iranian convoy. ""It was definitely weird to suddenly be seeing your own ship on CNN,"" said Lt. William Thomas, a tactical action officer who works in the combat center.For the Obama administration, it was important to signal to skeptics that even though the United States was in the final stages of negotiating the nuclear deal with Iran, the administration would continue to back its regional allies against Iran -- particularly Saudi Arabia, which was in the middle of a bombing campaign against the Houthis in Yemen that Saudi officials said was necessary to try to restore the ousted American-backed Yemeni government.Things on the ship ""were a little more tense,"" Captain Hewlett said. ""It's a big political message for our country to send to their country.""At the time, one Pentagon official compared the decision to deploy an aircraft carrier to turn around a weapons convoy as similar to deploying a nuclear weapon to kill an ant.To the surprise of almost no one, the Iranian convoy, within two days of the arrival of the Roosevelt, turned around and headed back toward Iran.Photograph On the Flight Deck of the Carrier Theodore Roosevelt After a Mission.

U.S.-Led Strike in Syria Is Tied to Civilian Deaths:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ANTAKYA, Turkey -- An airstrike by the American-led military coalition in northern Syria this week killed eight civilians, including two women and five children, according to neighbors and relatives of the dead.The episode revived accusations by monitoring groups that the United States and its allies are not careful enough about who is killed by the air campaign against militant groups.The target of the strike, mounted late Tuesday in Atmeh, a village near the Turkish border, was a munitions factory run by an Islamist rebel group. The strike left a yawning crater strewed with mortar shells. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said 10 foreign fighters had been killed.But the explosions also caused the roofs of nearby homes to collapse, witnesses said.""My brother lost his five daughters, and I lost my wife,"" Maan Amouri said in a telephone interview from Atmeh soon after the blast, referring to his fiancée, Fatima Yassin, who was among the dead.Monitoring groups say the United States and its allies regularly underreport the civilian toll of the air campaign.The deaths in Atmeh may dent the credibility of the United States among Syria's rebel groups, when the Obama administration is trying to assemble and train an insurgent force that can grapple effectively with the extremists of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.The episode highlighted the complex social dynamics in rebel-controlled areas of Syria, where armed groups often operate in civilian communities and sometimes provide services that are sorely lacking after more than four years of war.The American-led coalition began bombing in Syria in September 2014 after the Islamic State seized large stretches of territory. Since then, the coalition has mounted 2,300 strikes in Syria, most of them against the Islamic State, but in some cases against the Nusra Front, the Syrian affiliate of Al Qaeda, or against prominent jihadist leaders.American officials say they strive to avoid civilian casualties and investigate all reports of wrongful deaths.In an email on Thursday, the United States Central Command said it had received reports of 31 such episodes since the air campaign began and had dismissed 17 of them as not credible. Six episodes are currently being investigated, the command said.The command has released its findings concerning two of the 31 reports. One was found not credible. The other was investigated for more than six months and led to a conclusion that two children had probably been killed wrongfully by a coalition airstrike.Monitoring groups say that the command's figures are a gross understatement and that coalition strikes aimed at militants have taken a much higher toll.""They do not hit civilians because they are civilians,"" said Ossama Suleiman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks the conflict from Britain through contacts in Syria. ""They have info that makes them think they are hitting ISIS, but sometimes they kill civilians.""By his organization's reckoning, 181 civilians have died because of coalition strikes, including eight in Atmeh. Other groups have reported higher estimates.The deadliest case reported by the observatory happened in the village of Bir Mahle on May 1, where an airstrike was said to have killed more than 60 people, including dozens of women and children.A coalition representative said in an email that the coalition did not cause civilian casualties in this case ""based on the best available evidence.""Other strikes have killed civilians living or working near facilities used by the Islamic State or the Nusra Front, Mr. Suleiman said, including militant hide-outs, grain silos, oil facilities and fuel depots. At least one strike that killed a militant also killed his wife and children.Analysts caution that documenting death tolls poses challenges, especially in a place like Syria, where the war's brutality and the spread of extremist groups make it difficult or impossible for journalists and independent monitors to visit the sites of attacks or contact witnesses.Moreover, local residents sometimes exaggerate the number of victims or conceal the presence of foreign fighters in the area.""Some of the reports of fatalities caused by the U.S. have proven to be inaccurate, so I would treat the reports with a good deal of skepticism,"" said Lama Fakih, senior crisis adviser at Amnesty International.Ms. Fakih said that coalition strikes tend to hit their targets accurately, but that some have nonetheless killed civilians who were near the military targets. She called on the coalition to make more information available about how it selects targets and weighs their military importance against the risk to civilians. When civilians are harmed, she said, the coalition should make sure that they or their families receive compensation.The strike in Atmeh on Tuesday illustrated the close ties between rebels and civilians.The strike destroyed a weapons workshop that belonged to a group called the Sunna Army, part of an Islamist coalition that includes the Nusra Front and is fighting the forces of Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad. Civilian homes were close to the workshop, on land owned by Mustafa Amouri, who was known earlier in the uprising for offering hospitality to aid workers and journalists who entered Syria clandestinely from Turkey. Reporters for The New York Times met his family a number of times.As Syria's conflict escalated from a popular uprising to a civil war, jihadists came to greatly outnumber journalists among the people reaching Atmeh from Turkey, and the Amouri family built ties with Islamist groups who were smuggling fighters and supplies through the village.Musab Kadour, who lives nearby, said Mr. Amouri rented land to the Sunna Army to build the workshop. One of Mr. Amouri's sons, Muawiya, lived near the factory, and five of his daughters were killed when the blast collapsed the roof of his house, Mr. Kadour said. He added that they ranged in age from 4 to 10. He provided photos of the dead children taken before they were buried.A family that had fled fighting farther south in Syria was also killed: Qutaifa Yassin; her son, Yousif; and her daughter Fatima, who was engaged to Maan Amouri.The United States Central Command confirmed in an email message that the coalition had conducted an airstrike in the area of Atmeh, but did not specify the target. It said it was looking into reports of civilian casualties there.",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; North Korea: Dispute Over Land Mines:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea denied on Friday planting land mines that maimed two South Korean soldiers near their guard post last week.Three land mines that the South said were manufactured by North Korea exploded on Aug. 4 when the two soldiers stepped on them just outside their post inside the South Korean half of the 2.5-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone, a buffer separating large contingents of the two countries' armies. One soldier lost both legs and the other one leg in the blasts.On Monday, the South and the American-led United Nations Command said a joint investigation had concluded that the mines had been planted by North Korean troops. As evidence, they presented the debris of wooden-box land mines used by the North Korean military.On Friday, the North called those findings ""nonsense"" and accused South Korea of using stray North Korean mines it had collected from the buffer zone to fabricate the incident in an attempt to drive up military tension. It challenged the South to provide more persuasive evidence, such as video footage, that the mines had been planted by North Korea.""If the same mines had exploded in the heart of Seoul, are they still going to insist that our troops went and planted them there?"" a North Korean spokesman was quoted as saying by the North's official Korean Central News Agency.The South Korean military said Friday that the North's military had sent a similar denial across the border by telephone. The South, as it had earlier, vowed ""severe retaliation.""The mine explosions worsened already chilly relations between the two Koreas.As part of its initial response, the South turned on its battery of loudspeakers on the border with the North for the first time in 11 years, blaring propaganda broadcasts that included harsh criticism of the North Korean government. On Friday, activists in the South released balloons carrying propaganda leaflets across the border. The balloons also carried a large banner that called the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, ""a bloodthirsty murderer"" and ""human trash.""For its part, state-run television in the North this week showed North Korean soldiers shooting at an image of the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, with pistols and rifles. The North also warned that it was ready to attack the White House in Washington and the Blue House, the presidential office in Seoul, saying that a joint South Korean-American military exercise scheduled to begin next week was bringing the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
"Despite Truce, Shelling Continues in Parts of Ukraine:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"LUHANSKOYE, Ukraine -- The first day of a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine was marred by deadly artillery fire on Sunday, and both the Ukrainian military and Russian-backed separatists accused each other of violating the new accord.Some lingering violence was expected, given the recent intensity of the combat, yet over all, Ukrainian officials said, the accord reached last week was holding.A lull after the midnight cease-fire deadline, however, was followed Sunday morning by a resumption of shelling near the disputed town of Debaltseve, where the fate of about 8,000 Ukrainian soldiers remained unresolved in the negotiations leading to the cease-fire.By midday, shells and rockets were flying in both directions over the front line about nine miles north of the besieged town.The separatists had violated the cease-fire 10 times at various locations, a Ukrainian military spokesman, Anatoliy Stelmakh, said in a statement on Sunday. A local official said two people had died in shelling.The separatists said the Ukrainian Army had opened fire and their forces had little choice but to respond, a rebel news agency, DAN, quoted Eduard Basurin, the military spokesman for the Donetsk People's Republic, as saying. ""Units were forced to open fire in response,"" Mr. Basurin said.The clashes focused, as they have for weeks, on Ukraine's fragile, attenuated and possibly severed supply route into Debaltseve.A rebel leader had warned on Saturday that the accord would not apply to that area, if the Ukrainian Army tried to break out of what he said was an encirclement. The Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, has denied that Debaltseve is surrounded.The argument hinges on one section of road stretching about nine miles from this village, Luhanskoye, into Debaltseve. It is heavily mined and within range of both armies' artillery, meaning that neither side can travel it and that neither the separatists nor Kiev can claim undisputed control over it. If Ukraine cannot evacuate or resupply the thousands of soldiers there, the casualties, from artillery barrages, and the eventual surrender of the survivors, could tip the outcome of the war, and quite likely destabilize Ukrainian domestic politics. Mr. Poroshenko has said he may ask Parliament to declare martial law.A dozen or so soldiers, filthy, bearded and wide-eyed, turned up on Sunday at a hospital in Ukrainian-held territory after escaping from the town. They said that comrades in another truck had been blown up by a separatist missile.They were the first known people to have left Debaltseve since Thursday, though their exit seemed to shed no light on the dispute over the openness of the road.After unloading three wounded colleagues and a body, one of the soldiers, who offered only his first name, Viktor, slumped in a hospital corridor and said, ""We got out only because we were lucky.""Soldiers on the supply route have said for days that it was impassable, contrary to the senior leadership's claims. From the last Ukrainian checkpoint here in Luhanskoye, the road stretched off into the mist Sunday morning, cratered and vacant, with nothing moving in either direction. ""You should leave here as quickly as you can,"" a twitchy Ukrainian soldier said. ""This road is closed.""Kommersant, an influential Russian newspaper, reported over the weekend that eight of the 16 hours of cease-fire talks involving the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine in Minsk, Belarus, last week circled around the fate of Debaltseve.""Almost half of the time was spent discussing the Debaltseve kettle,"" wrote the newspaper's Kremlin reporter, Andrey Kolesnikov, using the Russian term for a military encirclement.""Above all, does it exist or not?"" he wrote. ""Vladimir Putin insisted that it exists and that if a cease-fire agreement is reached, it will be odd if it isn't violated: Those in the kettle will certainly try to get out of there; those who have boiled that kettle will try to collect the foam.""Over the weekend, President Obama spoke by telephone with Mr. Poroshenko and expressed ""grave concern"" about the Debaltseve problem. Mr. Obama also spoke with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.President François Hollande of France and Ms. Merkel also spoke by phone to Mr. Poroshenko and the Russian president, Mr. Putin, about the truce, according to a statement issued by Mr. Hollande's office.On the first day of the cease-fire, many people began stirring from bunkers and basements and assessing the damage.In Luhanskoye, soldiers stood outside, smoking against a backdrop of destruction -- discarded ammunition boxes, broken tree limbs and shattered glass. Not a single house had its windows intact.Illustrating how poorly the army was equipped, one soldier was using the lull to repair a battery for his armored personnel carrier, saying he had no spare.Kneeling in a muddy street, he melted a piece of plastic with a cigarette lighter and allowed the blobs to plug a leak in the wall of the battery.A lone pedestrian picked his way through craters on a street, carrying a bag of bread that he said he would feed to his chickens that had not been cared for since Thursday. He was not sure how many had made it. ""It's not a big deal,"" he said. ""But I do want to keep them.""Despite the continued shelling, some residents in these front-line villages said they were focused on the benefits the deal had already brought.Aleksei V. Kravchenko, 73, a retiree in Svitlodarsk, watched plumbers repair a water pipe burst in an artillery strike on Saturday, before the cease-fire took effect.He said he wanted to thank Ms. Merkel for negotiating the truce, despite its limitations, on behalf of his grandchildren. Mr. Kravchenko had built a bomb shelter in his basement and had spent nights with the children during the shelling.""They would say, 'Grandpa, I don't want to die young,' and I held them, and they were shaking, and I looked in their eyes, and they were afraid,"" he said. ""Now we are hoping.""Photograph Ukrainian Soldiers Playing Sunday On a Road in Svitlodarsk, Approaching the Disputed Town of Debaltseve. Shelling Resumed in Some Areas Sunday.

"Agreement Calls for Release of Pilot Held in Moscow, Ukrainian President Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"MOSCOW -- Of the hundreds of prisoners of war captured during the nearly yearlong fighting in eastern Ukraine, only one was mentioned by name on the agenda of world leaders at peace talks in Minsk, Belarus: Nadiya V. Savchenko, a former lieutenant in the Ukrainian military, helicopter navigator and graduate of Ukraine's Air Force Academy.Ms. Savchenko, 33, is not being held in eastern Ukraine by Russian-backed separatists. She is in a Moscow prison, charged by Russia in connection with the deaths of two Russian journalists who were killed in a mortar strike in Ukraine in June while covering a war that the Kremlin has long insisted does not involve Russia or its military.As the leaders in Minsk announced on Thursday that they had reached a broad agreement for a cease-fire and weapons pullback in eastern Ukraine, there was also a proviso for Ms. Savchenko's release. President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine, for whom winning the pilot's freedom had become a priority, announced the condition at a news conference and said there was an understanding that she would be freed.How Ms. Savchenko ended up in a Russian jail, facing charges by the Investigative Committee, the main national criminal investigations agency in Russia, is disputed.When she first surfaced in Russia, she was being held at a prison in Voronezh, near the Ukrainian border. Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Investigative Committee, claimed she had crossed voluntarily into Russia.""It turned out that she crossed the Russian border without documents, posing as a refugee,"" Mr. Markin said. He added that Ms. Savchenko had been detained during a routine check of documents by the authorities.The Ukrainian government said, however, that Ms. Savchenko had been captured by rebel forces and transported to Russia.Nikolai Polozov, one of Ms. Savchenko's lawyers, said that his client had participated in the protests in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, last year that ousted the country's president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, and that she had helped carry medicine to protesters wounded by gunfire.As war broke out in eastern Ukraine, Ms. Savchenko took leave several times from the army to travel to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Mr. Polozov said. On the morning the two Russian journalists were killed, Mr. Polozov said, Ms. Savchenko was wounded in an artillery fight nearby, and she and several others were captured. He said cellphone records proved that she was caught at least 30 minutes before the mortar fire that killed the journalists.He said Ms. Savchenko had been held for two weeks in a gymnasium in Luhansk before being taken across the border and turned over to the Russian authorities.Even before the war, Ms. Savchenko was a national hero for being one of Ukraine's first female combat pilots, and was the subject of a documentary. She had combat experience in Iraq, where she served as a paratrooper with a Ukrainian contingent supporting the American-led war effort, and used that experience to pressure the Ukrainian military into admitting her to the Ivan Kozhedub Air Force University in Kharkiv for pilot training.She has been similarly steel-willed in prison. She has been on a hunger strike in recent weeks and has repeatedly castigated the Russian government for her detention, at times insisting on speaking only Ukrainian in court.At one hearing, she used a speaking opportunity to address the television cameras more than the judge. ""I'm tired of Russia's lies, your deceitful judges and your dishonest media,"" she said.Since her detention, she has been elected to the Ukrainian Parliament as a member of the Fatherland party, led by former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko. Last month, other lawmakers from the party wore T-shirts in Parliament that read, ""Free Nadiya Savchenko.""As a result of the cease-fire agreement in Minsk, it seems that they might get their wish. Mr. Poroshenko said at the news conference that there was a provision for all prisoners of war to be set free.Aleksei K. Pushkov, a prominent Russian lawmaker, cautioned that Ms. Savchenko's release was not a foregone conclusion.""There is no automatic mechanism to free a person accused of being accomplice to murder, in this case of a Russian journalist,"" Mr. Pushkov said, Russian news agencies reported.As of Thursday afternoon, there was no indication of Ms. Savchenko's release, Mark Feygin, another lawyer for Ms. Savchenko, said by telephone. ""As long as Putin or someone trusted by him does not confirm this information, we can only speak about it theoretically,"" he said.Photograph Nadiya V. Savchenko at a Moscow Court On Tuesday.

Indian and Pakistani Guards Trade Fire on Disputed Border:   [Foreign Desk ],,"NEW DELHI -- Indian and Pakistani border guards exchanged fire along the disputed northern border in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, leaving at least two people dead and at least one other wounded, officials said Saturday.Each side accused the other of breaking a cease-fire.A Pakistani military official said a 13-year-old girl had been killed by ""unprovoked firing"" from Indian border posts near the city of Sialkot. An 8-year-old was wounded in another district, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in accordance with protocol.Indian officials said Pakistani rangers ""kept on firing the whole night,"" using mortars and machine guns against 15 posts manned by India's Border Security Force.One woman was killed in the Samba district, said Rakesh Sharma, chief of the Indian forces in the Jammu region.Mr. Sharma said that the exchange of fire had been lighter during the day on Saturday, ""an odd shell left and right,"" but that residents were beginning to leave their homes in anticipation of heavier nighttime firing.Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir, and the neighbors have fought two wars over the region.For years, cross-border exchanges of fire have occasionally erupted, but in recent months, episodes of heavier shelling have prompted thousands of families in villages near the border to flee in search of safety.",1.0
"India: Pakistani Boat Explodes When Stopped at Sea, Officials Say:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"NEW DELHI -- India said on Friday that its coast guard had intercepted a suspicious Pakistan-based fishing boat at sea late on New Year's Eve, but that when Indian officers approached the vessel to investigate, four men aboard the boat set off an ""explosion and major fire"" that completely destroyed the vessel.Pakistani officials said they believed that the Indian report was a hoax, though they were still trying to investigate the matter.The Indian Defense Ministry said security forces had received repeated warnings of a ""threat from the sea,"" and had increased their maritime patrols in recent months. The ministry said that Indian officials received intelligence on Wednesday night that a fishing boat ""was planning some illicit transaction in the Arabian Sea.""A coast guard patrol ship located the vessel around midnight and attempted to stop it from fleeing by firing warning shots, the Defense Ministry said in a statement.Four men who were seen aboard the vessel refused to cooperate, and then ""hid themselves in a below-deck compartment and set the boat on fire,"" the statement said. The boat burned and sank in the early hours of New Year's Day, and darkness and strong winds prevented the coast guard vessel from recovering its remains, the statement said.Indian officials did not say what they thought the four men's intentions were.Terrorists have entered India by sea in the past. The heavily armed gunmen who mounted coordinated attacks in Mumbai in 2008, which left 166 people dead including six Americans, traveled by boat from Pakistan.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
