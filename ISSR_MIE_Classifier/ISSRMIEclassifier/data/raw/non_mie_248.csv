Assault in Mali Reverses Gains on Extremism:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. BAMAKO, Mali -- The terrorists chose carefully: There are nearly always French, Russian and even a few American visitors to be found in the hotel restaurant, around the pool, in the health club or on the thin black-leather sofas of the glass-fronted lobby, now shattered by gunfire.With its marble floors, open atrium and lipstick-red lounge, the Radisson Blu Hotel served as a lifeline to the world, a gathering place where diplomats, contractors and others doing business in Mali, one of the poorest countries on earth, could all be found.Now, bullet holes pockmark the walls and blood is pooled on stairs. The hotel, once a symbol of the international presence in a country trying to emerge from years of upheaval, is the site of a massacre in which terrorists killed 19 people, storming in at breakfast on Friday as terrified diners sprinted into an elevator whose doors did not close in time to save them.""For those people who did this, they have no sense of the value of life,"" President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta said at the foot of the ransacked hotel on Saturday afternoon.The brutal attacks in Paris this month were a strike against France's joie de vivre. The siege of Kenya's gleaming Westgate mall two years ago was an assault on that country's rising prosperity, modernity and stability. The terrifying attack on the Radisson Blu here in Mali's capital was a strike on this nation's fragile efforts to restore peace after years of fighting.But in all of these places, the same fundamental question applies: How does a democratic society protect itself from a few determined extremists who can upend an entire nation with a single devastating strike?""Nobody has found the way to really kick-start a multidimensional approach to countering radicalism,"" said Jean-Herve Jezequel, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.Even in Iraq and Afghanistan, where thousands of lives and billions of dollars have been spent trying to wrest those countries from chaos, extremist forces are flourishing.It is a lesson that Mali knows only too well.Before the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, swept across wide stretches of Syria and Iraq, establishing a self-proclaimed caliphate, black flags flew in Mali.After a rebellion and military coup plunged the country into disarray, jihadists from across the Sahel charged through northern Mali. They abducted girls and raped them, imposed their harsh version of Islam on the towns they took over, carried out summary executions and destroyed ancient Sufi shrines. They drove out tens of thousands of Malians from their homes, and ruled the northern half of the country for months in 2012 while the rest of the country could do little more than watch.Unlike in Syria, the West did not sit on the sidelines while the country disintegrated. France, the former colonial power, put hundreds of boots on the ground, chasing out the extremists from the towns they controlled, scattering them to the desert and killing some of their top leaders, while the United Nations took on the job of working out a peace deal between the government and the rebels.There are close to 10,000 peacekeepers still in Mali, along with drones that hover over the region. And yet, even after elections and a peace deal to set the country on a new course, extremists have carried out multiple terrorist attacks this year against civilian targets like a restaurant and another hotel, shaking the nation's faith.""It means that we're not over it yet,"" said Karim Keïta, the president's son and the head of Mali's commission of national defense. ""We had a terrorist past, but we're not over it.""Witnesses described how easy it was for the gunmen to carry out the attack on the Radisson Blu on Friday, for which militants linked with Al Qaeda claimed responsibility.Across the street from the hotel, Ibrahim Maiga was in his apartment over his small corner store when he noticed something odd outside his window: a man fishing a few things out of a suitcase that he had opened on the ground.The man pulled out a grenade, a gun and some other items that Mr. Maiga could not make out. The man then picked up the gun and fired it into the air before walking toward two security guards outside the hotel. He shot one, crossed the road, then shot the other. Both of the men collapsed, Mr. Maiga said. One of them, a friend of Mr. Maiga's, later died.Hotel guests were at breakfast around 7 a.m. on the mezzanine level of the hotel when the shots first rang out.""We heard shooting, pa-pa-pa, from Kalashnikov,"" said Ali Yazbeck, 30, the assistant patisserie chef on duty. The head chef shouted that there was an attack, he said. Guests and staff members fled together from the dining room through the kitchen, to a staff elevator at the back of the building.""The lift takes eight, but there were many more than that,"" Mr. Yazbeck recounted from his hospital bed. ""The doors would not close.""A gunman appeared and opened fire. Mr. Yazbeck, a slim man with glasses, was the first to fall, shot in the neck. He prayed silently as the gunman turned to the open elevator and gunned down everyone inside. They were hotel guests, Mr. Yazbeck said: French, Chinese, among others.Within minutes, the killer returned. For a second time, Mr. Yazbeck feigned death. ""I felt shots brushing by my head,"" he said. The gunman leaned close and lightly brushed Mr. Yazbeck's lips with his hand, apparently checking to see if he were still alive. Then he left.Mr. Yazbeck said he stayed frozen in fear in his hiding place for hours, listening to gunfire and explosions reverberate through the hotel, until security forces eventually rescued him and others around 3 p.m.The gunmen -- Mr. Yazbeck said he saw two in all -- were young, 20 or 21, he estimated, and appeared calm. They wore baseball caps. The first was dark-skinned and had a black turban around his neck, he said. The second was lighter skinned. They made no comment or explanation for what they were doing.The first gunman was laughing when he opened fire on the foreign guests, Mr. Yazbeck said. At one point, the second gunman came into the kitchen and calmly took some meat from the fridge, grilled it and ate it during a break in the killing.They targeted foreigners and Malians equally, Mr. Yazbeck said, and did not hesitate to open fire on fellow Muslims (a statement that was at odds with other accounts). ""When he saw me, he just fired,"" he said. Three of the five hotel staff members on breakfast duty were killed, he said.During coups and countercoups, violent demonstrations and rebel incursions in the north, the Radisson Blu continued to operate, even when the guest count dwindled to a few rooms.The tally of those who died hereon Friday is a testament to the global hub the hotel had become: Among them were one American, two Belgians, six Russians and three Chinese. They included a development specialist, railroad construction executives, air cargo employees bringing in machinery, and a foreign government worker in the country for a conference on training Mali's civil servants.Still, even with hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and continued international engagement -- Mr. Keïta, Mali's president, was recently received with great pomp in Paris by the French president, with Malian flags adorning the Champs-Élysées -- Mali is as troubled as ever, according to analysts.A political solution for the fractured nation remains elusive, with jihadists rejecting it outright. ""Large swaths of territory"" remain ""devoid of state authority,"" leaving armed groups free to commit ""abuses with impunity,"" Human Rights Watch warned this year.""There are a lot of actors who continue to threaten,"" said Pierre Englebert, an expert on African politics at Pomona College. ""We are not far from where we were in 2012 in terms of state weakness.""For some, the attacks show the limitations of a military-driven approach to fighting terrorism, and how hard it is to find a solution that actually works.""It's been 3 years that French are eliminating some extremist leaders, with some success by the way,"" said Mr. Jezequel of the crisis group. ""But it does not solve the problem.""",0.0
The Mets Trade for a Star Outfielder After All:   [Sports Desk ],,"David Wright was conducting a group interview near his locker on Friday afternoon and the clock over his right shoulder read 3:53, seven minutes from the trade deadline. It was then that a reporter informed him that news was circulating that the Mets had acquired Yoenis Cespedes, the Cuban-born outfielder with the powerful bat and arm and the ability to electrify a crowd.A big smile spread across Wright's face.""We've been through this before,"" he said, still grinning, a knowing reference to the Mets' trade for Milwaukee center fielder Carlos Gomez that had fallen through just two days before.This time, though, there was no retreat. General Manager Sandy Alderson walked into a Citi Field news conference room a short while later to announce that the deal was official, making clear that the Mets, a team that has not been in the postseason since 2006 and has not even had a winning season since moving into its current stadium in 2009, is serious about contending right now.""We believe we're in position to compete through the rest of the season for a playoff spot,"" Alderson said, ""and we're going to do everything we can to ensure that competitive level.""The Mets made that point in a particularly emphatic way because the 29-year-old Cespedes is one of the game's more exciting players.Everything he does is energetic, from his violent swings to his bat flips, from his big throws to his bigger home runs. He has twice won the All-Star Game home run derby, including the one held in 2013 at Citi Field. He spent that night launching souvenirs around the upper deck in what could be an impressive foreshadowing of his first game in Queens, which should come on Saturday night.Cespedes defected to the United States from Cuba by speedboat in 2011, after a 23-hour voyage to the Dominican Republic. He did a workout there that was recorded and showed him hitting home runs, sprinting shirtless and lifting weights. The Oakland Athletics signed him for $36 million, in time for the 2012 season.He played well for the A's and went to the postseason with them twice, but last year he was dealt to Boston in the deal that sent Jon Lester to Oakland. In the off-season he was then traded to the Tigers in exchange for starting pitcher Rick Porcello.This season, he is batting .293, with 18 home runs and 61 runs batted in. He immediately becomes the Mets' best weapon on defense and arguably their best hitter, and his right-handed power in the middle of the order will be a useful counterbalance to the Mets' two other power hitters, Lucas Duda and Curtis Granderson, both of whom are left-handed.More than anything, he should add some oomph to the Mets' lineup. The Mets went into Friday's game having scored the fewest runs of any team in baseball.""This is the kind of player that can have a big impact both in terms of the game on the field and how the team is perceived,"" Alderson said.The Mets had originally pegged Gomez to bolster the Mets' lineup and would have sent Wilmer Flores and Zack Wheeler to the Brewers to acquire him. But that trade fell through, with differing theories as to why. Which left the Mets' front office to turn to other options as Friday's 4 p.m. trade deadline drew closer.Alderson and his deputies made calls and juggled proposals. Cincinnati outfielder Jay Bruce seemed to be an option, and then he was not. Finally, an agreement emerged with the Tigers.""I salute the front office,"" Manager Terry Collins said. ""I salute the ownership.""Over the past week, the Mets acquired four players -- Kelly Johnson, Juan Uribe, Tyler Clippard and Cespedes -- who added to their infield depth, fortified their bullpen and strengthened their offense. They did so without adding any significant money to a payroll that has become famously modest for a big-market team or trading away any of their young players in the major leagues.What the Mets did do to make their deals was dip into their impressive pitching depth in the minor leagues and trade away some players who may or may not turn out to be pretty good at some point in the future. Specifically, in the case of Cespedes, the Mets gave up two minor league right-handers, Luis Cessa and Michael Fulmer, who was a first-round draft pick in 2011 and has pitched impressively at Class AA this season.The price was not higher for Cespedes because he is essentially a two-month rental. He is making $10.5 million this year -- the Mets will not have to pay much of it -- and will become a free agent at season's end, when there is a good chance he will be in position to command a new multiyear deal worth tens of millions of dollars, the kind of money the Mets rarely spend these days.Cespedes also has an unusual clause in his contract that adds still more pressure on the Mets if they do try to sign him to a new deal.The clause stipulates that if his current team does not re-sign Cespedes within an exclusive five-day window at the end of the World Series, it cannot try again until the following May, which, for sure, would be too late. So, in effect, the Mets will have very little time to persuade Cespedes to stick around for a whole lot of money.Still, on Friday, Alderson saw no reason to rule out Cespedes's return in 2016.""If he plays well for us and enjoys New York, that's always a possibility,"" Alderson said.The Mets plan to play Cespedes in left field, his normal position, which could create a problem if, and when, Michael Cuddyer returns from the disabled list.At that point, Curtis Granderson could shift to center field and take time away from Juan Lagares.But for now, the Mets were simply happy to dwell on the present.Travis d'Arnaud returned to the lineup on Friday after about six weeks on the disabled list. Wright, who has not played in a game since April, went through another workout with positive results. And Cespedes was set to join the team this weekend.""Give him credit,"" Wright said of Alderson. ""He said he wanted to be aggressive. He said we're trying to win now. When you make moves, it backs that up.""Photograph Photo (Photograph by Chris O'meara/Associated Press) (D1); Yoenis Cespedes, Acquired by the Mets On Friday in a Trade with the Tigers, Is Batting .293 with 18 Home Runs and 61 R.B.I.

FIFA Issues Unexpected Ban of Its Former Vice President:   [Sports Desk ],,"In a largely symbolic move, FIFA, the international organization overseeing world soccer, announced Tuesday that it had barred Jack Warner, a former vice president who left the sport's leadership amid scandal four years ago.Mr. Warner, of Trinidad and Tobago, is among 14 men who were indicted by the United States in May on widespread corruption charges, including bribery and kickback schemes dating to 1991. The allegations against Mr. Warner have mounted this month; Swiss investigators announced last week that they were scrutinizing an element of Mr. Warner's record for which the United States had not charged him -- his purchase of valuable World Cup television rights from Sepp Blatter, FIFA's president, in 2005 for an amount potentially 33 times lower than market value. The deal ignited suspicions of a quid pro quo agreement.Still, the timing of FIFA's announcement Tuesday -- four months after Mr. Warner was charged and many of his peers were barred from soccer -- was unexpected. Years before, Mr. Warner had been under investigation by FIFA after he was suspected of offering bribes in exchange for election votes. In response, he resigned in 2011 from both FIFA and Concacaf, a regional confederation overseeing soccer in North and Central America and the Caribbean.In a statement, FIFA said its independent ethics committee had been examining the bidding contests for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups since January, months before the United States' case was announced. Those bidding contests, won by Russia and Qatar, are at the center of the Swiss inquiry.The FIFA ethics committee decided to bar Mr. Warner on Friday, the statement said, the same day that Swiss authorities announced their latest investigation into the World Cup contract potentially implicating Mr. Blatter.""Mr. Warner was found to have committed many and various acts of misconduct continuously and repeatedly during his time as an official in different high-ranking and influential positions,"" FIFA's statement said. ""He was a key player in schemes involving the offer, acceptance and receipt of undisclosed and illegal payments, as well as other moneymaking schemes.""Without further detail on the misconduct, FIFA -- which has undertaken its own internal inquiry, led by the law firm Quinn Emanuel, and is sharing information with authorities in the United States -- said Mr. Warner was found to have violated six articles of its code of ethics. He is forbidden to take part in any kind of organized soccer at the national and international level.Mr. Warner, 72, was characteristically defiant in response. He issued his own statement on his Facebook page in the wake of FIFA's announcement Tuesday.""I left the FIFA in April 2011 and if in September 2015 (some four years and five months after) the FIFA wants to ban me for life without even a hearing then so be it,"" it said. ""I do not believe, however, that this will serve as the distraction to the FIFA's present problems as the FIFA wishes it to be.""Indeed, the United States' case marches on: Six of Mr. Warner's fellow former FIFA officials sit in jail in Switzerland, and on Tuesday, Swiss authorities approved the third extradition this month, of Eduardo Li, the former president of the Costa Rican soccer federation. Mr. Li has 30 days to appeal that decision, which could take until spring 2016 to resolve in Swiss courts.In recent weeks, authorities have approved the extradition of Eugenio Figueredo, former head of Conmebol, the South American soccer confederation, and Rafael Esquivel, former head of the Venezuelan soccer federation. Both informed the Swiss Federal Office of Justice last week that they plan to appeal those decisions, the office confirmed Tuesday.Mr. Blatter is holding on to the FIFA presidency in the face of the Swiss investigation of him. On Monday, he addressed staff members in Zurich. According to his lawyer, Richard Cullen of McGuireWoods, Mr. Blatter ""informed the staff that he was cooperating with the authorities, reiterated that he had done nothing illegal or improper and stated that he would remain as president of FIFA.""",0.0
Vox and BuzzFeed Obtain Interviews With Obama:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"A pair of fast-growing digital media companies, Vox and BuzzFeed, have landed their first interviews with President Obama.Ezra Klein and Matt Yglesias of Vox sat down with the president in January. Their interview will be published online Monday morning. Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed, will speak with the president at the White House on Tuesday.The interviews are the latest indication that Vox and BuzzFeed News have emerged as serious news organizations, and are a further sign of the Obama administration's efforts to connect with millennials and broaden its reach beyond traditional media outlets.""We've always covered the White House quite aggressively, and I think that they want to speak to our audience,"" Mr. Smith said. ""This is sort of a demonstration of how, when you do serious news and you have a mass audience, those things can really support each other rather than getting in each other's way.""Mr. Obama will also participate in a video shoot with BuzzFeed's new video production unit.Vox and BuzzFeed News are both leveraging Facebook to publicize the conversations. On Sunday afternoon, Vox posted a short preview of its interview on the social networking site. BuzzFeed News has invited users to submit questions for the president before the interview, and plans to post video of Mr. Obama exclusively on Facebook.The interviews are the most recent attempt by President Obama to use new media platforms, including YouTube, Twitter and Vine, to get out his message on a number of policy issues. Mr. Obama has also appeared on the mock celebrity interview show ""Between Two Ferns,"" on the comedy website Funny or Die, and sat for interviews on ""The Daily Show"" and ""The Colbert Report.""Dan Pfeiffer, the departing senior adviser to the president, plans to offer recommendations for integrating the White House's digital media strategy with its communications operation.For both BuzzFeed News and Vox, the interviews represent a significant step forward for new digital media organizations, which continue to encroach on territory once reserved for print and broadcast news outlets.""Interviewing the president is a great journalistic opportunity, and that's how we approached it,"" Mr. Klein said in a statement. ""What we wanted to do here, above all, was to create something that would have a lot of enduring value to our readers.""In the brief video clip posted on Vox's Facebook page, Mr. Obama's remarks are interspersed with infographics. By Sunday evening, the video had already been viewed more than 320,000 times.",0.0
Kentucky: Sheriff Defends Officer Shown Handcuffing Child in Video:   [Brief ],,"The county sheriff in Covington on Tuesday defended a school resource officer who was shown on a video restraining an 8-year-old boy with handcuffs last year, saying the officer had acted appropriately while responding to a request from school officials to ""de-escalate and defuse a threat to others."" The handcuffing is the subject of a federal lawsuit filed Monday by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Kenton County sheriff's office, Sheriff Charles L. Korzenborn and the resource officer, Deputy Kevin Sumner; a video shows the boy, who has attention hyperactivity deficit disorder and had been acting out in school, crying as Deputy Sumner holds his arms behind his back and places handcuffs on his biceps. In a statement, Sheriff Korzenborn said the deputy ""did what he is sworn to do and in conformity with all constitutional and law enforcement standards.""",0.0
"A Year Later, Cable Giants' Merger Is Still Up in the Air:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"A year after it was announced, Comcast's audacious acquisition of Time Warner Cable remains in limbo as Washington regulators scrutinize the deal. No surprise there. After all, the $45 billion merger would consolidate an already-concentrated industry, uniting the two largest cable operators in the United States.But in recent weeks, the air of inevitability around the deal has dissipated. With the Federal Communications Commission proposing stringent new rules to govern the Internet, analysts have grown more skeptical about the acquisition being approved. Investors began betting against the combination late last month, with shares of both companies falling sharply before recovering last week.""The prospects for the deal, while they're still not bad, have continued to go down,"" said Kevin Werbach, a former F.C.C. counsel and a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.Advisers to both companies acknowledge that passing regulatory muster is far from certain. Yet David L. Cohen, an executive vice president at Comcast, expressed confidence that the merger would still be approved but acknowledged that the outcome was hard to handicap.""This is a bit of a black-box process,"" he said. ""You don't really know what's going on under the surface.""In Washington, officials at the Justice Department and F.C.C. are poring over data to decide whether to approve the deal, and what if any concessions the companies must make to satisfy antitrust laws. The review continues even as Comcast and Time Warner Cable are completing the minutiae of their planned merger.Among the issues being examined by regulators are whether a combined Comcast and Time Warner Cable would have too much sway over how traffic moves around the Internet and how much consumers and companies pay for Internet access.If regulators allow the deal, the company would control an estimated 35 percent of broadband Internet service coverage and just under 30 percent of the country's pay television subscribers.Fueling the uncertainty is a series of remarks made by Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F.C.C., before a vote by the commission on Feb. 26. Mr. Wheeler has proposed regulating the Internet like a utility, under Title II of the Communications Act.If approved, such a move would give the F.C.C. the authority to ensure that content is not blocked on the Internet, and that broadband providers cannot charge companies for the privilege of allowing their websites to load faster -- the essential components of what is known as net neutrality.Though Mr. Wheeler's proposal is not directly related to the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger, those familiar with the F.C.C. say it signals a more vigorous approach to protecting customers, which could also affect thinking on the deal.""What the F.C.C. is now apparently going to adopt signals a much harder line on their view of the state of competition in the broadband market,"" Mr. Werbach said. ""If their view is that the market is not working as it is right now, it's less likely that they're going to feel that a combination of two of the largest players is going to be in the public interest.""If Comcast's acquisition of Time Warner Cable were to be blocked by either agency, the industry could be thrown into tumult, with industry observers speculating that it would set off a flurry of new deal activity.""I don't think they would say so publicly, but I think everyone involved has to be at least considering a Plan B,"" said Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson research. He recently lowered his odds that the deal goes through from 80-20 to 70-30, for factors including a changing regulatory environment and potential changes to how regulators define the broadband market.Yet with all the uncertainty, it is impossible to know how the F.C.C. and Justice Department will rule. Regulators rarely telegraph their intentions, though in some past deals that have been blocked, regulators have sent subtle signals about how reviews were going; they have yet to do that during this review process.Comcast is in touch with regulators almost every day, Mr. Cohen said, supplying them with information about business operations and plans for the integration of Time Warner Cable.""There is nothing that we have heard as part of those contacts that suggest this transaction's review is any different than our prior transaction reviews, when our deals have been approved,"" he said.Time Warner Cable executives also expressed confidence in the deal, saying on a recent conference call that they expect the closing of the merger with Comcast to occur ""early this year.""Comcast deploys a vigorous lobbying effort in Washington, spending $17 million on such efforts last year, which made the cable operator one of the biggest corporate campaigners in the country. In several instances, state and local officials, including Hawaii's governor and Oregon's secretary of state, have sent letters to the F.C.C. supporting the deal that were written almost entirely by Comcast employees. (Government officials first had asked Comcast for help in providing the information.)As for the government's own timetable, the Justice Department has no firm deadline. The F.C.C. has an informal agenda to rule by the end of March, but could extend that.Consideration of the deal by the F.C.C.is expected to intensify next month, after the net neutrality vote. At the same time, both the F.C.C. and the Justice Department are weighing the antitrust ramifications of another proposed media merger, the acquisition of DirecTV by AT&T.Even if regulators approved the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger, they could demand onerous concessions from Comcast. If that were to occur, or if Comcast decided that new net neutrality rules would hurt the merged company, it could simply change its mind and refuse to complete the deal, which forgoes a breakup fee.Mr. Cohen emphasized this point in an interview. ""It is absolutely accurate that we have a very broad right to walk away from the transaction,"" he said, without elaborating on what conditions could cause Comcast to walk away.Yet he cautioned that there was no indication that regulators would ask for costly divestitures.""There hasn't been anything that we have heard at this point that has led us to believe that anybody is thinking about imposing overly burdensome conditions on this transaction,"" Mr. Cohen said.But if regulators did ask for some divestitures, Comcast is unlikely to simply abandon the deal. In Time Warner Cable, Comcast sees the opportunity to become a truly national provider of television, Internet and phone services, giving it unparalleled scale.Amy Yong, an analyst with Macquarie research, said the importance of Time Warner Cable's assets had only increased for Comcast in the last year, as competition from telecom providers like AT&T and new entrants like Google has grown fiercer.Because there is no formal proposal, Mr. Cohen would not say whether the new net neutrality rules might make the deal less financially attractive to Comcast. Even if the proposal is approved, it will face months, and possibly years, of review and potential legal appeals. Before that process is complete, a new administration could change the rules yet again.Comcast, meanwhile, is spending countless hours and millions of dollars planning to swallow Time Warner Cable, and brushing aside any suggestion that the regulatory winds are blowing the wrong way.""There's no demonstrable information out there that that is the case,"" Mr. Cohen said. ""The regulators haven't talked, because they never talk.""Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.",0.0
Europe; Russia: Man Is Accused of Killing and Dismembering His Six Children:   [Brief ],,"The Russian police have arrested a man suspected of killing and dismembering his six young children, his wife and his mother. The suspect, Oleg Belov, was wounded by police gunfire while resisting arrest and was in stable condition Wednesday after surgery, local health officials said.

"Hitting the Gym and the Trails, Looking to Extend the Golden Years:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"VINCE AND LINDA FERRIGNO no longer eat 30 fried shrimp every Friday night. In fact, they rarely eat anything fried. Instead of drenching their salads in dressing, they dip in a fork and spear the vegetables. They mostly steer clear of bread and pasta, and limit their daily caloric intake to 1,500. They write down their fitness objectives, and they exercise together three days a week.""It's good for our marriage, good for our health,"" said Ms. Ferrigno, 67, a retired wedding consultant who lives with her husband in Jacksonville, Fla.This routine was not always so. It wasn't until Mr. Ferrigno, now 78 and the retired owner of a company that made air-conditioners, was in his early 70s that he started caring about his physical well-being. But even then he did not do much about it.Working out was never his thing. ""I played a little ball, but that was it. I'm not like Louie Ferrigno,"" he said, referring to Lou Ferrigno, the actor and former body builder who played the title character in the television show ""The Incredible Hulk."" (He's a distant cousin, Vince Ferrigno says.)After selling his company two years ago, Mr. Ferrigno decided it was time, finally, to shed the 70 pounds that had plagued him since he began logging 10 to 12 hours a day in the office. If he didn't lose weight, he wouldn't be able to enjoy his retirement. He might not even live many more years. ""I started realizing I had to change my ways or 90 or 100 isn't going to be reached,"" said Mr. Ferrigno, who has high blood pressure.To help him stay on track, he and his wife, who has lost 30 pounds, spend a week each year at Hilton Head Health, a weight loss resort in South Carolina, which costs $3,290 per person, per week ($2,800 per person if two or more come together). There they exercise three to four hours a day, eat healthy food and enjoy lectures on nutrition and general well-being. Mr. Ferrigno has gone from 250 pounds to 210, and hopes to reach 195.Common wisdom has held that if you have not adopted an exercise or fitness routine in your early years, you probably won't start in later life. But like so many misconceptions about middle and post-middle age, the idea is slowly fading way. According to the International Health Racquet & Sportsclub Association, people 55 and older are the fastest-growing membership segment for the health club industry. In 1990, 1.9 million health club members were age 55 and above; last year, that figure hit 12 million, a 532 percent increase.Many clubs are catering to this age group, hiring trainers with specialized certifications and offering specific low-impact classes, said Meredith Poppler, a spokeswoman for the association. An April 2015 report from Marketdata Enterprises, which tracks the diet and fitness industry, estimates that 17.2 million adults 55 and older are dieting.The driving force is usually health. ""They had a heart attack, or a friend had a heart attack,"" said Dr. John Whyte, an internist in Great Falls, Va., and author of the ""AARP New American Diet: Lose Weight, Live Longer."" ""They've been told they have pre-diabetes. They finally get a 'jolt' that makes them decide they need to start working out.""Medicare will cover obesity screening and behavioral counseling, though there are some stipulations.So many people, especially those with discretionary income, are starting their programs at fitness and health resorts, where they can exercise in a controlled environment, eat healthful food and learn about proper nutrition. Retirees often have the time and resources to drop out of the real world for a few weeks and focus on their health.Sheree Janke, 57, of Edmonton, Alberta, is a semiretired dental hygienist who works one day a week. Seven years ago she wanted to lose the 41 pounds she had gained after having three children in nearly four years. Her blood pressure was rising, and her doctor wanted to put her on medication. She balked. ""Once you start going on those meds you don't get off of them unless you make a major lifestyle change,"" she said.She did a web search for ""boot camp"" and found Fitness Ridge (now called Movara Fitness Resort), in Ivins, Utah. For about $1,500 a week, she could hike six to eight miles a day, eat three healthful meals, take exercise classes and get herself back on track. She lost the weight, which she has more or less kept off, and returns to Movara annually for a tuneup.""It was the motivation I needed to keep getting healthier in order to have a better quality of life in retirement,"" Ms. Janke said.For Ms. Janke, Movara's price tag only added to her drive. ""I realized there is not much good in having all this money invested in retirement products if I didn't have a healthy body to live in,"" she said. ""Sometimes retirement focus becomes so much on the money accumulated rather than the quality of life you are going to have in retirement.""Exercise certainly helps people look and feel younger. A recent study of participants in the Senior Olympics, a biennial competition for amateur athletes over 50, found that older athletes' fitness age was about 20-plus years younger than their chronological age. What's more, a majority of the 10,000 men and women competing in this year's games, held in Minneapolis-St. Paul in early July, didn't begin serious training until middle age or later. Of course, not everyone plans to pole-vault in later life. For others, exercise and diet are also about mental health, and changing their approach to aging.For the last four years, Joe Boland, 61, who sells software in Ann Arbor, Mich., has worked with Steve Dailey, a business coach in Pahoa, Hawaii, to help him with his professional goals. Now he's focusing on his physical health. Next month, he is going to visit Mr. Dailey, who runs Base Camp Hawaii and Body Temple Boot Camp with his wife, Kieba Blacklidge Dailey.""I have not yet achieved my optimal weight goal. It's been a challenge for some years,"" said Mr. Boland, a former athlete who has had five knee surgeries. Although he swims two to three times a week and tries to eat well, he carries around 60 extra pounds. ""One of the motivations is that I want to live to be 90, and I want to keep walking and be healthy. My orthopedic surgeon says guys my size usually are not able to walk independently in their 70s, so I need to lose some weight.""But weight loss is just part of the plan. ""What he will focus on goes far beyond exercise and nutrition,"" said Mr. Dailey, 61, a former competitive swimmer. ""Exercise and nutrition are tools for a successful life. They aren't the end goal. My focus for Joe during his time here will be about developing a mind-set and the tools for living an extraordinary and purposed life in his second half.""John Striker, 71, a retired publisher who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, has hiked through Pakistan and India. He didn't want to lose his ""joy"" in later life. ""It's too easy to drift off into getting old,"" he said. ""The muscles are just not responding. You get up in the morning and you're stiffer. You've got to draw a line in the sand and say, 'I'm not going let that happen.' You have to up the effort to stay in shape.""For the last nine years, he has paid a visit to Mountain Trek in British Columbia every other year to be rejuvenated, paying $4,500 for seven nights. He hikes from five to 12 miles a day enjoying beautiful scenery, and eats no sugar or processed foods. He believes it is money well spent.""As I get older, I need to be reminded of the potential of my body, what it's capable of doing if I really take care of it,"" he said. ""My body may not be what it was at 25, but it can still respond.""Make the most of your money.

"Temporary Tattoos, Now for Grown-Ups, Too:   [Style Desk ]",,"At a Friday night cocktail party early this year at the auction house Christie's, some 400 prospective buyers in their 30s and 40s were checking out the old masterworks up for auction, including Caravaggio, a pair of Canalettos and a sketch by Rubens. But the art that drew the most fuss from the collectors was free: temporary tattoos that echoed the paintings for sale, including demons by a follower of Hieronymus Bosch and the monogram-like signature of Albrecht Dürer.The tattoos -- which the Phillip Lim- and Thom Browne-clad attendees applied two, three and four at a time (and Instagrammed in equal number) -- were so popular that party organizers eventually had to ask representatives from Tattly, the company that created them, to stop handing them out. It was after closing time, the bar had stopped serving, and the guests, still debating between Delft-like seashells and flowers from Balthasar van der Ast, showed no signs of leaving.""That's not typical for an old master painting party,"" Emma Kronman of Christie's said dryly. She added, ""I can't tell you how many people wrote to us afterward saying, 'Do you have any extra tattoos?' ""So much for Kim Kardashian's edict about tattoos: ""Don't put a bumper sticker on a Bentley."" In recent years, the no-commitment-required ink has gone from staple of children's birthday parties to of-the-moment accessory for all ages, applied at events organized by Vogue and Christian Louboutin and worn by celebrities like Beyoncé and Sarah Jessica Parker. (The model Cara Delevingne sported custom Chinese birds and blossoms on her arms, neck and chest at this year's Met Gala.)There are now more than a dozen companies offering ways to sleeve up for a day or three. But perhaps no company has done more to elevate temporary tattoos to wearable art than Tattly, a four-year-old Brooklyn-based company that works with artists like Milton Glaser, creator of the iconic ""I love NY"" logo; Stefan Sagmeister, who has designed album covers for David Byrne and the Rolling Stones; and the fashion photographer Garance Doré. Tattly tattoos are available at 1,000 stores in 30 countries, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Conran Shop in London, and Colette in Paris.""I've never seen such tasteful temporary tattoos,"" said John Maeda, the design partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and a former president of the Rhode Island School of Design. ""Temporary tattoos were down-market, and Tattly found a way to make them fashionable through high-quality content."" (Mr. Maeda has worn a Tattly tattoo just one time -- ""I felt cool for once,"" he said -- but regularly suggests them for gifts.)Tattly started as a side project for Tina Roth Eisenberg, voice of the notable design blog Swissmiss (she grew up in Speicher, Switzerland), and the kind of person who has a permanent ""out of office"" reply on her email. Her other successful side projects include CreativeMornings, a design-focused speaker series now on six continents, and TeuxDeux, an app Fast Company called ""the web's most beautiful to-do list.""In the spring of 2011, Ms. Eisenberg's daughter, who was 6, came home from a birthday party with yet another sheet of ""butterflies and ugly smiley faces,"" Ms. Eisenberg said. ""Granted, I'm probably a little bit snobby, but they were an insult to my Swiss aesthetics.""Ms. Eisenberg, who has a rule that she can only complain about something for so long before doing something about it, applied the offending tattoos to her daughter's arm, then promptly searched online for ways to make her own and emailed illustrator friends soliciting ideas. A specialist in user interface design, she created a website for Tattly (the name is a homage to her roots: ""When you want to make something sound cute in Swiss German, you add -ly on the end,"" she said). The site went live that July with 16 whimsical designs printed in vegetable ink, including a candy-colored '80s style Casio watch that reads ""late"" (still one of the company's top sellers) and a pencil-like scribble.Thanks in part to Ms. Eisenberg's blog and more than 430,000 Twitter followers, Tattly had 140 orders by the end of the first day. On the second day, a woman from the Tate Modern hunted down Ms. Eisenberg's phone number and called to request a wholesale catalog. Roughly 30 percent of online sales are international.Things really took off when, six months later, the Brooklyn Brewery requested a custom tattoo to distribute at its events. (It was designed by Mr. Glaser.) Soon, NPR asked for its popular radio shows to be reimagined as vintage ink, like a ""This American Life"" mermaid, and two tangled cobras for the two hosts of ""On the Media."" (Take that, pledge-drive tote bag.)Recent clients include SoulCycle, which distributed gold and silver wheels at its Hamptons studios; Mashable, which commissioned six emoji for its SXSW house; and the luxury brand Maiyet, which scattered hieroglyph-like black feather tattoos (one of the company's symbols) on the tables at a V.I.P. dinner in Gstaad, Switzerland. Also this year, Wilhelmina Models ordered gold script W's and ""XOWilhelmina"" (the founder's signature) for Art Basel, Coachella and New York Fashion Week.""We wanted it to be cool because we're catering to the model crowd and the fashion crowd, and it was a hit,"" said Tatiana Acosta, director of marketing for Wilhelmina Models. In what appears to be a standard refrain with Tattly clients, she added, ""Models kept coming back to my office and asking for more tattoos.""Tattly now offers some 600 designs, including vintage pastel-colored cameras, fruits and vegetables (distributed at the White House Easter egg hunt this year), Christoph Niemann's stylized battery running low on energy, and a black ""No sleep till Brooklyn"" (Instagrammed by Gwyneth Paltrow.) Artists receive royalties from the sale of their tattoos; last year, the company paid out more than $250,000. Last year, the company brought on Yng-Ru Chen, formerly of Sotheby's, to head up its lucrative partnerships (Athleta, for example, recently ordered 450,000 tattoos) and court the company's wish list of artists.Paola Antonelli, senior curator of the department of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, described the tattoos as ""so easy to wear,"" and ticked off the ones she's tried: ""The spiral labyrinth, the carrot, the arrows. I've worn the golden watch."" Of Ms. Eisenberg, Ms. Antonelli said: ""She's Wonder Woman. Ideas are a dollar a pound. Making them happen is a real heroic thing.""This Ms. Eisenberg does by sticking to her exacting standards. After a three-hour tour of a packing center in New Jersey, she was ready to sign on, until she realized the company ""would slap an ugly UPS label"" on shipments, she said, and wouldn't let her change it. In what she described as her ""very unusual, refreshing, direct way,"" she told them, ""I will not ship with you because my packaging needs to be awesome.""So it's done by hand in-house, which until this spring was a 1,600-square-foot space in a rundown former factory in Dumbo. (""I usually don't get in the elevator without food in case I'm stuck in here for hours,"" an employee said in that elevator.) Recently, the company roughly doubled its space with a move to a 1860s carriage factory in Cobble Hill, alongside studios of three of its artists.Ms. Eisenberg's principles also involve buying quirky designs even if she doesn't think they'll sell (she cites one ""sad straggler"" of little people in cars that she won't take off the website, even though ""we have like 4,996 left"" of a run of 5,000). Artists say she is more likely to say of designs ""not right now,"" instead of ""no."" Her criticism is usually spot on.""I did a pizza slice, and they said: 'Make it more greasy. Put more pepperoni, more cheese, make it more drippy,' "" said the illustrator Julia Rothman, whose designs include the ""late"" watch tattoo. ""When I look back at the original, I think, for sure, it needed this.""Ms. Rothman, who has created 81 Tattly designs, said she has been pleasantly surprised by the company's success. ""I knew because it was Tina it would be successful,"" she said, ""but I thought maybe it would fade.""Photograph An Attendee at a Party at Christie's, Wearing a Painting-Inspired Temporary Tattoo by Tattly.

"Paid Notice: Deaths CARRINGTON, KATHLEEN:   [Paid Death Notice ]",,"CARRINGTON--Kathleen. Kathleen Connell Carrington, 88, passed away peacefully on November 7, 2015 in Greenville, South Carolina. Kay, as she was known by her friends and family, was a steadfast and loving wife and mother. Born January 11, 1927 in Jersey City, New Jersey to John Norman Connell and Helen Burke Connell, Kay was one of nine children. Beautiful and unassuming, with an easy sense of humor and disarming smile, Kay graduated from Notre Dame College in Baltimore soon after the Second World War. Shortly thereafter she married Jim Carrington, a three-sport All-American, at the U.S. Naval Academy. In what has been described as a fairytale wedding, the midshipmen in their dress-whites rained rice upon the stunningly beautiful newlyweds as they ran beneath a shining arc of crossed sabers. Kay taught school until the arrival of the first of her five children, whom she raised in or near seaports around the world, from Yokosuka, Japan to Annapolis, Maryland. Like most Navy wives, while her husband was away at sea, often for months at a time, she stoically ran the householdwithout ever a complaint. Kay and Jim taught their children a great deal, but perhaps their most precious legacy was setting an example of how wonderful a marriage can be. As irony would have it, in the precise moment of Kay's sudden passing, all her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren were gathered together in California for the marriage of her grandson Michael. The thought would have pleased her to no end. Kay is survived by her daughters, Wendy Carrington, Nancy (Steve) Crown, and Kathleen (Steven) Anderson; sons, James Carrington, Jr., and Timothy (Cathleen) Carrington; sisters, Shelly Cullen, Madeleine Reilly, Elizabeth De Souza; brother, James Connell; ten grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews. She was preceded in death by her parents; husband James H.H. Carrington; sisters, Elise Leahy, Mary Lou Towey, and Nancy Bockus; brother, Jack Connell; and daughter-in-law Antonella Murgia Carrington. A service celebrating Kay's life is being planned for the spring of 2016. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Rheumatology Research Foundation, 2200 Lake Boulevard NE, Atlanta, GA 30319 or www.rheumresearch.org. 1/3",0.0
F.D.A. Takes Issue With the Term 'Non-G.M.O.':   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"Lost in the news about the Food and Drug Administration's approval of genetically engineered salmon on Thursday was its long-awaited guidelines on labeling food with or without genetically altered plant ingredients.While the F.D.A.'s stance on labeling -- it is not mandating disclosure of genetically modified ingredients -- has not changed despite intense pressure from both sides of the issue, it has added a bit of confusion to the mix for consumers and for those companies that are voluntarily including more information on their packaging.For starters, the F.D.A. does not favor the most commonly used term, non-G.M.O., which hundreds of companies plaster on tens of thousands of products on grocery store shelves.Short for ""genetically modified organism,"" G.M.O. conveys an overly broad and inaccurate meaning when applied to food products, the agency said.""Most foods do not contain entire organisms,"" the F.D.A. noted.Rather, the agency would prefer labels that say something like ""Not bioengineered"" or ""This oil is made from soybeans that were not genetically engineered.""Whether any food companies will adopt this language, or begin using nongenetically engineered foods rather than non-G.M.O., is unknown at this point.But major food companies have applauded the agency's position to not require genetically engineered ingredients to be disclosed. The F.D.A. has determined that such products are not materially different from their nonengineered cousins.Many food corporations have lobbied heavily against mandatory labeling, fearing that customers will be scared off by foods known to contain genetically engineered ingredients.Claire Parker, spokeswoman for the Coalition for Safe and Affordable Food, a food industry group, said in a statement that the coalition applauded the F.D.A. ""for standing up for sound science by opposing mandatory G.M.O. labeling that would mislead consumers and drive up food costs.""Many major food companies have already moved to voluntarily label products that do not contain genetically engineered ingredients, either simply stating that on their packaging or using a small butterfly seal to show that the Non-GMO Project, a nonprofit that provides certification for food producers, has certified the absence of genetic engineering.""All of the biggest food companies in the country are looking at how to source non-G.M.O. ingredients right now,"" said Megan Westgate, executive director of the Non-GMO Project, adding that it seems that the government's decision about the G.M.O. salmon was out of step with what the public is asking for.Ms. Westgate said that about 34,000 products were now labeled with the Non-GMO Project's seal, representing about $13.5 billion in annual sales. That's up from January, when 24,500 products bore the seal. (The Food Marketing Institute estimates that total supermarket sales were $638 billion last year.)Efforts at the state level over the last few years to mandate labeling of foods that do contain genetically engineered ingredients have largely failed by narrow margins, after heavy lobbying and campaign spending by the food and biotech industries.A labeling law was passed in Vermont and should take effect in July unless food industry groups succeed in getting it blocked by an appellate court.As that deadline approaches, lobbyists for the food and biotech businesses are scrambling to get federal legislation in place that would pre-empt such state-level requirements. The House of Representatives passed a bill that would do just that, and Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat of Michigan, said she hoped to get legislation passed in the Senate by the end of the year.The Senate bill might require companies to reveal the presence of genetic engineering via a QR code, a pixelated square that can be scanned with a smartphone, on packaging.Joe Sparatta, a chef with two restaurants, Heritage and Southbound, in Richmond, Va., said he was especially concerned about the F.D.A.'s decision not to require labeling of the genetically engineered salmon because his customers were demanding more information about the food on his menus.""Guests ask about everything,"" Mr. Sparatta said. ""Is there dairy in this? Is this fish wild or farmed? What are your animals eating? We try to source as much as we can locally, which helps us know more about the products we use, but we can't get everything from around here.""He said that customers had only recently begun to ask about whether things were genetically modified, but he expected to get the question more frequently. ""With this now being debated in Congress, I think more people are hearing about it and starting to ask questions and want to know,"" Mr. Sparatta said.Consumers are increasingly looking for information about the presence of genetically modified ingredients in their foods, according to research by the Hartman Group. ""The G.M.O. issue is something that continues to be brought up in an unprompted way in our interviews with consumers,"" said Laurie Demeritt, chief executive of Hartman. ""And when we look at things like fat, sodium and sugar, G.M.O. is showing the strongest growth rate in terms of a characteristic that consumers are trying to avoid.""In research Hartman did for a report on perceptions about genetically modified foods, about 58 percent of consumers were looking for ""non-G.M.O."" food.""It's connected to this idea that a product is processed,"" Ms. Demeritt said. ""Consumers have a vision in their minds of people in lab coats taking syringes and injecting things into a product, a vision of food made in a lab -- and that's even worse in their minds than food coming off a factory line.""She added that consumers did not necessarily understand what genetic engineering is, or even which crops are genetically engineered. ""While it's difficult for some people in the food space to hear because they want to educate consumers and talk to them about it, in most cases, consumers don't really want to hear a long explanation about the science behind it,"" she said.But if anything, the F.D.A. further complicated the issue by distinguishing the term ""genetic engineering"" from ""genetic modification.""""F.D.A. considers the term 'genetic modification' to be a much broader term that encompasses other means of altering the genome of an organism including selective breeding, and lab-based in vitro methods,"" the agency said in its announcement.The F.D.A. said it had no plans to take action against labels using ""G.M.O."" -- so long as the food in question was not genetically engineered in any way and the label was not otherwise false or misleading.Nonetheless, given the agency's definition of genetic modification, non-G.M.O labeling on thousands of products now in stores would technically be false because they contain plants genetically modified over centuries through hybridization and other conventional breeding techniques.For instance, under the F.D.A.'s definition, a corn chip made from conventional corn is genetically modified, but not genetically engineered -- an argument that the biotech industry has been making for years.Thus, the F.D.A cautioned that terms like ""G.M.O. free"" and ""non-G.M.O."" could face challenges and recommended that ""manufacturers not use food labeling claims that indicate that a food is 'free' of ingredients derived through the use of biotechnology.""""They're conflating what is a very new and novel technology with traditional types of breeding, which is simply crossing different varieties of, say, corn,"" said Andrew Kimbrell, founder and executive director of the Center for Food Safety, which is lobbying for mandatory labeling. ""It's kind of like saying an abacus is very much like a computer.""",0.0

"Wanted or Not, a Superheroic Rebooting:   [Review ]",,"The opening scenes of ""Fantastic Four"" -- 20th Century Fox's reboot of its Marvel superhero franchise -- take place in 2007, which happens to be the year that the second movie in the prerebooted franchise (""Rise of the Silver Surfer"") was released. Ben Grimm and Reed Richards (played as children by Evan Hannemann and Owen Judge, later by Jamie Bell and Miles Teller) don't mention that fact, because if they did the cinematic universe would collapse on itself and all light would be extinguished from the cosmos. Also, the thoughtful people at Fox probably don't want to remind anyone of those earlier movies.Some of us have long memories, though, and can summon the bad cinema of the mid-aughts with furious clarity. Looking back on those days, I remember -- Jessica Alba. O.K., forget it. I'll just go ahead and reboot my 2005 review of the first ""Fantastic Four"" origin story, which I said was ""fantastic only in its commitment to mediocrity."" That's still true, though a decade later it's true in different ways. Are you offended that I'm recycling material? Sorry, but I'm as susceptible to the influence of movies as anyone else.This ""Fantastic Four,"" directed by Josh Trank from a script he wrote with Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, feels less like a tale of superhero beginnings than like a very long precredit opening sequence. As boys growing up on Long Island, Reed and Ben are brains-and-brawn science-fair buddies.Reed is working on a teleporting machine that attracts the attention of Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), who runs some kind of boarding school/research center in Manhattan. There, Reed meets the Storm kids, Sue the scientist (Kate Mara) and Johnny the hot-rodder (Michael B. Jordan), and also a brooding intellectual named Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell).Much later, after they have traveled to a parallel dimension where a planet full of energy (please just fill in whatever exposition you feel will get you to the next part of this sentence), Victor will face down his erstwhile classmates and say: ""There is no more Victor. There is only DOOM!"" There is nothing wrong with that kind of line -- he's a newly fledged ultravillain in a comic-book movie, after all -- but it needs to be earned, with gravity or wit. The best superhero entertainments have both.""Fantastic Four,"" despite the dogged efforts of its talented young cast, has nothing. The special effects are at about the level of the early ""Harry Potter"" movies -- lots of glowing green clouds and ice-blue bolts and force fields. The human drama is meager. Once again, the only real pathos belongs to Mr. Bell's Ben, who finds himself trapped in a stony new body and weaponized by a ruthless government. Mr. Teller stretches, not as an actor but as a digitally enhanced body. Mr. Jordan burns in the same way, and Ms. Mara disappears. Her character also has the power to make other things vanish. I would say she should have exercised it on this movie, but in a week or two that should take care of itself.""Fantastic Four"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

"In Ukraine, It's Putin's Game:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BRUSSELS -- His country's oil export revenues and currency have slumped. Its economy is shrinking, and some of his own allies in Moscow have questioned where he is leading them. Yet when President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia sat down Wednesday in the Belarussian capital of Minsk with the leaders of Ukraine, Germany and France to discuss the conflict in eastern Ukraine, he still held the decisive cards.For months now, Europe's often fractious leaders have spoken with one voice on Ukraine, ruling out a military solution and pleading with all parties to find a way to resolve the dispute diplomatically. But in Minsk, they confronted the reality that Mr. Putin retains the upper hand precisely because he is prepared to use military force to get what he wants in diplomacy.In a sign of Europe's commitment to diplomacy, both Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, the Continent's most powerful political figure, and President François Hollande of France, the leader of Western Europe's biggest country, traveled to Minsk on Wednesday in a last-ditch attempt to revive a moribund peace process begun in September with a truce deal, which was also negotiated in Minsk. They did so despite what Ms. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said was just ""a glimmer of hope.""However, in Minsk, Europe's faith in a ""political solution"" -- a mantra repeated over the past year at every meeting in Brussels of leaders and foreign ministers -- confronted the hard reality created by Mr. Putin, whose support for separatist rebels gutted the last Minsk agreement, empowered their quest for a clear military solution and amplified voices in Washington calling for military aid to Ukraine.""Putin has got everyone spun up over what he is up to in Minsk, but he is playing a long game,"" said Fiona Hill, the United States' top intelligence officer on Russia from 2006 to 2009. ""He plays on multiple fronts. We start talking about a military response, and he starts talking about diplomacy.""Ms. Hill, now director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution and co-author of ""Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin,"" predicted that any new cease-fire accord would ""only be temporary like the last one"" because Mr. Putin constantly shifts between diplomatic and military options, depending on which he sees as giving Russia the most advantage.The West, she added, assisted Russia's tactical maneuvering by making it clear what it wanted while Mr. Putin constantly keeps everyone guessing. ""You can win on a weak hand if your opponent is always showing you their hand,"" she said.Speaking in Brussels on Monday during a meeting of European foreign ministers that again reaffirmed the sanctity of diplomacy over force, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, stressed that Wednesday's talks in Minsk between the leaders of France, Germany, Russia, Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists needed to strengthen, not rewrite, September's so-called Minsk Protocol.But he acknowledged that fully putting it into effect was no longer an option because of what he called ""certain evolutions on the ground,"" namely a steady advance by pro-Russian fighters that has extended the territory they control by more than 200 square miles since September.In the weeks preceding Wednesday's Minsk summit talks, pro-Russian rebels, fortified by fresh supplies of Russian weapons, seized the ruins of the Donetsk airport and launched a determined offensive against the town of Debaltseve, an important rail junction and the last pocket of Ukrainian-held territory in a wide swath of territory north of Donetsk.The gap between Europe's dogged diplomacy and Mr. Putin's approach to Ukraine, which mixes regular calls for peace with stealthy supplies of Russian weapons and even soldiers to the separatists, has left Moscow and Brussels ""playing entirely different games,"" said Amanda Paul, a Russia expert at the European Policy Center, a Brussels research group.""Putin can outmaneuver us because he knows what our limits are. He knows we will not deploy troops. He knows that even if the United States decides to send some arms, Russia is still strong enough to defeat Ukraine,"" she added. ""But we have no idea what Putin's limits are. He does not show his cards. The West does. Maybe there is not a military solution, but we should keep Russia guessing.""While vague on his objectives in Ukraine beyond a determination to block what he sees as a plot by NATO to push deep into former Soviet territory, Mr. Putin has made clear his desire to divide the European Union, reaching out to countries like Hungary and Greece, where a new left-wing government has raised doubts about the wisdom of sanctions imposed on Moscow over Ukraine. So far, however, the 28-nation bloc has managed to stay unusually united, in part because it has stuck to relatively modest sanctions, in step with Washington.Linas A. Linkevicius, the foreign minister of Lithuania, one of the few European countries that support sending weapons to Ukraine, said, ""Diplomatic efforts are of course worthwhile, but we can't judge whether they are working, even if we get Russia's signature on an agreement. We have learned that we can only judge events on the ground.""""We cannot trust a single word of the Russian leadership,"" he added. ""They are all worthless.""The last Minsk agreement began to unravel almost as soon as it was signed. There were violations of the cease-fire on both sides, but particularly from the rebels, whose leader at the time, Pavel Gubarev, denounced the accord as a sellout and declared ""we want to spit on this 'peace.' ""Since then, the rebels have consolidated their previously fragmented land into a more defensible territory and have vowed to resist any return to a so-called ""demarcation line"" fixed in September. Mr. Fabius, the French foreign minister, indicated that France and Germany, which have taken the lead in Europe's diplomatic push, would accept revisions to the earlier accord, saying that it would be respected ""as far as possible.""An annual security conference in Munich last weekend was dominated by discussion about Ukraine and debate over whether Wednesday's peace talks would yield ""Minsk plus,"" a relaunch of last year's accord, or ""Minsk minus,"" a confirmation that the earlier agreement was dead and would be replaced by a new deal that enshrined the rebels' military gains.Skepticism was rife about the prospects for a deal that did not reward armed force, and the German government has been deliberately downbeat since, suggesting that the Minsk meeting not even take place and that if it did, hopes of an enduring settlement were slim.Asked whether it was more likely there would be a ""Minsk plus"" or a ""Minsk minus,"" Norbert Röttgen, the Christian Democrat who is chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the German Parliament, said he feared a minus from the Western standpoint.""I think there will either be nothing, because Putin unfortunately tactically has the upper hand in the short term,"" he said. ""And Poroshenko only has a limited amount of room to maneuver.""Or there will be a new cease-fire, a second Minsk, which would include a significant shift of the demarcation line to the West. The violation of Minsk 1 would then be honored in Minsk 2, and whether Putin would then keep to Minsk 2, there are considerable doubts,"" Mr. Röttgen added.Despite growing exasperation with Russia's meddling and its repeated denials of arms supplies, European nations have strong reasons to reject the idea of arming Ukraine, even with defensive weapons, and to rely solely on economic sanctions.""The only sector where Putin has nothing to fear is arms,"" Paolo Gentiloni, the foreign minister of Italy, said during an interview with The New York Times editorial board on Wednesday. ""Russia is weak in many sectors, but very strong in arms.""Any weapons sent to Ukraine by the United States, he said, might even help Mr. Putin as it ""could support his narrative"" that Russia has legitimate reasons to fear Western military encroachment on its borders.",0.0
Moving Fast to Share a Secret Language:   [Arts and Leisure Desk ],,"It was one thing for Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, a kid from New Jersey, to have 14,000 friends on MySpace at age 14 and 16,000 subscribers on YouTube at 18. But it's quite another for Halsey, Ms. Frangipane's pop-star alter ego, to have taken that innate 21st-century talent for self-presentation -- not to mention songwriting -- from her bedroom to arena stages in a mere year since signing with a record label.Instead of a viral flash of Internet lightning, Halsey, unfiltered and fast-talking, has been nurtured as an artist who could harness lasting loyalty online, not just one-off clicks. Now, with her nearly half a million followers on Twitter and more on Instagram contributing to the heavy lifting, the singer and her label -- Astralwerks, an electronic imprint under Capitol Music -- have set the stage for a potential mainstream breakthrough.With the release of her first album, ""Badlands,"" on Aug. 28, Halsey will attempt to translate the secret language she shares with her online followers for a wider audience without losing its essential intimacy. It's a rare tightrope walk pulled off by other web-driven artists like Lorde and Lana Del Rey.For Halsey, now 20, the next-level rollout includes television performances (starting with ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" on Aug. 25); a headlining fall tour that sold out almost immediately, resulting in upgraded venues and additional shows in major cities (including New York, where Halsey will play Webster Hall on Oct. 22 and 23); and -- her record company hopes -- at least one hit single, with bets currently placed on ""New Americana,"" a would-be generational anthem.[Video: Halsey - New Americana (Audio) Watch on YouTube.]But with ""Badlands,"" a brooding, conceptual electro-pop record with industrial undertones and big radio-ready hooks, Halsey has realized not just her label's vision but also her own. ""Being a pop-leaning, female artist, you'd think that I'd have my record company breathing down my neck and trying to control everything I'm doing,"" Halsey said while finishing ""Badlands"" in the spring. ""Actually, they've just kind of let me take the wheel.""The foundation, after all, was hers. In March, Halsey had her industry coming-out party at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Tex. But at an event all about manufacturing the appearance of buzz, Halsey's needed no fluffing: Amid the label types, teenage girls stood rapt at the front of a small stage, many of them holding up cellphones and beaming the performance via video chat to tearful friends at home.Outside the club, another cluster of young people pressed against a single window to catch a glimpse. By the festival's end, Twitter had named her most-tweeted-about artist, ahead of Miley Cyrus.""I remember walking into Capitol Records, sitting down with the executives and having them say, 'Look at what you did while none of us were paying attention,' "" Halsey said over bubble tea in the East Village in April. ""That was one of the proudest moments of my entire life. I put all the groundwork in myself, and they let me do my thing, because it's working.""""Ghost,"" Ms. Frangipane's first single as Halsey, was self-released on iTunes in January 2014, plugged to her tens of thousands of followers across social media. To Halsey, it was ""just another piece of content,"" she said. ""But now people who were quiet before and would just silently 'like' my pictures had something to engage with.""[Video: Halsey - Ghost Watch on YouTube.]The track exploded online, earning Halsey interest from five notable labels within days. She took some meetings but initially held out, and by late April, ""Ghost"" had found its way to SiriusXM's Hits 1 station, which played the independent single alongside songs by Lady Gaga and Pharrell Williams.Glenn Mendlinger, the senior vice president and general manager of Astralwerks, recalled hearing ""Ghost"" soon after at the label's weekly new music meeting. ""We have to find her immediately,"" he said. They did, and the next day, Mr. Mendlinger pushed back a flight to have an 11 a.m. meeting with Halsey.""By 1:30, I had sent an email to the entire executive team saying: 'I just met this girl. The music is phenomenal. She is a star. We have to get engaged immediately.' I was really enthralled,"" he said. ""It's what you wait for."" By 7:07 p.m., Astralwerks had offered her a record deal.Then it was time to slow down. ""It wasn't about going to radio immediately"" despite the early traction, Mr. Mendlinger said. ""If we had gone with 'Ghost' without any base behind it, we had a high probability of losing."" Instead, the plan was to record an EP -- Halsey's five-song ""Room 93"" was released in October -- get her on the road and continue building an online congregation.""We saw how she was already connecting, so we knew that was an avenue we needed to pursue with her,"" Mr. Mendlinger said of the singer's social media army, made up more of advocates than of passive fans.Halsey, who is preternaturally self-possessed and becomes gleeful in moments of defiance, slips into music-business-speak with the same ease with which she curses or describes her favorite websites. ""I cultivated this fan base that I really didn't really understand or appreciate until I put my first headlining tour up for sale,"" she said. ""500- to 1,000-capacity rooms weren't an underplay for me at the time. I'd never done a tour before!""Yet every date on that spring 2015 run sold out in less than 30 minutes, and Halsey soon graduated to an arena tour, opening this summer for the million-selling rock band Imagine Dragons and often packing the front rows despite being first on the three-act bill.""I come from a generation where these huge follower counts are normal,"" she said. ""But my interaction levels"" -- retweets, replies, click-throughs -- ""are incredibly high.""Halsey could be mistaken for a millennial built in a lab: Not only is she fluent in the language of modern marketing, but her openness on social media feels authentic and inextricable from her personality. Raised in Union County, N.J., by a white mother, who often accompanied her tween daughter to concerts, and a black father, who manages car dealerships, Halsey identifies as what she calls ""tri-bi"" -- biracial, bisexual and bipolar -- and speaks with ease and confidence about social issues.""Please don't erase my race because I'm white passing,"" she wrote on Twitter recently. ""There is literally nothing I can do about my complexion.""Her songs, which she writes herself with an array of young producers, are similarly candid and precocious. ""High on legal marijuana/Raised on Biggie and Nirvana/We are the new Americana,"" she sings. Although far from her most subtle song, ""New Americana"" was first played by the taste-making D.J. Zane Lowe on Apple's Beats 1 radio last month. ""Wow -- there's a new icon there, I think,"" he said after playing the track twice in a row. ""That record is big. Oh my God.""It soon spread to influential alternative stations like Live 105 in San Francisco and KROQ in Los Angeles. But Astralwerks may be taking a risk on rock radio, which sits outside Halsey's comfort zone. ""We know the fan base was leaning female and young,"" but alternative radio would introduce her to the 18-to-35 male demographic, Mr. Mendlinger said of that bet.Halsey is typically oppositional about the single's prospects. ""Everyone thinks it's going to be a cultural revolution, but I don't think it's that good,"" she said plainly. As for ""Ghost,"" which Astralwerks may yet push to pop radio, ""I'm so over that song,"" she said, and it only made the album as one of her few concessions to the label.More representative are songs like ""Hold Me Down"" -- ""I sold my soul to a three-piece/And he told me I was holy"" -- and ""Hurricane,"" an early track that made the deluxe edition of ""Badlands,"" on which she sings, ""I'm a wanderess/I'm a one-night stand/Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man.""[Video: Halsey - Hurricane Watch on YouTube.]Loaded with the knowingness of a cool older sister who sneaks into the city from the suburbs, Halsey's lyrics connected even before they were set to music. A breakup poem she wrote on Tumblr years ago has been ""liked"" and reblogged more than 820,000 times, taking on a viral life of its own (and even resulting in online plagiarism charges when she repurposed her own words as lyrics). At a Montauk hotel performance on Memorial Day, the Halsey faithful -- dyed hair, black lipstick -- stood out among the Hamptons regulars, singing every word. Some lingered for hours after the 20-minute show and burst into tears when Halsey's mother, who is recognized at every concert, told them the singer would visit with them soon.[Video: Halsey - Hold Me Down (Live Performance) (Vevo LIFT): Brought to You By McDonald's Watch on YouTube.]Upstairs in Halsey's room, a fan had sent roses. ""I'm not going to lie; it gets kind of intimidating sometimes,"" she said of the constant attention online and off. ""I put so much of myself out there and make myself so accessible that sometimes I fear I make myself too accessible."" When Halsey offered to get matching tattoos with fans recently as album promotion, those who were not old enough took offense.""I'm giving so much of myself now that there's going to be a point where there's nothing left to give,"" she said while chain-smoking Marlboro 27s. ""I'm on this skyrocket, with all these expectations and this fan base and this buzz. I have blessed myself and cursed myself by building something that people are so attached to. I get one shot.""A month later, at the Brooklyn stop of the Imagine Dragons tour, Halsey was visibly exhausted, having finished ""Badlands"" -- overseeing sound mastering, album art, videos and promo -- while playing arenas. ""My whole body hurts,"" she said backstage.Under the lights, though, she faced the fans' screams gamely, arching her back and spitting water onto those gathered up front for her early set. ""My name is Halsey,"" she told the crowd. ""But I'm not who you guys came here to see."" Even then, that didn't feel quite true.Photograph Halsey in Los Angeles Last Month, Just Before a Performance.

Cameron Plans Rise in Military Spending:   [Foreign Desk ],,"LONDON -- In a significant reversal of British government policy, Prime Minister David Cameron promised on Monday to bolster military spending, ending years of cutbacks that had prompted critics to claim that Britain was retreating from its global role.Announcing the outcome of a defense review, Mr. Cameron told lawmakers that his government would add 12 billion pounds, or about $18 billion, to the defense budget over the next decade, largely for military equipment, adding that such an investment was ""vital at a time when the threats to our country are growing.""The announcement, made 10 days after the terror attacks in France, came on a day in which Mr. Cameron also paid a brief visit to Paris, and promised the French government use of a British air base in Cyprus for France's air campaign in Syria.At present, British bombing raids against the Islamic State are limited to Iraq because of a vote in Parliament in 2013, but on Thursday Mr. Cameron will make the case to extend British airstrikes into Syrian territory.He appears anxious not to lose again on the issue, but with the opposition Labour Party divided over intervention in Syria, Mr. Cameron may decide that he could win a vote before Christmas.In the aftermath of the Paris assaults, Mr. Cameron had already announced plans to increase resources for Britain's intelligence agencies, and to invest in drones and special forces.But the spending plans announced on Monday will increase the broader capabilities of the British armed forces, which -- along with those of France -- are the only ones in Europe with a significant military reach. With the £12 billion increase, the defense equipment budget would rise to £178 billion, or $269 billion over the next decade.Britain's military has been stretched in recent years because of reductions made as the government has sought to stabilize the country's finances after the financial crisis.Those cuts prompted public criticism from Washington that Britain risked playing a reduced international role. Partly in response, London pledged this year to continue to meet a NATO target of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense.That decision set the tone for the defense review, which was published Monday to praise from defense experts.""This is much better for defense and for security than people were anticipating six months ago,"" said Malcolm Chalmers, the research director at the Royal United Services Institute, a research organization.""Over all, the message is that cutbacks have been reversed and some modest, but nevertheless significant, increases in defense and intelligence spending have been made,"" Mr. Chalmers said, adding that the decision signified a trend toward ""more global engagement.""Speaking in Parliament, Mr. Cameron promised to create two new rapidly deployable, 5,000-strong ""strike brigades"" by 2025, and to buy nine maritime patrol aircraft for surveillance, anti-submarine and anti-surface ship warfare. Mr. Cameron added that he would extend the life of the Royal Air Force's Typhoon aircraft for 10 years, to 2040, and stressed that the country faced ""state-based threats"" as well as those from terrorist groups.He also restated his intention to renew the Trident nuclear submarine system, a project which, according to the defense review, would cost £6 billion more than originally planned. Mr. Chalmers noted that the review had been conducted in the context of Russia's display of military assertiveness, which explained the decision to make anti-submarine capabilities a priority.The decisions announced on Monday will change the trajectory in defense expenditure. According to the Royal United Services Institute, government figures show a reduction in defense expenditure, between 2010-11 and 2014-15, from £44.3 billion to £34.4 billion in 2014-15 prices.Maria Eagle, who speaks for the Labour Party on defense issues, said the proposed budget increase would ""not undo the damage to our armed forces caused by the last one, when the government reduced the U.K.'s defense budget by 14.1 percent over the course of the Parliament.""""This is a government which, since coming to office, has left the U.K. with aircraft carriers without aircraft, without maritime patrol and with plummeting morale in our armed forces. We will therefore judge the government by its actions rather than its words,"" she added.Mr. Chalmers said it would be possible only with hindsight to judge whether the correct balance had been struck, and in light of the threats that emerge in the future. ""The test of this review will be in three years from now,"" he added.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

Obama Vows to Keep Doors Open for Refugees:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- President Obama vowed on Saturday to keep America's borders open to the world's refugees ""as long as I'm president,"" even as he met with child migrants and refugees here and his administration refused to yield in a long-distance feud with his critics over the issue.Mr. Obama chatted with elementary-school-age children, all sharply dressed in navy-and-white uniforms, at a humanitarian center that serves young people who have fled violence in Myanmar, Pakistan, Syria, Iran and elsewhere.They were representative of the faces of all the world's persecuted minorities, the president said, adding that such children must not be turned away by countries like the United States because of what he insisted was an unfounded fear of a terrorist threat from their presence.""They were indistinguishable from any child in America,"" Mr. Obama said after kneeling to look at their drawings and math homework. ""And the notion that somehow we would be fearful of them, that our politics would somehow leave us to turn our sights away from their plight, is not representative of the best of who we are.""A 10-day trip by the president to Turkey and Asia has been overshadowed by a relentless clash with governors, lawmakers and Republican presidential candidates about whether to block the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States.In the wake of the terror attacks in Paris, House lawmakers passed bipartisan legislation Thursday to drastically tighten screening for refugees seeking to enter the United States from Syria. Calls for restrictions on Syrian refugees have echoed across the political landscape, from Republican presidential hopefuls and governors to many lawmakers from the president's own party.The president and his aides have condemned what he called on Thursday a ""spasm of rhetoric"" among politicians. He accused Republicans in the United States of cowardice for seeking to block Syrian children and families who are fleeing the violent civil war in their country.""Apparently, they're scared of widows and orphans coming into the United States of America as part of our tradition of compassion,"" Mr. Obama said on Wednesday, adding a moment later: ""That doesn't sound very tough to me.""As Mr. Obama has participated in a series of economic summit meetings on this trip, White House officials have repeatedly sought to emphasize what they say is a comprehensive screening process for Syrian refugees that takes up to two years and includes interviews and biometric data to ensure that terror suspects do not enter the United States.In the president's weekly radio address, taped by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and released on Saturday morning, Mr. Biden insisted that refugees from Syria face ""the most rigorous screening"" of anybody entering the United States.""First they are fingerprinted, then they undergo a thorough background check, then they are interviewed by the Department of Homeland Security,"" Mr. Biden said. ""And after that, the F.B.I., the National Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Defense and the Department of State, they all have to sign off on access.""Administration officials have also sought to change the subject, telling reporters during the president's flight from the Philippines to Malaysia on Friday that the White House was open to discussions with lawmakers about tightening security for a separate program that reduces visa requirements for millions of people visiting the United States from certain countries.But the White House efforts have done little to quell the anxiety back home. The House bill increasing security for the refugee program passed by a vote of 289 to 137, with nearly 50 Democrats supporting it. That is a margin that might allow lawmakers to override Mr. Obama's promised veto if the bill also passes in the Senate.At the Dignity for Children Foundation in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, Mr. Obama knelt to talk to several children as photographers and television cameras captured the broad smiles on their faces.""What's your favorite subject?"" he asked, squatting beside a girl seated on a gray shag rug. ""Do you know what you want to be when you grow up?""The girl said she liked math and wanted to be an engineer when she grew up, prompting Mr. Obama to say, ""You're going to be an excellent engineer.""Most of the children at the center were members of the Rohingya minority who have fled persecution, discrimination and ethnic violence in Myanmar, officials said. White House aides said the United Nations had documented more than 153,000 refugees and asylum seekers in Malaysia, but they said the images of Mr. Obama in the center were designed to highlight the plight of refugees across the globe.In his remarks, the president said he hoped the recent elections in Myanmar, where Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won in a landslide, would help ease the humanitarian crisis in that country. In the meantime, he said, ""The refugees from Myanmar -- again, mostly Rohingya, mostly Muslim -- those young children up there, they're deserving of the world's protection and the world's support.""More broadly, he said, the United States should not turn its back on children from all over the world. He said America's role as a global leader was defined by its willingness to help people who have been discriminated against, tortured or subjected to violence.""That's American leadership,"" Mr. Obama said. ""That's when we're the shining light on the hill. Not when we respond on the basis of fear.""Mr. Obama is scheduled to return to the United States on Monday, when he is likely to face more debate about the refugee issue. He is also scheduled to meet on Tuesday with President François Hollande of France to discuss the terror attacks in Paris.Before leaving Asia, Mr. Obama spent some time on Saturday telling business leaders that the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal negotiated by 12 nations, including the United States, will improve the economy and security of Southeast Asia.Speaking to a business group before heading to the humanitarian center, Mr. Obama said he remained confident that Congress would approve the deal. And he said that nations in Asia should quickly do the same.""T.P.P. is more than just a trade pact; it also has important strategic and geopolitical benefits,"" he said. ""T.P.P. is a long-term investment in our shared security and in universal human rights.""""With T.P.P., we're not only writing the rules for trade in the Asia Pacific, we also have an historic opportunity to shape the future of the global economy,"" he said, adding: ""It says that America's foreign policy rebalance to the Asia Pacific will continue on every front.""Photograph President Obama with Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung of Vietnam at a Meeting in Malaysia.

Review: Dej Loaf Releases '#AndSeeThatsTheThing':   [Review ],,"DEJ LOAF""#AndSeeThatsTheThing""(Columbia)Every year since 2010 at the BET Awards, Nicki Minaj has been named best female hip-hop artist because, well, let's just say hip-hop has long been inhospitable to female talent in all its varieties. Simply to be heard, it can take exceptional gifts, like those possessed by Ms. Minaj. She is indisputably great, and in this particular arena, indisputably alone. During her acceptance speech this year, she acknowledged her fellow nominees, but focused on one newcomer, Dej Loaf, saying, ""You've been very, very interesting to me, and super, super forward.""Sixteen women have lost to Ms. Minaj in that category, but this was the first year when there was even a credible contender for runner-up. Dej Loaf, from Detroit, has a child's voice, round and small and not yet firm. Her breakthrough single, ""Try Me,"" which was released last year, sounded like getting threatened by a particularly needling child. ""I might catch a body,"" she sing-rapped, and it swung like a do-si-so.Since then, Dej Loaf has become a refreshingly chameleonic presence in hip-hop, slithering through songs about mean-mugging and songs about sweet loving. Her new EP, ""#AndSeeThatsTheThing"" -- her first major-label release of new material -- has some of both, her saccharine voice sometimes blurring the lines between them. (When she's rapping alone, her sneering is most alluring: gritty songs like ""Desire"" and ""We Winnin' "" easily outshine simple love declarations like ""Butterflies."")Most of the time, her soft and stretchy voice is spread atop oozing, shimmery production, and manipulated by machines; it's a toy to be fiddled with and molded. She meets her match here on ""Hey There,"" a hazy, undeniably sweet duet (produced by iRocksays with J. Vaughn & the A-Team) with Future. He, too, uses technology to extract deeper meaning from his voice. Together, they're like robots finally achieving sentience, androids melting into flesh and blood.Being a female rapper invariably means all manner of collaborations with men, many unwelcome and retrograde, but Dej Loaf has consistently used those opportunities to show new sides of herself, whether adding spooky kiddie menace to Kid Ink's ""Be Real"" or ride-or-die insouciance to the remix of Lil Durk's ""What You Do to Me."" But she has never been more impressive than on the remix of Omarion's ""Post to Be,"" one of this year's most salacious songs, and one on which Dej Loaf finally blends her aggression and her sensuality, asserting, ""I'm a pimp by blood, ain't no coaching me,"" and later, cleverly shrugging, ""I just got a checkup and ain't no ho in me.""On this EP, the duets are more balanced, be it ""Hey There"" or the rising hit ""Back Up,"" a back-and-forth with Big Sean. Both rappers are from Detroit, and the quickstepping song samples DJ Clent's ""Back Up Off Me,"" a ghetto house and juke anthem that was the first release on the Michigan label Juke Trax. Big Sean is a whimsical, witty rapper, and while Dej Loaf can't quite match his energy, she's happy to double his attitude: ""You got to promise not to stress me/ Don't be blowing up my phone and don't be leaving voice messages.""Photograph Photo",0.0
Comments:   [Travel Desk ],,"Early this month, several airplane passengers in Los Angeles who had boarded a Spirit Airlines flight to Dallas were kicked off the plane after an exchange over a seat that had been double-booked. (The passengers say the decision was racially motivated; the airline says it's looking into the matter.)Hundreds of readers had a lot to say about being kicked off a plane and about flying in general. Below are edited excerpts from their choicest comments.As airlines have forced passengers into smaller spaces and turned flying into a physical test of endurance, more passengers have gotten thrown off planes or otherwise become confrontational and angry. If I put you in a box and poke you with a stick enough times, what do you expect? What's changed in the last five years, airlines or humans?RYAN NEW YORKI've seen passengers behave with appalling rudeness toward flight attendants, and I've seen flight attendants on obvious power trips. But I don't think the problem is a general lack of manners in our society. The root of the problem is that everyone involved in a flight is stressed from overbooking and lack of personal space. Flying is miserable because more discomfort equals more profit. It doesn't excuse individual bad behavior, but when you make conditions more and more uncomfortable for people, it's inevitable that some of them will lash out at whoever's around them. Airline executives must have a good laugh as passengers argue about whether flight attendants or other passengers are to blame.BLUELOTUS LOS ANGELESMy mother was once seated in a seat where the previous passenger had had a urine accident. Her backside was completely wet. When she asked to switch seats, the flight attendants refused, so she stood at the front of her aisle and explained what happened in a voice that could be heard by other passengers on the plane. The airline threatened to eject her if she did not take the soiled seat. Thankfully, another passenger found her an empty seat, but I've always wondered whether the airline/flight attendants actually had the right to eject her in this situation.CRANE ANN ARBOR, MICH.I was traveling with 3-year-old twins when my son decided he didn't like his seatbelt. Nothing I did or said could help him understand that he had to keep it on. At the time, I didn't know that he had a serious hearing impairment and probably couldn't hear anything over the sound of the engines. I was eventually escorted off two different flights that day, which included enduring unbelievable hostility from other passengers. I am an extremely experienced traveler, but nothing prepared me for this. I would love to see airlines and passengers demonstrate some compassion toward parents. I now go out of my way to help any parent I see struggling in a plane or airport. I hope you will, too.AMANDA HARTFORDHaving flown in commercial airlines quite a bit, I have learned the following:1. Compliment the flight attendants. You'll get extra cookies or drinks.2. Behave, be polite and keep your mouth shut.3. Help women, older passengers and those with physical limitations with their luggage or other needs if it's convenient.4. Be patient. You'll all get there at the same time.All this works!DAVE ATLANTAAs a gate agent for a major airline, I've had to remove passengers from a plane. It's lousy for everyone involved. All I can say is, whatever got you to the point of being taken off a flight, it will not be resolved on the airplane. Once the flight crew and/or the gate agents have made their decision, you're off. The decision may change back at the gate, but that is unlikely. The only thing that will help you is to remain calm. Far, far easier said than done, especially in a cramped aluminum tube, but raised voices, belligerence and insults only hurt your case. Just be responsible, own your behavior, apologize for what you said or did (or what your mother would know) that was wrong, and be part of the solution, even if the airline/flight crew/agents made mistakes or a bad call.And this, too, applies to airline employees. I don't like to eat crow either, but my professionalism demands I admit my mistakes and make amends as best I can. Believe it or not, most of us in the industry love our work, and it distresses us when our passengers are unhappy. We want to help, but you have to help us help you!NICK MONTANAPhotograph Airline Passengers, Like These On an Allegiant Airlines Flight, Are Feeling More Stress, As Are the Crews.

France's Ambassador Has Shiny Cuff Links but Also Sharp Teeth:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- In the hours after the terrorist attacks in Paris left 130 dead, Gérard Araud, the French ambassador to the United States, thanked all Americans for their solidarity except for one: Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate who pointedly said that the mass shootings had occurred in ""one of the toughest gun control countries in the world.""Mr. Araud promptly pronounced Mr. Trump a ""vulture"" on Twitter. ""This message is repugnant in its lack of any human decency,"" he told his 27,500 followers.Mr. Araud deleted the post within an hour, deciding, he later said, that it was not the time for such sparring. But he makes no apology for the sentiment or the way he expressed it -- the latest example of how France's top diplomat in the United States relishes tossing out protocol when the interests of his country are at stake.""I'm a fighter, which for an ambassador is unusual, so I retaliated,"" Mr. Araud said this week during an interview in the Winter Salon of the grand Tudor Revival mansion that is his residence in Washington. ""I did it because it was just at the moment of the attack, so I was totally disgusted. I'm absolutely not ashamed of what I said.""Mr. Araud, 62, the first openly gay French ambassador to Washington and quintessentially French down to his (sterling silver) cuff links, relishes showing off his country's cuisine and culture at parties that bring together the city's top politicians, academics, business leaders, artists and writers. But he is the antithesis of a buttoned-up diplomat issuing scripted statements of harmony.Instead he is known as an effective and sometimes combative advocate for France.""He's a very talented, intelligent ambassador who serves his country well, but he knows how to throw an elbow,"" an Obama administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about Mr. Araud. ""On occasion, that has caused brief moments of friction.""He can be a strong negotiator, as was the case during intensive talks earlier this year between Iran and six world powers, including the United States and France, on a deal to lift sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbing its nuclear program. Mr. Araud criticized the emerging agreement, suggesting it was not tough enough, and publicly questioned whether a deadline at the end of June for striking it was binding. His words undercut what American negotiators regarded as critical leverage at the most sensitive of moments.""That was directly contrary to what we wanted to do, and it was unhelpful,"" said Philip Gordon, who until March was the top Middle East official at the National Security Council. But in an era when the United States and France have mostly common interests and have been aligned on strategic issues, he added, the bluntness can also be an asset.""He is refreshingly candid, and I stress 'refreshing,' because often diplomats can be quite cautious and ultra-diplomatic,"" Mr. Gordon said. ""I don't think anyone would say that about Gérard.""A former French ambassador to Israel, Mr. Araud's tenure in Washington has been punctuated by tragedy. He had been in the post only four months when masked gunmen stormed the Paris offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people.It was after that January attack that Mr. Trump originally sent the tweet about France's gun control laws, a message that was recycled in the wake of this month's carnage, provoking Mr. Araud's irate response. (Mr. Trump repeated the point after the latest attacks, during a speech Nov. 14 in Beaumont, Texas.)When he left his post as his country's ambassador to the United Nations to come to Washington, Mr. Araud worried on Twitter that his new assignment would compel him to ""be much more restrained."" Jeb Bush campaign officials might now see that as a needless concern.Last month when Mr. Bush remarked during a Republican presidential debate that the Senate's three-day schedule was akin to a ""French workweek,"" Mr. Araud was quick with a retort.""A French workweek of 3 days? No but a pregnancy paid leave of 16 weeks yes! And proud of it,"" he tweeted, later adding statistics pinpointing the French average of 39.6 hours per week of work. He called Mr. Bush's assertions ""bombastic nonsense.""Mr. Araud -- in between security briefings, receiving condolences for the victims, appearing in television interviews to talk about France's response to the attacks and planning for a hastily scheduled visit to the White House on Tuesday by President François Hollande of France -- has also taken time over the past week to comment on People magazine's selection of David Beckham as the sexiest man alive.""The only reason I see that I didn't make it is that he has more tattoos than me,"" he said on Twitter.At his residence in the Kalorama neighborhood of Northwest Washington, where classical portraits of the Marquis de Lafayette and the Count de Rochambeau mingle with modern canvases and photographs by his longtime partner, Pascal Blondeau, Mr. Araud said being outspoken on Twitter is part of being an effective ambassador in 2015.""It's in a way trying to reach more people, and also different people, and I try to do it in an engaging way,"" said Mr. Araud, who usually tweets from his car -- he has a driver -- or during the 15 minutes before he goes to sleep each evening.""I'm not worried about the consequence,"" he added, noting that he has long said the posting to Washington will be his last.He has little to lose, having risen to the highest echelons of French diplomacy. At the United Nations, where he served from 2009 to 2014, he embodied France's outsized influence as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, using the perch to cudgel and shame.He pushed for a vote on a measure to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court, knowing Russia would veto it, which was exactly the point -- to isolate the Kremlin. He goaded the United States to support an expensive peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic, where no country but France has any strategic interest.As a top foreign ministry official in Paris from 2006 to 2009, Mr. Araud was the lead negotiator on Iran for France, leaning on Russia to support new sanctions against Tehran for its nuclear activity, something Moscow resisted but ultimately backed.""What's really special about him is he's passionate, and in the sometimes dry world of diplomacy, where everyone's emotions are in check, Gérard can get passionate in a meeting, and he can get angry, and it's very effective,"" said R. Nicholas Burns, a former top State Department official in the George W. Bush administration who coordinated with Mr. Araud and officials from Britain, Germany, China and Russia in the nuclear effort. ""He was a tough inside player in holding that coalition together.""In the interview, Mr. Araud said he took no pleasure in offending his American counterparts or other colleagues, whether through a tweet or in the course of diplomatic maneuvering.""If I ever did it,"" Mr. Araud said with a faint smile, ""it was a mistake of my side, you know.""Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.",0.0

"Clinton Assails Bush, in Possible Trailer for '16:   [National Desk ]",,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Jeb Bush and his aides had envisioned a big, inclusive, high-minded speech about race on Friday in his home state of Florida, a chance to bring his message of colorblind opportunity to a prestigious group of African-American leaders.In a rare gesture of bipartisanship, Mr. Bush even planned to warmly quote President Obama, usually the object of his derision.Then Hillary Rodham Clinton stomped all over those plans.In a biting surprise attack, delivered as Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, waited backstage here at the annual convention of the National Urban League, Mrs. Clinton portrayed him as a hypocrite who had set back the cause of black Americans.It was an unexpected moment of political theater that seemed to presage what could be a bitter general-election rivalry between two of the biggest names in American politics.Mrs. Clinton, a Democratic candidate for president, latched onto Mr. Bush's campaign slogan and the name of his ""super PAC"" --Right to Rise, his shorthand for a conservative agenda of self-reliance and hope -- and turned it into a verbal spear.""People can't rise if they can't afford health care,"" Mrs. Clinton said to applause from conventiongoers, a dig at Mr. Bush's opposition to the Affordable Care Act.""They can't rise if the minimum wage is too low to live on,"" she said, a jab at his opposition to raising the federal minimum wage.""They can't rise if their governor makes it harder for them to get a college education,"" she said, a critique of Mr. Bush's decision as governor to eliminate affirmative action in college admissions.When Mr. Bush reached the lectern, declaring, ""I believe in the right to rise in this country,"" the scent of political gunpowder was still in the air.The assault on her Republican rival was all the more striking because the Bush and Clinton families make a point of highlighting their friendly ties: Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush appear on this week's cover of Time magazine.Mr. Bush appeared unprepared to respond, thanking Mrs. Clinton for joining him at the event but otherwise leaving her criticism unanswered in his own speech.Mr. Bush's aides, however, could barely hide their disgust over Mrs. Clinton's remarks, which they spoke of, bitterly, as uncivil and uncalled-for.On Twitter, Tim Miller, Mr. Bush's communications director, called it a ""Clintonesque move to pass over chance to unite in favor of a false cheap shot.""Allie Brandenburger, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, followed up with an email saying, ""The Urban League deserved better.""Despite the broadsides from Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Bush's speech was well received. He won applause when he recalled his decision to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the Florida Capitol in 2001. And he spoke emotionally of the massacre of nine black parishioners in Charleston, S.C., in June and of the forgiveness their survivors had expressed for the man charged in the shooting.""In the community of that city, we found such grace, such purity of heart, such heroic goodness, such boundless mercy, all gathered up in one story,"" Mr. Bush said.He quoted both the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mr. Obama. ""When President Obama says that 'for too long, we've been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present,' he is speaking the truth,"" Mr. Bush said to applause.But he did not directly address the rash of police shootings of unarmed black men that dominated discussions at the Urban League conference this week. Instead, he called more obliquely for rebuilding trust in ""America's vital institutions.""""That happens,"" he said, ""one person at a time. One politician at a time. One police officer at a time.""In her remarks, Mrs. Clinton took a more direct approach, ticking off the names of African-Americans who have died after interactions with law enforcement -- including Eric Garner, Walter L. Scott and Freddie Gray -- to knowing nods in the audience.""These names are emblazoned on our hearts,"" she said. ""We've seen their faces; we've heard their grieving families.""She spoke explicitly about racial discrimination, saying it still played a major role in determining ""who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind.""She added: ""We can't go on like this. We are better than this. Things must change.""Toward the end of her speech, Mrs. Clinton turned to those who, in her telling, do not live up to their own words on the subject of racial injustice, singling out Mr. Bush, not by name but by implication, over and over.Those attending the Urban League conference, who lean Democratic, took notice.Cherie LaCour-Duckworth, a Clinton supporter, said she had paid little attention to what Mr. Bush said. Mrs. Clinton, she said, ""set the stage for him.""Norma Richards, who traveled to the conference from Ohio, said she was struck by Mr. Bush's decision to talk about race so indirectly. ""He wasn't really strong about social injustice,"" she said.But her real objection to Mr. Bush, she said, stemmed from the presidential contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000, in which Florida played a decisive role. ""They stole the election,"" she said. ""I can't get that out of my head.""The conference Friday had offered a chance for Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who is challenging Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic nomination and has generated a loyal following among white liberals, to appeal more directly to black voters. But his speech highlighted just how much work he still has to do.At one point, Mr. Sanders begged for the crowd's indulgence to discuss his campaign platform before focusing on the ""save our cities"" subject of the gathering. But he called that ""your theme"" -- an off-key remark, and one that echoed a speech he made on Thursday, in which he twice referred to Latinos as ""your people"" before the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.Ben Carson, a Republican who was the sole black candidate to speak here, took a tough-love approach that seemed to inspire little enthusiasm from the crowd. Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, never mentioned the high-profile deaths of unarmed black men and women in police custody and held himself up as a model of how ambition and education could rescue poor African-Americans from poverty.He called on black parents to talk to their sons ""about how they conduct themselves.""""If you conduct yourselves in certain ways,"" he said, ""you are going to run into trouble, not only with law enforcement but with the guy down the block.""Herman Wallace, an attendee from Kansas City, Mo., was unmoved. ""Carson,"" he said, ""talked about himself.""Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.Photograph Above, Jeb Bush Addressed the National Urban League Conference On Friday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

Children Caught in a Racist System:   [Editorial ],,"The Justice Department cast the St. Louis County, Mo., law enforcement system in a harrowing light in March when it documented entrenched racism and unconstitutional policing in the town of Ferguson, which erupted in riots last year after a white police officer killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager.Now comes another Justice Department report, issued last week, documenting equally deplorable violations in the county's juvenile court system, where children, often without basic legal representation, are routinely railroaded and mistreated.The department opened the investigation in 2013 to protect the constitutional rights of children in the justice system and to discourage unnecessary incarceration. The department has undertaken similar investigations in Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas.In St. Louis County, officials examined 33,000 juvenile court cases over a three-year period and found that the system regularly treats black children more harshly than white children and routinely denies indigent children -- no matter their race -- basic constitutional rights.After controlling for relevant factors, including the severity of the offenses involved, a Justice Department analysis found that ""black children are subjected to harsher treatment because of their race."" For example, black children were two-and-a-half times as likely as white children to be held in custody before their trials.Black children were also more likely to be placed in the custody of the juvenile system than white children were and less likely to be diverted into community-based programs. White children were significantly more likely to get less restrictive sentences, like probation with services provided to them at home. This disparate treatment may not be intentional, but it is clearly racist in its effect.The Supreme Court has ruled that states must provide lawyers to defendants who can't afford them and that juveniles have the same rights as adults. But the very structure of St. Louis County's family court system seems designed to deny due process and representation.The children who go before the court do not get a truly independent advocate who looks after their interests. Investigators found that low-income children, who are legally entitled to court-appointed representation, are shortchanged at every turn.For starters, there is only one public defender for juveniles in the entire county. A result is a staggering caseload for that one lawyer, who cannot possibly meet the needs of hundreds of children. For some who are not eligible for the public defender's services, a family court judge will appoint a lawyer and order the parents to pay a ""retainer""; often, cash-strapped parents persuade a child that no lawyer is necessary. Moreover, more than half of the lawyers who represented detained children entered the cases many days or weeks after the child's detention hearing -- too late to be of much help.This appalling situation means that many juveniles are essentially representing themselves in complex legal proceedings that typically require them to plead guilty. Some of these children face the possibility of being transferred to adult courts, where a guilty verdict could have lifelong consequences. This is inconsistent with the Constitution and with basic principles of human decency.The report offers dozens of recommendations for remaking this egregious system, starting with developing a strategic plan that sets clear goals to end discriminatory treatment at all points. As part of that process, the court has to train its employees to understand ""the subtle ways that racial bias, conscious or unconscious,"" affects policy and practice, the report says.One absolutely essential step is for the county to create a defense system for poor juveniles that passes constitutional muster and affords them access to competent representation. The Justice Department should haul the county into court if it fails to make these changes.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",0.0
"In Rebuke to Kirchner, Argentines Elect Opposition Figure as President:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BUENOS AIRES -- Argentine voters handed a victory to Mauricio Macri in the country's presidential election on Sunday, delivering a mandate to an opposition political figure seeking to roll back some of the protectionist economic measures of the departing president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.With votes from 99 percent of polling places counted, Mr. Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires and a former president of Boca Juniors, one of Argentina's most popular soccer teams, was leading with 51.4 percent of the vote, according to election officials, against 48.5 percent for Daniel Scioli, a former speedboat racer and vice president under former President Néstor Kirchner, who died in 2010. Mr. Scioli conceded defeat on national television on Sunday night.Running a largely nonconfrontational campaign in a society that has grown increasingly polarized under Mrs. Kirchner, who succeeded her husband in 2007, Mr. Macri, 56, stunned the political establishment in October by forcing the race into a runoff and maintaining his surge in recent weeks. He ran to the right of his rivals, blending plans to overhaul the economy and promote the tolerance of various points of view on social issues.Mr. Macri's relatively narrow victory revealed deep fissures in Argentina after 12 years of governance by Mrs. Kirchner and her husband, with many voters expressing concern over the direction of the economy and frustration with Mrs. Kirchner's blistering attacks on critics in the news media, business establishments and rival political parties.""Cristina divided the country and destroyed it morally,"" said Dimitri Javakhishvili, 67, an immigrant from Georgia who works as a doorman at a building here in the neighborhood of Recoleta. Mr. Javakhishvili acknowledged that Mr. Macri could face challenges in trying to govern when Mrs. Kirchner's political movement moves into the opposition.Still, Mr. Javakhishvili said, ""At least he's something new; he's something fresh.""Not everyone here shares such views. Graffiti and posters have appeared across Buenos Aires demonizing Mr. Macri, outnumbering on many streets the campaign posters expressing support for Mr. Scioli, who balanced lukewarm support from Mrs. Kirchner's loyal followers with claims that social spending could be sustained despite galloping inflation and declining private investment.One example of anti-Macri sentiment, alluding to fears that he will govern for a privileged few, simply says ""Macrisis.""Mr. Macri, the scion of a wealthy family, has tried to combat perceptions that he would reverse the government's leftist policies, saying he will keep the nationalized companies like Aerolíneas Argentinas and YPF, Argentina's largest oil company, under state control. His economic advisers have also sought to tamp down fears around contentious economic issues like a potential currency devaluation.In addition to grappling with inflation and currency controls aimed at curbing capital flight, Mr. Macri will now face the challenge of governing with much of his opposition under the sway of Peronism, the ideologically diverse political grouping that has dominated Argentine politics for decades.Yet while Mrs. Kirchner's leftist faction has emerged as a dominant group within Peronism, with the president herself signaling that she planned to remain politically active after stepping down in December, Mr. Macri's margin of victory will help him in the months ahead, analysts said.""He will be able to start to work with authority,"" said Juan Cruz Díaz, a director at the Cefeidas Group, a political risk analysis firm. But he added that Mr. Scioli's performance still demonstrated the underlying strength of the Peronist political movement. ""It's not a devastating margin of difference,"" Mr. Díaz said. ""With a fatigued government and an erratic campaign, it's a good performance. They are far from dead.""Many political analysts in Argentina doubted that Mr. Macri would make it this far, with skepticism abounding when he began assembling his movement to the right of many rivals more than a decade ago.He ventured into a part of Argentina's political spectrum that had previously been associated with conservative Peronists or disgraced figures in the military establishment.But over time, he honed his negotiating skills as the mayor of Buenos Aires, while insisting during this year's campaign that he did not plan to roll back popular social programs introduced during the Kirchners' presidencies, like cash subsidies for poor families and ""Soccer for Everybody,"" a government initiative that covers soccer broadcasting fees so people can watch matches free.Mr. Macri seemed to gain the upper hand after mounting a door-to-door campaign that helped his supporters win important provincial and local races in October, including the prized post of the governor of Buenos Aires Province, now held by Mr. Scioli but won by María Eugenia Vidal, a top adviser to Mr. Macri and deputy mayor who focused largely on antipoverty programs in the municipal government.Many voters have also expressed fatigue with Mrs. Kirchner's governing style and reports of corruption among her prominent supporters.Signaling that she may not plan to remain subdued after leaving office, Mrs. Kirchner issued a torrent of messages on Twitter on Sunday celebrating her foreign and domestic policies. One message even seemed like a warning to Mr. Macri, who has vowed to improve Argentina's strained ties with the United States and review a contentious deal with China to build a nuclear reactor.""The person with the responsibility of leading the homeland should know the right place of the Argentine republic in a multipolar world,"" Mrs. Kirchner wrote.Mr. Macri's ""wager wasn't an easy one,"" the Argentine writer Martín Caparrós wrote in the Spanish newspaper El País. But Mr. Macri's ambitions were aided, Mr. Caparrós said, by ""12 years of rule by a couple that spoke as if from the left but acted in their own interests.""Some voters, however, said that their fears over the threats to the government's antipoverty programs outweighed criticism of the Kirchners or concerns that Mr. Scioli, viewed as friendlier to the business establishment, was not as radical as they had hoped.""I'm voting for the lesser of two evils,"" said Teo Levín, 25, a medical student who explained that he was voting for Mr. Scioli with gritted teeth. ""I understand that Scioli will adopt come conservative economic policies, but he won't destroy the political model. Macri will. He's the worst thing in the world.""Photograph Supporters of the Presidential Candidate Mauricio Macri Cheered in Buenos Aires On Sunday.

"Taiwan: Six Prisoners Kill Themselves, Official Says:   [Brief ]",,"Six inmates at a prison in southern Taiwan killed themselves Thursday morning, ending an overnight hostage situation, a Justice Ministry official said. Two prison staff members were released unharmed after being held for 14 hours at the Kaohsiung Prison, said the official, Chen Ming-tang, a vice minister in the Justice Ministry. The six inmates, who were all serving lengthy terms for crimes that included drug trafficking and murder, apparently complained about their living conditions to get a meeting with prison officials, whom they then took hostage on Wednesday, according to local news reports. The inmates later took firearms from a prison armory, Taiwan's Central News Agency reported. Taiwanese news outlets broadcast a series of demands from the men, including that they be provided with vehicles and that former President Chen Shui-bian, who was convicted of embezzlement and taking bribes in 2009, be returned to prison. Mr. Chen was released on medical parole in January. But early Thursday, the six inmates shot themselves, Mr. Chen, the ministry official, said in a brief televised interview. He provided few details about the episode.",0.0
"Paid Notice: Deaths CARRINGTON, KATHLEEN:   [Paid Death Notice ]",,"CARRINGTON--Kathleen. Kathleen Connell Carrington, 88, passed away peacefully on November 7, 2015 in Greenville, South Carolina. Kay, as she was known by her friends and family, was a steadfast and loving wife and mother. Born January 11, 1927 in Jersey City, New Jersey to John Norman Connell and Helen Burke Connell, Kay was one of nine children. Beautiful and unassuming, with an easy sense of humor and disarming smile, Kay graduated from Notre Dame College in Baltimore soon after the Second World War. Shortly thereafter she married Jim Carrington, a three-sport All-American, at the U.S. Naval Academy. In what has been described as a fairytale wedding, the midshipmen in their dress-whites rained rice upon the stunningly beautiful newlyweds as they ran beneath a shining arc of crossed sabers. Kay taught school until the arrival of the first of her five children, whom she raised in or near seaports around the world, from Yokosuka, Japan to Annapolis, Maryland. Like most Navy wives, while her husband was away at sea, often for months at a time, she stoically ran the householdwithout ever a complaint. Kay and Jim taught their children a great deal, but perhaps their most precious legacy was setting an example of how wonderful a marriage can be. As irony would have it, in the precise moment of Kay's sudden passing, all her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren were gathered together in California for the marriage of her grandson Michael. The thought would have pleased her to no end. Kay is survived by her daughters, Wendy Carrington, Nancy (Steve) Crown, and Kathleen (Steven) Anderson; sons, James Carrington, Jr., and Timothy (Cathleen) Carrington; sisters, Shelly Cullen, Madeleine Reilly, Elizabeth De Souza; brother, James Connell; ten grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews. She was preceded in death by her parents; husband James H.H. Carrington; sisters, Elise Leahy, Mary Lou Towey, and Nancy Bockus; brother, Jack Connell; and daughter-in-law Antonella Murgia Carrington. A service celebrating Kay's life is being planned for the spring of 2016.

WHY does the pro-choice movement so often find itself in a defensive crouch?I cringed as I watched Planned Parenthood's president, Cecile Richards, apologize in a YouTube video last month for the lack of ""compassion"" in two doctors' language at supposed business lunches arranged and secretly recorded by the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress.Not because she wasn't eloquent, but because of what her words said about the impossibly narrow path abortion providers now are forced to walk. After all, have you ever heard an apology from a crisis pregnancy center for masquerading as an abortion clinic? What about the women in Texas who lost access to gynecological care when the state defunded Planned Parenthood and did not, as promised, adequately replace its services? Has anyone said sorry about that?Logically, it's not important how doctors talk at supposedly private meetings. If they were heart surgeons I doubt it would be an issue. But these are abortion providers, and that makes all the difference. So far, the surreptitiously filmed videos, five of which have now been released, do not, as claimed, show that Planned Parenthood sells fetal tissue for profit, which is against the law.But the videos do cleverly evoke visceral feelings of disgust -- graphic images, physicians using the words ""crush"" and ""crunchy"" -- to activate the stereotype that abortion providers are money-grubbing baby killers.Why women end up having second trimester abortions, why they choose to donate fetal tissue, what good the research achieves -- who cares, when there is outrage to provoke and express?There are two reasons abortion rights activists have been boxed in. One is that we've been reactive rather than proactive. To deflect immediate attacks, we fall in with messaging that unconsciously encodes the vision of the other side. Abortion opponents say women seek abortions in haste and confusion. Pro-choicers reply: Abortion is the most difficult, agonizing decision a woman ever makes. Opponents say: Women have abortions because they have irresponsible sex. We say: rape, incest, fatal fetal abnormalities, life-risking pregnancies.These responses aren't false exactly. Some women are genuinely ambivalent; some pregnancies are particularly dangerous. But they leave out a large majority of women seeking abortions, who had sex willingly, made a decision to end the pregnancy and faced no special threatening medical conditions.We need to say that women have sex, have abortions, are at peace with the decision and move on with their lives. We need to say that is their right, and, moreover, it's good for everyone that they have this right: The whole society benefits when motherhood is voluntary. When we gloss over these truths we unintentionally promote the very stigma we're trying to combat. What, you didn't agonize? You forgot your pill? You just didn't want to have a baby now? You should be ashamed of yourself.The second reason we're stuck in a defensive mode is that too many pro-choice people are way too quiet. According to the Guttmacher Institute, nearly one in three women will have had at least one abortion by the time she reaches menopause. I suspect most of those women had someone who helped them, too -- a husband or boyfriend, a friend, a parent. Where are those people? The couple who decided two kids were enough, the grad student who didn't want to be tied for life to an ex-boyfriend, the woman barely getting by on a fast-food job? Why don't we hear more from them?It's not that they think they did something wrong: A recent study published in the journal PLOS One finds that more than 95 percent of women felt the abortion was the right decision, both immediately after the procedure and three years later. They've been shamed into silence by stigma. Abortion opponents are delighted to fill that silence with testimony from their own ranks: the tiny minority of women who say they're plagued by regret, rape victims glad they chose to continue their pregnancies, women who rejected their doctor's advice to end a pregnancy and -- look at these adorable baby pictures! -- everything turned out fine.Make no mistake: Those voices are heard in high places. In his 2007 Supreme Court decision upholding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy specifically mentioned the ""unexceptionable"" likelihood that a woman might come to regret her choice. That women need to be protected from decisions they might feel bad about later -- not that there was any evidence supporting this notion -- is now a legal precedent.It is understandable that women who have ended pregnancies just wanted to move on. Why should they define themselves publicly by one private decision, perhaps made long ago? I'll tell you why: because the pro-choice movement cannot flourish if the mass of women it serves -- that one in three -- look on as if the struggle has nothing to do with them. Without the voices and support of millions of ordinary women behind them, providers and advocates can be too easily dismissed as ideologues out of touch with the American people.Women aren't the only ones who need to speak up. Where are the men grateful not to be forced into fatherhood? Where are the doctors who object to the way anti-abortion lawmakers are interfering with the practice of medicine?On the issue of fetal-tissue research, we need to hear loud and clear from the scientific community. Anti-abortion activists are calling for a ban on this research, which ironically is used primarily to find treatments for sick babies. Will scientists let that happen?Planned Parenthood is big. It estimates that one in five women have visited its clinics for health care. But the implications of the video sting, and the congressional scrutiny Planned Parenthood now faces, are even bigger. They're about whether Americans will let anti-abortion extremists control the discourse and dictate the agenda around reproductive rights, medicine and scientific research. Silence, fear, shame, stigma. That's what they're counting on. Will enough of us come forward to win back the ground we've been losing?",0.0
"Quiet Time With Family, Food and Phone:   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"When Liz Lange's real estate broker sent her the rental listing for Grey Gardens, the famed East Hampton estate, her eyes nearly popped out. Ms. Lange, a fashion designer who sold her maternity-wear business in 2007 but remains its creative director, had long been captivated by the decaying mansion and its eccentric former residents, Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter, Edie, who were immortalized in a 1975 documentary and who are also the subjects of a 2006 Broadway musical being revived this month at the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor. Ms. Lange was also obsessed with the house's subsequent renovation by the journalists Sally Quinn and Ben Bradlee. ""There's history in that house,"" she said. She rented it, and Ms. Lange, 48, who lives on the Upper East Side, is spending extended weekends at Grey Gardens this summer with her fiancé, a lawyer; her children, Gus, 16, and Alice, 14; and their Goldendoodle, Rosie.ELECTRONIC SLIDE I sleep tethered to my phone. I put it, actually, under my pillow. I get up around 6. I slide out my phone, I start answering emails. I know people think it's bad, but truthfully, I feel like since I started my business, customers are everything. Maybe Target customers, who we call ""guests,"" maybe they have questions. I love to answer them all personally. I'm not going to pretend that I don't stay on it all day -- I do.HOT DIP I can't really start my day unless I take a bath. I do it a lot during the day. They're very quick. Someone once called me ""the human tea bag"" because I get in, I get out. I like scalding hot, but just for a minute.MUFFIN RUN I'm a baked-goods fanatic. There's this bakery in Wainscott -- it's called Levain. They have incredible blueberry muffins. They make a certain amount in the morning. People line up out the door. So I run out to Levain in my car, which I love to do because I never drive in the city.SUN-FILLED NOOK There's this incredible sunroom with all glass doors leading to the gardens. I like to sit in that sunroom. Often my fiancé will join me. We'll read the papers, we'll eat muffins, we'll have coffee. At a certain point, the kids will wake up. I'm not such a great cook but I do this thing where I make my daughter and her friends homemade crepes. I even bought this special crepe maker.BOOKS, FAMILY My fiancé and I will take Rosie on a walk. We often run into people. To me, New York and East Hampton are like a small little village. My sister and her husband and their children, who are best friends with my children, are in Amagansett. Sometimes we'll go there for lunch. I might be reading, checking my emails, checking my Instagram feed, commenting on things. I read for fun. I devour books.CITY BOUND When we are home in time, we go to Sette Mezzo for dinner. It's almost like our second kitchen. I have been going there on Sunday nights -- first with my parents and sister, and now with my fiancé and children -- since I was a child. My entire family goes as often as we do, so I'll usually run into a cousin or an aunt.HAPPY PLACE Around 10, I get into bed. I'll start binge TV-watching, which I can do until 1 in the morning. I'm obsessed with cheesy -- especially the ones that were made a long time ago, Lifetime and Hallmark movies. Obsessed. My favorite thing is when there's an actor who's become famous. There's one about a gay man coming out. It's called ""Doing Time on Maple Drive."" Jim Carrey is in it and I love Jim Carrey. That's my happy place. My pillows are propped up, I'm scrolling through my DVR, I've got my laptop on my lap and I've got my phone next to me.WORKING FOR THE WEEKDAY I can't imagine my life not working; I love it. I'm very excited for Monday morning to come. I think if you saw me walking down the street, wouldn't you think, ""I have nothing in common with her. She's a primate of Park Avenue?"" I'm not. I've worked since I was 21. My children always tease me and say, ""You have no friends, Mom."" I'm kind of a workaholic. I don't do a lot of turnoff.#SundayRoutine readers can follow Liz Lange on Twitter @lizlange or on Instagram @lizlangeofficial.Photograph (Photographs by Nicole Bengiveno/the New York Times)",0.0

"When Bad Guys Escape, Cops Brood:   [Review ]",,"THE WHITESBy Richard Price writing as Harry Brandt333 pages. Henry Holt and Company. $28.""The Whites,"" the title of Richard Price's riveting new novel, is a reference to the great white whale in ""Moby-Dick"" -- a book that seems to be a kind of touchstone for the author (writing here under the pen name Harry Brandt), having popped up, at least glancingly, in such earlier novels as ""Clockers"" and ""Freedomland."" This time, the parallels to Melville's classic are beyond obvious: All of the story's main characters are haunted by something terrible that happened in the past, and all are obsessed with hunting down their nemeses.These characters are all cops or former cops (who, ""starting out in the late '90s, had christened themselves the ""Wild Geese""), and as Mr. Price has demonstrated in his earlier novels and episodes of the HBO show ""The Wire,"" he not only has a visceral ability to convey the gritty, day-to-day realities of their jobs, but also a knack for using their detective work the way John le Carré has used spy stories and tradecraft, as a framework on which to build complex investigations into the human soul.The story architecture here is based on these characters' Ahab-like quests to settle scores with their personal ""Whites"" -- ""those who had committed criminal obscenities on their watch and then walked away untouched by justice"": the sexual predator who bludgeoned to death a 12-year-old; the ringleader of a white street gang who, in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, chased a Pakistani boy into an oncoming car; the man who murdered a college-bound basketball player for making him look bad in a pickup game; a small-time felon who fatally stabbed a ninth grader who had talked to his girlfriend at school.This premise may sound a little strained, but Mr. Brandt immerses us so fully in his characters' lives that the larger contrivances almost completely fall away. No one has a better ear for street language than he (er, Richard Price) does, and no one these days writes with more kinetic energy or more hard-boiled verve. His high-impact prose is the perfect tool for excavating the grisly horrors of urban life: a panic-stricken boy, ""running blindly across the four-lane northbound parkway,"" struck ""by a muscle car doing 65, the sound of the impact"" loud enough ""to set off car alarms for blocks around."" And his ability to map his characters' inner lives -- all the dreams and memories and wounds that make them tick -- results in people who become as vivid to us as real-life relatives or friends.Billy Graves, the hero of ""The Whites,"" is the head of a team of detectives in charge of covering ""all of felony-weight Manhattan from Washington Heights to Wall Street between 1 a.m. and 8 a.m.""; his ""White"" is one Curtis Taft -- the coldblooded killer of a woman, her daughter, and her niece -- whose whereabouts Billy has recently tracked down.Though there is a dark episode in his past involving the accidental and near-fatal shooting of a 10-year-old Hispanic boy in the Bronx many years ago, Billy is a good-hearted, weary-souled fellow with what he thinks of as a ""flatline personality."" It is Mr. Brandt's achievement that he takes Billy's ""bland stolidness"" (which might have been merely boring in the hands of another novelist) and gives us a character as immensely real and sympathetic as Mr. le Carré's George Smiley -- that is, if Smiley were a New York cop.Mr. Brandt conveys the daily grind of Billy's life, one trouble stacking upon the next like piled firewood -- including worries about his tempestuous wife, Carmen; his aging father's dementia; his two beloved sons' safety -- and the exhausting mix of adrenaline and doggedness that his job demands. He captures the odd battlefield rhythms of being a detective: the nights when it was ""nothing but softballs"" and the nights when it's coming in hot and heavy, one horrifying crime after the next, one devastated family after another.To build further tension, Mr. Brandt deals out one more terrible card to poor Billy: a stalker (""big, fast and devoid of mercy"") nearly as sadistic and relentless as Chigurh, the chilling villain in Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, ""No Country for Old Men,"" who has been watching Billy's home and following members of his family.The suspense has little to do with the identity of this stalker -- we're clued in, early on, to who he is -- but with whether he will succeed in exploding Billy's family, and the complicated and long-ago reasons behind his own Ahab-like quest for vengeance. Mr. Brandt does not turn this man into a factory-issue bad guy or a symbol of irredeemable evil, but rather seeks to humanize him, to dramatize the terrible losses that fuel his anger and the internal conflicts he feels, as he's pulled between his need to avenge the terrible wrongs done to his family, and his love for his young daughter, whom he knows he will lose if he completely embraces the dark side.The rest of the characters in ""The Whites"" are delineated with similar emotional gradations. Mr. Brandt chronicles the fraternal bonds among Billy and the surviving members of the Wild Geese that have endured despite ups-and-downs over some two decades, even as most of them have moved on to new lives.Redman Brown, having been shot through the hips in a hostage situation, now runs his father's funeral parlor in Harlem; Jimmy Whelan has become an itinerant building super, living year to year ""in some of the finer basement apartments of the city;"" Yasmeen Assaf-Doyle quit the force to take a security job at a university in Lower Manhattan; and Billy's former partner, big John Pavlicek (nearly large enough ""to have his own ZIP code""), having played ""the exit game"" to perfection, made a bundle buying former crack squats, rehabbing them and flipping them in New York's booming real estate market.""The Whites"" doesn't give the reader the keen sense of changing class and race lines that Mr. Price's 2008 novel, ""Lush Life,"" did, but its sure sense of the rhythms of New York -- the ""general malice"" out there that often kept Billy busy all night and the occasional acts of grace and kindness that help redeem the wearying grind -- lend the Melvillian travails of its characters a local name and habitation. Despite its occasional lumps, this novel is, at once, a gripping police procedural and an affecting study in character and fate.Photograph Photo (C1); Richard Price (Photograph by Lorraine Adams) (C6)",0.0
"An Indictment Is Made, but Residents Stay Wary:   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"Akai Gurley carried no weapon, they said. All he did was step into a darkened stairwell.And the police officer who shot him? Time to bring him to justice, the men and women of the Louis H. Pink Houses in Brooklyn said over and over on Tuesday evening, after learning that Officer Peter Liang, whose bullet killed Mr. Gurley in November, would be indicted on charges including second-degree manslaughter.""He needs to answer to the family, to the community,"" Maritza Ruiz, 45, said. ""There's a young man dead.""Officer Liang, 27, shot Mr. Gurley while patrolling a stairwell at the Pink Houses in East New York less than 18 months into his career with the Police Department.Officer Liang was arraigned on Wednesday afternoon. Shortly before 7 a.m., he stepped out of his home in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Wearing a dark suit and gray tie, he made his way into a waiting S.U.V. and did not respond to questions from a reporter.Like other residents interviewed on Tuesday at the Pink Houses, Ms. Ruiz said she could not stop thinking about how the officer, by drawing his gun, had endangered untold lives in a building where many residents take the stairs because the elevator is unreliable.""It could've been me; it could've been my daughter,"" she said. ""You don't walk into a building with a gun loaded where a lot of innocent people live.""But for several residents, the indictment of Officer Liang -- coming after grand juries in Ferguson, Mo., and on Staten Island declined to indict white officers in other deaths of unarmed black men -- only underscored how capricious justice could be.How could they have faith in the system, they asked, if it seemed to value their lives only intermittently?""How can you be lenient on this one, and hard on the other one?"" said Robert Martin, 46, who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant but was passing the Pink Houses on Tuesday. ""The other cops who shot people should get the same.""For Gregory Rosario, 24, the confusion about what exactly had happened in the stairwell made it all the more ironic that Officer Liang, a Chinese-American, was the only officer who would face charges.""You think if the officer's not a minority, he would get indicted?"" said Mr. Rosario, who grew up in the Pink Houses. ""If he was Caucasian, he wouldn't be indicted. In Eric Garner, they had everything on the table and they didn't do anything. Here there's no video, no proof, but they indicted him.""Police Commissioner William J. Bratton has acknowledged that the shooting was a grave error, and police officials have said it was an accident. But residents said a lack of intent did not make the shooting less frightening.""I just don't understand: Why would he draw his weapon like that?"" Adam Davis, 28, said. ""He should never draw his gun out if he wasn't sure there was a problem.""Mr. Gurley's death has brought spikes of noisy bustle to the Pink Houses -- the bright lights of television news vans, the roar of protesters -- but it has also left the housing project quieter, making children afraid to take the stairs or play outside, Mr. Davis said.Kamala Crew, 43, a seamstress, said she sympathized with Officer Liang.""I'm sorry for who died, but he was a rookie, and he's not accustomed to this lifestyle,"" she said. ""This is so sad. I know cops that did worse than this and got away scot-free.""Ultimately, many of her neighbors said, the indictment could never resolve the broader issues of race and police violence that have defined their debates and aroused their community for many months now.All the indictment represented, they said, was the first step toward closing the case of Mr. Gurley, their friend.""He was a good guy,"" Margarita Robles, 40, said. ""Would I say this is justice? Yes.""Photograph Adam Davis On Tuesday Outside the Brooklyn Housing Project Where a Police Officer Fatally Shot Akai Gurley in November. (Photograph by Chang W.

Red Sox Quickly Go From Lifting Trophy to Raising Doubts:   [Sports Desk ],,"Another member of the brotherhood left the family just before game time on Wednesday. Daniel Nava, an outfielder on the Boston Red Sox' 2013 championship team, was claimed on waivers by Tampa Bay. The Red Sox cut him last week, when he was hitting .152.So it goes for the Red Sox, whose latest title seems more and more like a fluke with each succeeding last-place finish. Only six players from the World Series roster remain active for the Red Sox, with three others on the disabled list and the rest scattered in and out of the game.""I talk to my friends about it; I talk to everyone about it -- I don't ever think that could be duplicated, that team, just the chemistry,"" first baseman Mike Napoli said by his locker at Yankee Stadium before batting practice.""We got to spring training, Day 1, I didn't know anybody in here; a lot of guys didn't. But it was weird, just from the beginning, how we all had the same interests. There were a lot of different personalities, but we were all the same, in a way -- we all cared for each other, picked each other up. It was just so special.""The Red Sox, with a sense of purpose made stronger by the Boston Marathon bombing that April, rolled into October, taking down the Rays, the Detroit Tigers and the St. Louis Cardinals. It was a third championship ring for the owner John Henry, and the one that got away from Mike Ilitch, his counterpart with the Tigers, whose bullpen blew two leads at Fenway to cough up a pennant.On Tuesday, Ilitch fired Dave Dombrowski, the Tigers' president and general manager, icily referring in a statement to ""some success"" that Dombrowski had achieved. Some success, indeed -- the Tigers were a laughingstock before the arrival of Dombrowski, who won two pennants and the last four American League Central titles.That was not enough to save Dombrowski's job, but then, the Red Sox are not satisfied, either. They got the championship that has eluded Detroit, but it buys them no good will from their fans.""In Boston? No,"" Napoli said, laughing. ""That's the beauty of this place, and that's what I love -- you're expected to do good every year. There's an expectation of playing well and making it to the playoffs, which I like. It could be the best place to play, and when you're not doing so well, it's tough.""Tough is an understatement. Before their 2-1 victory Wednesday behind the knuckleballer Steven Wright, the Red Sox (48-60) had held the worst record in the A.L. Only one team in the majors, the Colorado Rockies, had allowed more runs. Only one team, the Philadelphia Phillies, had a worse run differential.Very likely, this will be Boston's third last-place finish in the last four seasons, and the fifth time in six years that the Red Sox miss the playoffs. Larry Lucchino, the president and chief executive, announced on Sunday that he would transition to a reduced role after this season, with Sam Kennedy becoming team president. Now Dombrowski is a free agent.Henry has expressed strong support for General Manager Ben Cherington, and it is hard to imagine Henry adding another highly paid executive position for Dombrowski -- say, president of baseball operations -- above Cherington.But at the very least, the Red Sox must re-evaluate the decision-making process that led to their latest failure. The list of dubious decisions is getting long:Essentially turning Jon Lester into Rick Porcello, whose 5.81 E.R.A. is the worst among qualified starters in the A.L. and whose four-year, $82.5 million contract begins next season.Trading John Lackey (and his $500,000 contract for this season) to St. Louis for outfielder Allen Craig, who is in the minors, and starter Joe Kelly, whose stuff may be best suited for a relief role.Spending $72.5 million for seven years on outfielder Rusney Castillo, who has just 100 at-bats this season and did not start the first two games of this series.Spending $88 million for four years on Hanley Ramirez, who has made a shaky transition to left field and has only 28 extra-base hits this season.Spending $95 million for five years on Pablo Sandoval, who stopped switch-hitting after going 2 for 41 as a right-handed batter -- and has fewer extra-base hits than Ramirez (26), even after doubling twice on Wednesday.""We've got to get information on players that are going to be here beyond 2015,"" Manager John Farrell said, explaining the remaining goals for this season. ""That's veteran and young players alike. We've got to improve our team defense. That's a priority.""We have an obligation as players and as staff to our fans to put forth the effort each and every night with the intent to win,"" he added. ""But internally, our decision making's got to come from how do we improve our team defense, and what information do we get on the young players and the players that will be here beyond 2015?""The easy answer, at least on Castillo, would seem to be to simply play him every day and see how he does. Farrell said Castillo would start on Thursday and Friday, but he said he still must find at-bats for veterans like Napoli (.209 with 13 homers) and outfielder Alejandro De Aza, who was designated for assignment by Baltimore in May but has hit well for Boston.With the rookie Mookie Betts recovering from a concussion, Farrell said Jackie Bradley Jr. would continue to get a long look in center. Bradley is an elite defender but is hitting .102 (5 for 49) this season, his third in a row under .200. ""I think they already know what I can do,"" Bradley said. ""I'm just trying to win; that's my main focus.""Trying has not been the problem for the Red Sox. They have spent money, revamped their roster, and flopped twice since their World Series triumph. All that remains is a two-month petri dish to study.So there will be more tests for rookie starters like Wright, Henry Owens and Eduardo Rodriguez. There will be more answers, perhaps, on Bradley, Castillo and catcher Blake Swihart. And there will surely be more distance from the glorious mirage of 2013.Photograph Boston's Hanley Ramirez in July.

Metropolitan Diary:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"DEAR DIARY:My wife and I were walking down Fifth Avenue toward St. Patrick's in late October after having peeked in on the beautiful architecture of St. Thomas a few blocks north, when the bells from the Episcopal church began sounding the half-hour.A short while after they stopped, the bells of the Catholic cathedral signaled the same half-hour mark.I immediately wondered whether this was just a case of each church's keeping its own reckoning of the proper time, or whether there was an implicit agreement in the spirit of Christian charity for each denomination to let the other sing a solo to passers-by twice each hour.Michael L. MillensonDear Diary:On Valentine's Day in 1957, I moved into a friend's one-bedroom, $34-a-month apartment at 320 East 57th Street. My roommate was a featured dancer in Broadway shows and a pioneer choreographer for television. After a 47-year partnership, he passed away.At that time people had answering services. Ours was called the Belles, operated nearby by two sisters. It catered to people who worked in the theater, many famous. Betty Comden and Adolph Green, the well-known musical comedy writers, were among the customers. Another was Judy Holliday, a major stage and screen star. The trio produced a very successful musical called ""Bells Are Ringing,"" based on the Belles.Some months ago, I stopped by a piano bar in the neighborhood where I occasionally sing. I should not, given my lack of talent and my penchant for forgetting the lyrics of songs. I told my ""Bells Are Ringing"" story and then launched into the final song, ""The Party's Over.""When I finished to a sitting ovation, a gentleman came over and handed me his card. ""I own the Belles,"" he said. Flabbergasted, I said, ""You mean there are people who use such a service after 60 years and answering machines?"" He told about his operators on the East and West Coast. We met again shortly after. To my delight, he looked up my friend's name and found that he was a customer during the 1950s and 1960s.A very nice coincidental encounter. William J. SchneiderDear Diary:When I was a high school senior, I don't remember anyone making a big fuss over college admissions. In fact, what I remember most about senior year was shopping with my mother for my college wardrobe, walking around Greenwich Village with my friends and slow dancing to '50s rock 'n' roll in dark living rooms.And I surely don't remember writing my college essay, because in fact my father wrote it. I don't remember why; I guess I was just too busy trying on clothes at Loehmann's, wandering around the Village and dancing to the Platters.My dad went to N.Y.U. Heights and loved it, and was sure I'd love it too, so he sat down one night and wrote my essay. I think the gist of it was, ""My dad went to N.Y.U. Heights and loved it, and I'm sure I will, too.""Well, apparently it did the trick because I got in. And of course I did love it, and not for a minute did I feel guilty about that ghostwritten essay.In 1973, nine years after I graduated, New York University closed its arts and engineering schools at University Heights and sold the buildings and grounds to CUNY. My old alma mater then became the new, leafy campus of Bronx Community College.I guess some things change.Years later, when my son was too busy studying his Torah portion, my husband sat down one night and wrote the kid's bar mitzvah speech.I guess some things never change. Dana LehrmanDear Diary:The falling leaves,Summer's canceled checks.Jack SauterDear Diary:We decided to meet at Mayahuel; it was odd, because he loathed avocado.Later, we got lost in a public make-out at Penrose followed by a candlelit dinner at Jones Wood Foundry.And then, as it usually goes, I was ""ghosted."" Four months later, the night before the Brooklyn Half-Marathon, he texted, ""Carbo-load?""I thought, sure. I've never been one to turn down pasta. I asked, ""What happened?""And just when you think you've heard it all after countless swipes and train-wreck dates: ""You don't read enough,"" he said. ""So I don't see this going anywhere.""Well, this was new. I'm in P.R. and have built my career off reading and knowing what is being written about. Who did this alleged bibliophile think he was?I left dumbfounded, wondering if I should go pick up ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or a bottle of Tito's.We never spoke again until a random Thursday just past 1 a.m., when an email from him with the following subject line graced my inbox:""Congratulations, you have been gifted a subscription to The New Yorker.""Was this the most passive-aggressive move in the history of casual dating or an unusually cruel, perhaps drunken dig at my illiterate self?A year later I received a job offer in Chicago. Right before I left, I saw him on the other side of the 6 train platform at Grand Central. He didn't see me; his face was buried in that week's issue of The New Yorker.I transferred the subscription to Chicago. I longed for any remnants of New York City in the Midwest.

"A Painter and Places, in Hamptons Close-Ups:   [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDED. Decades before the East End in Long Island became a crowded mecca for summertime vacationers, the Hamptons and their neighboring villages were quiet, rural getaways for artists, from the American Impressionists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries to the Pop artists of the '60s. Visual art still has a lively presence in the area, as viewers can discover at two of the region's pre-eminent destinations.Start with the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center, in East Hampton. Say you want to make a romantic biopic that evokes the New York art world in the era encompassing the rise of its bohemian avant-garde in the 1930s and '40s and the pluralist '70s and '80s. Who would your protagonist be? You can stop scratching your head. No one would be more suitable than the painter, writer and teacher Elaine de Kooning (1918-1989), the subject of ""Elaine de Kooning Portrayed,"" a sweet, small show of self-portraits and portraits of her by others at the center, which occupies the home where the Abstract Expressionists Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner lived in the late 1940s and early '50s.Tall, slender, beautiful and effervescently personable, Ms. de Kooning would be best played by a contemporary equivalent of Katharine Hepburn -- say, Cate Blanchett. In the late '30s, she took lessons from Willem de Kooning before becoming his lover and then wife. She hung out with the mostly male cast of argumentative characters at the Cedar Tavern and held her own in both the talking and drinking departments. She went on to forge a career in the '50s and '60s as a painter of Expressionistic portraits of luminaries like the poet Frank O'Hara, the dancer Merce Cunningham and, to fulfill a commission from the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library, John F. Kennedy. She also wrote prolifically about art and held various university teaching positions.She knew everyone in the New York art world, and she took many as lovers, the critics Harold Rosenberg and Thomas Hess among them. For a couple of decades, she and Mr. de Kooning lived separately but never divorced. Then, in 1976, he asked her to help him get what was by then his chaotic life in order. She bought a house near his in Springs, in East Hampton, and looked after him until her death from lung cancer in 1989, shortly after opening a show of large canvases at the Fischbach Gallery inspired by the cave paintings of Lascaux, France. Mr. de Kooning died eight years later.Timed to coincide with an exhibition of Ms. de Kooning's portraits at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, and organized by the center's director, Helen A. Harrison, the show's 18 works hang in the former living quarters of the small, shingled house, which is still furnished as it was when Pollock and Krasner lived there. It's an intimate setting for what amounts to a single collective portrait.Ms. de Kooning's self-portraits, all of herself in her studio in 1946, are outstanding. They include two carefully observed ink drawings and two small paintings in muted colors that blend realism, Cubism and Surrealism with a deft touch.Mr. de Kooning's exquisitely penciled ""Portrait of Elaine"" (1940-41), one of his most widely reproduced drawings, is here along with a similarly magical, neo-Classical drawing by Hedda Sterne from 1953. There are also sketchy drawings by Arshile Gorky, Robert De Niro Sr. and Aristodimos Kaldis.A nearly life-size painting of the artist made by Fairfield Porter in 1957 shows her sitting in a red dress and brown overcoat on a floral-patterned sofa, a picture of relaxed elegance. An unusually poignant 1965 painting by Alex Katz focuses on her eyes. She seems tired and pensive, maybe because she had recently quit drinking after many years of overindulging.Edvard Lieber, a close friend who became the executor of her estate, created a mixed-media abstraction on paper called ""Point: Elaine de Kooning in Central Park"" in 1979. Looking closely, you can see the ghosts left after he removed snapshots of Ms. de Kooning that once adhered to the page. A small valentine heart drawn in pencil on a folded sheet of computer paper by the collagist Ray Johnson is dated 2-1-89, the day she died. It's a sad, loving tribute.The other primary East End destination for the art-historically curious is the Parrish Art Museum, founded in 1897 by Samuel Longstreth Parrish (1849-1932) in Southampton to display his collection of Italian Renaissance art and copies of Greek and Roman sculpture. In 2012 the museum moved into a big, chic shed of a building in nearby Water Mill that was designed by the architectural firm Herzog & de Meuron.Exhibitions at the Parrish often have focused on artists who have lived in or regularly visited the East End. Departing from that tradition, this summer's show, ""Andreas Gursky: Landscapes,"" presents photographs by the internationally celebrated German artist. (By a curious coincidence, Mr. Gursky lives and works in a former industrial building in Düsseldorf, Germany, that was rehabilitated by Herzog & de Meuron.)When Mr. Gursky's immense photographs first began appearing in New York galleries in the 1990s they were terrifically exciting for their sheer size and for their implicit commentaries on capitalist globalization. But then came a flood of oversize photographs by others like Thomas Struth, Thomas Ruff, Candida Höfer and Gregory Crewdson and by legions of those artists' imitators. Now such large, overproduced pictures, including Mr. Gursky's here, have about them the stale air of white elephants.Viewers unfamiliar with his work, however, are bound to be impressed. Organized by the museum's director, Terrie Sultan, the exhibition presents 19 works from the early 1980s to 2014. The biggest, ""Engadin I"" (1995), is a nearly 12-foot-wide picture of a white-capped mountain in Switzerland with the tiny figures of hundreds of cross-country skiers skimming a field of snow in the foreground.The most powerful works pick out socially and politically fraught subjects. ""Greeley"" (2002) is a hellish, bird's-eye view of cattle in muddy stockyards in Colorado. Mr. Gursky's images usually have a clever formal aspect, too, as in an aerial view of a Grand Prix racetrack in Bahrain from 2005, wherein the black, serpentine bands of the pavement stand out like gestural lines in an abstract painting.The spectacular, 8-foot-by-11-foot ""Katar (Qatar)"" (2012) depicts a vast gleaming interior paneled in gold-hued metal whose size dwarfs a lone worker under a semitransparent plastic tent in a far corner. It looks like a science-fiction movie set but is in fact a gas tank on a transport ship in the Persian Gulf.More puzzling are the show's most recent works, each of which feature a cinematic superhero. In ""SH I"" (2013), Iron Man in full costume and a young woman canoodle under palm trees by a peaceful sea. In ""SH II (Diptych)"" (2014), a two-part piece measuring more than 10 feet by 12 feet over all, Superman sits thinking in an otherworldly landscape under a full moon. These are ridiculous and not in a good way.It gives pause that the show's hardcover catalog was co-published by the Parrish and Gagosian Gallery, which represents Mr. Gursky. According to Ms. Sultan's acknowledgments in the catalog, Gagosian also was among those who ""generously supported this effort."" This is unsettling if you value the intellectual independence of public museums. Clearly, for Gagosian, it's a good opportunity to attract clients from among the wealthier denizens of the East End.Also at the Parrish are two sculptural works by Tara Donovan as part of the museum's ""Platform"" series, which invites artists to respond to the museum setting. Ms. Donovan is known for assembling myriad ordinary objects like plastic straws and drinking cups into optically captivating installations. Here she uses the spiral spring toy known as the Slinky. On two adjacent walls in the museum's atrium she has flattened scores of them into a mural-scale composition that looks like meandering tracks left by a giant, primordial snail. In one of the museum's smaller galleries, Ms. Donovan has installed a fully three-dimensional piece suggesting an explosion in a Slinky factory.Opening this weekend at Guild Hall is a summery show of works by Roy Lichtenstein. ""Between Sea and Sky"" will present more than 30 pieces from the 1960s to the 1990s in which that eminently inventive Pop artist played with seascape conventions in a variety of materials and styles. And guess what? The exhibition's principal sponsor is Larry Gagosian, who represents Lichtenstein's work. (An exhibition of the artist's 1983 work ""Greene Street Mural"" opens at Mr. Gagosian's West 24th Street gallery in Chelsea on Sept. 10.)Intimate Views and Wide PerspectivesThree art shows beckon visitors to the East End of Long Island.""ELAINE DE KOONING PORTRAYED"" continues through Oct. 31 at the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center, 830 Springs-Fireplace Road, East Hampton; 631-324-4929, pkhouse.org.""ANDREAS GURSKY: LANDSCAPES"" runs through Oct. 18 at the Parrish Art Museum, 279 Montauk Highway, Water Mill; 631-283-2118, parrishart.org.""ROY LICHTENSTEIN: BETWEEN SEA AND SKY"" with lesser-known land and seascapes from the 1960s to the '90s, opens on Saturday and runs through Oct. 8 at Guild Hall, 158 Main Street, East Hampton; 631-324-0806, guildhall.org.",0.0
Directors Guild Gives Prize to Iñárritu:   [Brief ],,"The Directors Guild of America on Saturday gave its top prize to Alejandro G.

Coming of Age at Full Blast:   [Review ],,"Minnie Goetze, the 15-year-old heroine of ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl,"" is a would-be cartoonist who, despite her first name, is closer in lusty spirit and scratchy pen to Robert Crumb than to Walt Disney. When, partway through this gutsy, exhilarating movie, she draws her first cartoon, it's of a bodacious female colossus striding across San Francisco. As this inky giant keeps on trucking, she evokes the 50-foot-woman of cult film fame, if one that has received a Crumb makeover, with thighs as mighty as giant sequoias and a bottom that rolls like a ship in a storm.The terrific actress Bel Powley was in her early 20s when ""Diary"" was shot, but looks more like a teenager than most of the generically buffed and prettified adolescents who populate American screens. She has the wide-open look children have before life gets in the way. But she's on the short side and is dwarfed by Kristen Wiig (great), who plays Charlotte, Minnie's boozy, inattentive mother. Ms. Powley looks almost doll-like, Lilliputian, when staring up at Alexander Skarsgard (a perfect worm), who plays Monroe, a mustachioed loafer with pitiful self-improvement plans. He's Charlotte's boyfriend when the movie opens, and he's also sleeping with the very willing, all-too-eager Minnie, although calling him her lover doesn't seem quite right -- but neither does predator.What you call Monroe, other than an expletive, depends on what you call a man having sex with a 15-year-old girl. ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" takes place in 1976, when the age of consent in California was 18 (it still is), but it unfolds in an anything-goes milieu in which Monroe might be branded more of an opportunist than a creep. Drinks and pot smoke flow through its rooms, in between snorts of cocaine. Charlotte works as a librarian and parties like, well, someone with no children, having apparently traded in Dr. Spock for Dr. Feelgood. In her hedonism, if mostly in her egotism (it's all about her), Charlotte comes off like a case study for ""The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations,"" Christopher Lasch's 1979 era-defining classic.The writer-director Marielle Heller doesn't judge the partying; she leaves that to her viewers, assuming that they come to this movie with their own ideas on the subject. She knows you can fill in all kinds of blanks, including the explicit details of Minnie and Monroe's encounters. Her discretion is a commercially expedient choice, of course; Ms. Heller wants to turn you on rather than off. But she also wants to be true to Minnie. Given this, it's important that the one time you see Minnie fully naked is when she's alone with her body and thoughts in her bedroom, gazing into a mirror. She may be the object of Monroe's lust (and he is unambiguously hers), but Ms. Heller ensures that Minnie -- who's never lighted or framed for the viewer's erotic contemplation -- isn't ours.Using a sharp scalpel, Ms. Heller extracted the story from Phoebe Gloeckner's trippy, autobiographically informed novel of the same title. Both versions of the story follow Minnie as she rides out adolescence, which goes very dark in Ms. Gloeckner's novel. Ms. Heller plays down or elides its more harrowing episodes (rape, hard drugs) and sweetens the overarching narrative by emphasizing its comic absurdity. She also embellishes the movie with cartoon hearts and flowers that wouldn't be out of place in Disney's ""Snow White."" Truer to the novel's spirit, she brings in (via the animator Sara Gunnarsdottir) an illustrated version of Aline Kominsky-Crumb, a.k.a. Mrs. Crumb, a feminist cartoonist who pops into the picture and functions as part imaginary friend, part groovy fairy godmother.Aline shows up just when Minnie needs her, materializing on a street and parked in a diner booth. Charlotte is at once present and not, and few other adults are of any help to Minnie, including her mother's former squeeze, Pascal (Christopher Meloni). Not that Minnie, who keeps her own counsel, no matter how unwise, would pay attention. As the title announces, the movie isn't about the arguments of lawyers, judges or any other guardians of the moral galaxy, any more than it's about questionable child rearing, predatory men and regrettable girlfriends. It is the diary of a specific, complex, sometimes muddled teenager who owns her story, her life and her pleasure, from the moment she says, ""I had sex today,"" to her rueful, hopeful closing declaration of self.That wee self is by turns a joy and a heartbreaker, and often an affectingly honest hormone bomb waiting to explode. Minnie looks together when you first meet her, sailing through a city park with a Cheshire cat smile, her saucer eyes bugging as she takes in the local color (facial hair and liberated, jauntily bouncing breasts) that starts to set the freewheeling, at times freaky, San Francisco scene. Once back in her bedroom -- where a large poster of a bare-chested Iggy Pop watches over her, next to a photo of Janis Joplin -- Minnie begins making audiotapes, using a recorder as a diary into which she can pour her desires, dreams, fears and thrillingly dirty secrets.It would be easy to call Minnie a victim, and Monroe the villain, even if that's not at all how it plays out in the movie. Monroe may not be exactly the light of Minnie's life, but for much of the story, he is the fire of her loins, to borrow and bend some opening words from Nabokov's ""Lolita."" In the preface to a later edition of her novel, Ms. Gloeckner writes that, in many ways, it is about her, but that it's also about the reader. ""Although I am the source of Minnie, she cannot be me -- for the book to have real meaning, she must be all girls, anyone."" It's a familiar universal appeal and also insistently political. The novel is life-specific, but what makes Minnie -- on the page and now on the screen -- greater than any one girl is how she tells her own story in her own soaringly alive voice.""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) The movie has sex scenes between a minor and an adult, as well as drug and alcohol use, seen through a girl's eyes.The Diary of a Teenage GirlOpens on FridayWritten and directed by Marielle Heller, based on the book by Phoebe Gloeckner; director of photography, Brandon Trost; edited by Marie-Hélène Dozo and Koen Timmerman; music by Nate Heller; production design by Jonah Markowitz; produced by Anne Carey, Bert Hamelinck, Madeline Samit and Miranda Bailey; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

Independent Monitor to Evaluate Chicago Police Stops:   [National Desk ],,"CHICAGO -- Under an agreement with the American Civil Liberties Union, the Chicago Police Department will allow independent evaluations of its stop-and-frisk procedures that critics say target blacks.The agreement, which was announced Friday, calls for increased public disclosure and more officer training. It follows a scathing report in March from the A.C.L.U. of Illinois that found Chicago officers disproportionately targeted blacks and other racial minorities in hundreds of thousands of stop, question and frisk encounters.Under the agreement, a former federal magistrate judge, Arlander Keys, will provide public reports twice a year on Chicago police investigatory stops and pat downs, looking at whether the city is meeting its legal requirements. The agreement goes into effect immediately.""It's not going to be a change in the actual way that we stop people, it's going to be a change in the way that we record the stop,"" the police superintendent, Garry McCarthy, said at a Friday news conference. And he suggested that the evaluations would bear out his belief that the stops had been constitutional.Mr. McCarthy also said that he was pleased his department was not compelled to take action by a court order and that he hoped the agreement would set the standard for other police departments.The president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association said other departments would be wise to follow Chicago's lead.""If we can address the community concerns without having to go to court, without a lawsuit, I think that's obviously a better way and certainly better for the relationship between the police and the community,"" said Tom Manger, chief of police in Montgomery County, Md., who was in Chicago to meet with Mr. McCarthy and other police chiefs.The only concern Mr. McCarthy said he had was that the extra paperwork might take officers off the streets for too long.In its report, the A.C.L.U. of Illinois identified more than 250,000 Chicago stop-and-frisk encounters in which there were no arrests from May through August 2014. African-Americans accounted for nearly three-quarters of those stopped, even though they make up about a third of the city's population.The agreement comes after months of negotiations between the city, the department and the A.C.L.U. that aimed to avoid expensive and time-consuming litigation, the parties said.The police department still faces a federal class-action lawsuit with 53 African-American plaintiffs claiming the street stops had led to constitutional abuses, including unlawful searches and seizures as well as excessive force.""I certainly think that it does add a lot of credibility to the lawsuit,"" said Antonio Romanucci, a lawyer handling the lawsuit.The city and department have agreed to collect additional data about investigatory stops. That will include officers' names and badge numbers, the race, ethnicity and gender of the people stopped, the reason for the stops, whether the people were frisked and other details.That information will be given to the A.C.L.U. and Mr. Keys, who will oversee the agreement's implementation.Mr. McCarthy has been a proponent of stop-and-frisk and worked at two police departments that came under fire for their use of the tactic -- the New York City Police Department and the Newark Police Department in New Jersey, which he headed before coming to Chicago.In New York, a monitor is overseeing changes to the stop-and-frisk policy after a federal judge ruled that the tactic sometimes discriminated against minorities. Last August, the city dropped appeals after Mayor Bill de Blasio -- who was elected, in part, on a campaign opposing stop-and-frisk -- took office.And the Newark department was placed under a federal monitor after the Justice Department found that when Mr. McCarthy ran it, 75 percent of pedestrian stops were made without constitutionally adequate reasons.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",0.0
Ebola Challenges a Hands-On Tool:   [Science Desk ],,"Doctors treating Ebola patients while wearing ""the full spacesuit"" -- protective gear, including waterproof hoods -- are struggling with a clinician's dilemma: what to do if they can't use one of the oldest, most basic tools in medicine -- a stethoscope.It's not safe to cut holes in the hood, and nothing that might be contaminated should touch bare skin or the delicate ear canals.Also, nothing that touches an infected patient should touch another or leave the ward. As a result, said Dr. Robert A. Fowler, a Canadian critical care specialist who helped write the World Health Organization treatment guidelines, ""it's quite uncommon that you see a stethoscope on an Ebola ward in Africa.""Although cases are dropping rapidly in Africa, experts said stethoscopes could become more important as the remaining patients receive lifesaving intravenous hydration. A stethoscope can detect the sound of fluid in the lungs -- the same ""wet, crackling"" sound caused by pneumonia -- that indicates a patient has been on the IV drip too long.In American hospitals treating Ebola patients, doctors have used expensive electronic stethoscopes.A $500 version from Thinklabs, a Colorado-based company, was used on Ebola patients at New York's Bellevue Hospital Center and at University of Nebraska Medical Center. The hollow tubes are replaced by disposable earbuds that fit under the waterproof hood. The wire runs out the sleeve and plugs into a rechargeable, diaphragm-equipped microphone that acts as the bell. That microphone stays in the patient's room, and the earbuds are thrown out. The microphone can also be plugged into speakers or into a cellphone for transmission.""It's a cool gadget,"" said Dr. Laura Evans, the lead doctor in the care of Dr. Craig Spencer at Bellevue in the fall. ""It looks like a hockey puck, but you get a nice, loud sound quality -- much better than the disposable stethoscopes we tried.""Before cases in Africa began dropping, Dr. Armand Sprecher, an Ebola expert for Doctors Without Borders, said his agency was considering field-testing a $400 3M electronic stethoscope and would be willing to consider the Thinklabs model.Kyle Hall, the telehealth coordinator for Nebraska Medicine, which oversees the hospital that successfully treated two Ebola patients, said doctors there had tried both and preferred the Thinklabs model because it used no hollow tubes and directed the sound via wire, rather than Bluetooth, which can be blocked.Several doctors working in Africa described stethoscopes as helpful but not indispensable there. Heart and lung ailments are not among the typical initial Ebola symptoms, which usually include fever, aches, vomiting and diarrhea. However, later symptoms can include heart failure from potassium loss and bleeding into the lungs.Also, in the absence of electronic monitors, a stethoscope can help determine whether a patient is comatose or actually dead.Doctors Without Borders once used light surgical head covers. ""With those,"" Dr. Sprecher said, ""you could sort of cram the earpieces in your ears and use them -- in an unsatisfactory way.""Now that thick hoods that fluids cannot penetrate are mandatory, the agency uses other ""workarounds"" that ""hard-core clinicians who fetishize the bedside exam"" would reject, Dr. Sprecher said, but were useful under crisis conditions.For example, they used only half of a blood-pressure reading, the systolic pressure -- the 120 in a 120/80 reading, for example. That can be taken by inflating a blood pressure cuff on an arm and feeling with a finger at what pressure the pulse below it restarts. (Getting the diastolic pressure requires a stethoscope to hear the thumping of the blood disappear as the cuff's pressure ends completely.)The top number ""isn't a complete picture, but it's pretty good,"" he said. ""If it starts dropping, you start to worry.""The agency is testing battery-powered cuffs that obtain both numbers, but it is still unclear if they can survive chlorine spray.Another workaround involves the body's reaction to the loss of fluids and electrolytes. Patients' hearts may speed up and become irregular, and patients may hyperventilate, unconsciously trying to blow off carbon dioxide as their bodies become more acidic. A stethoscope makes diagnosis easier, but it can be done by taking pulses and counting breaths.""If they are huffing and puffing, they're very sick,"" Dr. Sprecher said.A stethoscope is also useful for hearing bowel sounds, he added, ""but when diarrhea is pouring out, you don't need a stethoscope to know the patient's bowel is working overtime.""Dr. Pranav Shetty, emergency health coordinator for the International Medical Corps, said his doctors avoided stethoscopes for safety and used similar workarounds, along with measures like urine output. But with more patients on IV drips, stethoscopes could help detect those being hydrated too much.Also, Dr. Fowler of the W.H.O. noted, many Africans have had untreated infections, such as ear infections, that scar the heart valves. Leaky valves also cause fluid backup in the lungs, and stethoscopes can distinguish between the two causes.Portable X-ray machines and ultrasound scanners could also do it, he said, but they are rare in Ebola wards and difficult to sterilize.Clive Smith, the inventor of the Thinklabs stethoscope, said that his device could be used even in crowded Ebola wards. Although chlorine spray would destroy its circuitry, he said, the bell could be wiped with alcohol or bleach pads.Alternatively, he said, some American hospitals now put an ""ultrasound condom"" on the diaphragm between patients, and in a pinch, a clean surgical glove or a sandwich bag could serve the same purpose.Photograph (Photograph by Eric Francis for the New York Times)",0.0
Dry Days Bring Ferocious Start to Fire Season:   [News; Series ],,"WALLA WALLA, Wash. -- Another summer of record-breaking drought and heat has seized the West, setting off costly and destructive wildfires from Southern California, where a single blaze burned more than 30,000 acres of national forest east of Los Angeles, to Montana, where a fast-moving fire in Glacier National Park recently forced tourists to flee hotels, campgrounds and vehicles.No measurable rain has fallen here in Walla Walla since May. Temperatures have broken decades-old records. And, though known for soaking skies and cool summers, Washington State is well on track to surpass last year's wildfire season, its busiest on record.Dozens of homes and thousands of acres have burned over the past few months -- in the rain forests of the Olympic Peninsula, in suburban communities on the edge of the wild lands, and in this city of wheat farms and vineyards where hundreds of firefighters are still battling a blaze on the western slopes of the Blue Mountains, digging and scraping the earth, building barriers of dirt to shield the dried-out forests from the approaching flames.""Our fire season started a month ahead, our crops matured weeks ahead and the dry weather we usually get in August, we've had since May,"" said Peter J. Goldmark, Washington's commissioner of public lands. Walking along the edge of the Blue Creek fire, burning near the Oregon-Washington border, he added, ""By heavens, if this isn't a sign of climate change, then what is climate change going to bring?""The entire region is under duress. It has been so dry for so long that federal officials have warned about the potential for more catastrophe in the months ahead, as drought and climate change push high temperatures higher, drying already-arid lands.The conditions vary from one area to the next: an unforgiving drought in California, where a fire captain died Thursday night while battling one of 23 wildfires burning in the northern part of the state; snow that arrived late and melted early in Idaho; extreme temperature swings in the Southwest; and grass that has turned to tinder across the Pacific Northwest.But the West's stubborn drought seems to be especially devastating the farther north it reaches. In Alaska, 399 fires burned in June. That was nearly double the number seen in the same month in 2004 -- considered to have been the state's worst fire year on record.In the past, the fires mostly burned tundra. This year, though, several have merged and marched toward cities and small fishing villages, destroying, damaging or threatening hundreds of homes.It is all part of an extensive nationwide scorching. About 63,312 wildfires destroyed 3.6 million acres of land across the country last year, at a cost of $1.52 billion to fight the fires.Early projections have placed this year's cost even higher, at up to $2.1 billion, well beyond the $1.5 billion set aside by the federal Interior and Agriculture Departments, which administer more than 600 million acres of public lands.The Obama administration has asked Congress to place wildfires in the same category as hurricanes and floods, with a dedicated disaster fund to pay for their suppression. Federal agencies have been forced for years to pay for firefighting with money that had been set aside for preventive programs to minimize the long-term risk of those wildfires, compounding the problem of frequent fires.The Republican leadership in Congress has yet to endorse any of the proposals.""These are emergencies,"" Interior Secretary Sally Jewell told reporters recently, as she urged Congress to act. ""They should be treated as such.""Rain and HeatIn Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona earlier this summer, Doug Sprouse and three other firefighters picked up clumps of grass from the ground, sawed off pieces from fallen branches and pulled bright leaves from oak trees -- ""fuels,"" in their vernacular, the stuff that feeds and carries fire across the land.A drizzle was all it had taken to enliven the high desert's foliage and tinge the woods in rich shades of green. But with months of negligible snowfall behind and the temperatures climbing, Mr. Sprouse, an engine captain with the National Park Service, knew it would not take long until the foliage became tinder.The finer the fuel, the faster it loses the water it holds inside -- and when it is dry, it is like kindling in a campfire.He looked around, seizing on subtle signs of want on the big trees, like the yellowed tips on the needles of thirsty Ponderosa pines. ""When it comes to moisture,"" he said, ""these woods have been running on red for a really long time.""Between 2005 and 2014, the average number of fires that burned more than 100,000 acres -- known as ""megafires"" -- increased to 9.8 per year, up from fewer than one a year before 1995, according to statistics compiled by the National Interagency Fire Center, a multiagency logistical hub in Boise, Idaho.One reason, ecologists and historians say, is the well-established link between big fires and the steady loss of moisture in forests from higher temperatures brought on by climate change.Even when it rains, as it did in Arizona this spring, there is no guarantee it will be enough. Rain needs to be sustained over long periods to end the drought affecting the West, experts say, and rising temperatures continue to increase the risk from flames.According to findings by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 10 of the warmest years on record have occurred since 1998. Already, 2015 is challenging 2014 for the No. 1 spot on that list.""It's like a bank account you can't balance,"" said A. Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in Palisades, N.Y., who has studied the effects of climate change in living organisms. ""You deposit moisture, but so much of it is withdrawn through heat and evaporation there just isn't enough to meet the demand.""Scientists have spoken of ""climatological extremes"" as the new normal, a trend underlined by this year's El Niño pattern, which brought extraordinary rainfall to the Southwest, causing deadly floods in Texas while wiping out short-term drought conditions in eastern New Mexico.Alaska had a lot of rain, too, just at the wrong time: It fell in March, melting its anemic snowpack two months earlier than usual. Mushy snow on the trails forced organizers to move the starting line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race 220 miles north to Fairbanks, where the temperature reached 86 on May 23: 3 degrees warmer than in Phoenix.Canada, with an unprecedented 5,548 fires and 9.1 million acres burned as of July 23, registered record temperatures in May and June, Earth's warmest such month on record, according to NASA and several other climate reporting organizations.In Oregon, another state normally known for cool and wet conditions, Gov. Katherine Brown recently declared drought emergencies in three counties. There are now 23 Oregon counties with such emergencies, more than double last year's tally.""The extreme drought conditions we are experiencing reflect a new reality for Oregon,"" she said in a statement.The Arid NorthwestAll across the Northwest, patches of earth are thirsty. The vegetation is extremely dry, often yellow and brittle, a condition fueled by the same warmer, drier patterns that are contributing to worsening drought and longer fire seasons around the world.But the West is also facing the consequences of a decades-old policy of extinguishing every fire as fast as possible, often the morning after it sparks, essentially undercutting fire's natural role as janitor of the wild lands.The accelerating pace of development in the wild has added another dimension to the challenge. A recent report by Verisk Analytics, a risk assessment firm, showed that 4.5 million homes in 13 Western states were at high or extreme risk of being damaged or destroyed by wildfire.In Wenatchee, Wash., a recent firestorm turned a neighborhood to ash, ravaging 24 homes as it barreled through.In Walla Walla, residents worried about the Blue Creek fire's march toward their homes and crops.""I've lost 1,000 acres to the fire,"" said Mark Klicker, whose family harvests timber in the area. ""It really is gut-wrenching, kinda like you ate the wrong food. You feel helpless.""Jonathan B. Jarvis, director of the National Park Service, said the agency had been working to adapt to this new reality of wild variations in climate and larger, more intense blazes, which have already begun to alter the composition of some landscapes.One of the most extreme examples is the Bandelier National Monument, near Los Alamos, N.M., where two fires, in 2000 and 2011, sterilized the ground, leaving huge patches of forest entirely denuded, including one measuring about 30,000 acres.He acknowledged the proven benefits of fire: Ashes fertilize soil, and burned logs create habitats for wildlife. But he also warned about the devastation from fires that are just too intense.""We're concerned about our children's ability to experience these places like we have,"" Mr. Jarvis said.One way to help, he said, is to make fire an ally. In national parks and forests across the nation, firefighters are using ""prescribed"" burns -- in which some lightning-sparked blazes are allowed to burn within specific areas -- to clear dried grass and brush.On the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, fire managers use the fuel samples gathered by Mr. Sprouse and his crew every week from March through November to decide when -- or if -- it is safe to use flames from controlled burns this way, as a giant broom.On a cool day in June, when a thick layer of clouds blanketed the skies, they placed the samples in plastic containers roughly the size of baby food jars and labeled them according to how long it takes for each to soak up and lose moisture.In the office, where the fuels were measured for water content, Dan Pearson, fire management officer for the park's South District, explained that the trees are stressed because of the progressive loss of moisture they have endured for 10 years.Mr. Pearson, who runs the fire and aviation programs on his side of the park, explained that his job ""isn't to figure out why the environment is changing."" Rather, it is to make the best possible decision in a changing environment.But here in Washington during the Blue Creek fire, which has burned more than 6,000 acres since it started on July 20, Mr. Goldmark turned his attention to another, more immediate and complicating factor: meteorologists' predictions of the El Niño pattern lasting into the spring.Typically, it means cooler temperatures for the desert Southwest and warmer, drier weather for much of the Pacific Northwest and Northern Plains -- a dangerous prospect.""All of these trees, even though they look green, they're all pretty dry,"" Mr. Goldmark said, pointing at the firs and spruces that lined the burning mountainsides. ""If this full-blown El Niño pans out, we should all be worried about what the next fire season is going to be like.""Photograph The Rocky Fire in Lake County, Calif., Broke Out Wednesday and Spread to 8,000 Acres.

Jays Acquire Optimism in Flurry of Transactions:   [Sports Desk ],,"TORONTO -- Paul Molitor rounded the bases just ahead of Joe Carter on that electrifying night of Oct. 23, 1993. He felt the roar that pulsated inside the Skydome when he scored the winning run on Carter's homer, giving the Toronto Blue Jays their second consecutive World Series title.It remains the last postseason play in Blue Jays history.Nearly 22 years later, Molitor was back in Toronto this week as the manager of the Minnesota Twins. On Monday he was reminded of that exciting time long ago, as more than 45,000 people filtered into the seats of the same stadium and threw their vocal support behind David Price, one of several new Blue Jays players who those fans hope will finally get Canada's team back into the postseason.""I've seen and heard it before here when it's like that,"" Molitor said the next day as his team stretched before batting practice. ""This sounded to me like there was more hunger to it. There was some real urgency there.""When the Kansas City Royals reached the World Series last year, they wiped clean their account as the team with the longest absence from the playoffs, not having been there since they won it all in 1985.Now the onus is on the Blue Jays, who are acting as if they want to hand that baton of futility to someone else. General Manager Alex Anthopoulos made a dizzying series of trades right before the July 31 nonwaiver deadline to enhance the roster, hauling in a trove of talent that was the envy of 29 other teams.Anthopoulos and the Blue Jays have made bold moves before, but there is a universal sense that this time is different. He acquired Troy Tulowitzki -- to some the best shortstop in baseball -- from the Rockies. He pried Price -- considered the best pitcher available -- from the Tigers. Anthopoulos also grabbed outfielder Ben Revere from the Phillies and the relief pitchers Mark Lowe, dealt by the Mariners, and LaTroy Hawkins, who came with Tulowitzki from Colorado.Almost overnight, a team that needed significant upgrades, particularly an ace pitcher, had virtually everything required to quench its postseason thirst.""Alex's moves have given the team a jolt, and it gave the fans a jolt,"" Manager John Gibbons said. ""Now's the tough part. Now, you've got to go out and win.""So far, the Jays have. At the time of the Tulowitzki deal, which had been brewing since last off-season, the Blue Jays were underachievers. Their record was 50-50, seven games behind the Yankees in the American League East despite having the best run differential (118 after Thursday's win).But after Tulowitzki put on the uniform July 29, homering in his Jays debut, Toronto won eight of its next nine games to move into the second A.L. wild-card spot. The Blue Jays are also four and a half games behind the Yankees, the team Toronto will visit this weekend in the Bronx.As well as the Yankees are playing this season, confidence is surging in Toronto and across Canada, especially because this weekend's games are the first of 13 left between the teams, providing ample opportunities for the Blue Jays to whittle away the deficit.""I'd like to say,"" outfielder Jose Bautista said, ""that the inclination for me to feel optimistic about our chances, with our additions and some of the stuff that's going on over there with injuries and lack of performances, that if I was a betting man, I would bet on us.""Bautista, who hit a thundering grand slam against the Twins on Wednesday, is still at the core of a lineup that is stacked with right-handed power. Even before the trades, Toronto had scored more runs than any other team, and its on-base plus slugging percentage was the highest in the majors.But now Tulowitzki is leading off. Third baseman Josh Donaldson, who was brought over from the Oakland Athletics in an off-season trade, bats second and is the Jays' hottest hitter, with five home runs in his last seven games. He had 29 home runs and 29 doubles after Thursday's series finale with the Twins, which the Blue Jays won, 9-3.Edwin Encarnacion is also a threat in the middle of the lineup, and catcher Russell Martin, another big off-season acquisition, mostly bats sixth. Bautista said that when he looks around the clubhouse now, he is struck by how many good players he sees. Even those who have played in a World Series, like Tulowitzki in 2007, agree.""I've played with good players before,"" Tulowitzki said, ""but not this many.""Pitching was the real need. Toronto's starting pitchers' earned run average is 3.93, tied for 16th-best in baseball. Adding Price allows everyone else to slot into more fitting roles in the rotation.""When Price is on the mound, that's the best team in baseball,"" said Twins pitcher Mike Pelfrey, who did not figure in the four-game series here.Price, who tossed eight superb innings in his debut Monday, is scheduled to pitch Saturday at Yankee Stadium, where he has a career 6-2 record and a 3.52 E.R.A. Tulowitzki will also make his first appearance there since last year when he showed up as a fan after visiting a doctor in New York. The visit fueled speculation that he wanted to be traded to the Yankees to replace Derek Jeter.""I just went to watch my favorite player, my idol growing up,"" Tulowitzki said of Jeter. ""People thought I was going there for different reasons, and that wasn't the case. It was an opportunity to watch Derek play one last time and see how he goes about his business. It was just a way to make myself a better player, really.""Instead of taking over for Jeter, Tulowitzki ended up replacing Jose Reyes, a former Mets shortstop, who was sent to the Rockies in the deal.Many of Anthopoulos's previous moves did not produce their desired results. In November 2012, he engineered a blockbuster trade that brought Reyes, Josh Johnson and Mark Buehrle from the Marlins. A month later, he got R. A. Dickey from the Mets in a deal for Noah Syndergaard and Travis d'Arnaud.The Blue Jays missed the playoffs.Now Anthopoulos is in the final year of his contract, and Paul Beeston, the team president, is stepping down at the end of the season. Last off-season, the Jays went after Dan Duquette, the general manager of the Baltimore Orioles, and they are also said to covet Dave Dombrowski, who was recently let go by the Tigers.That kind of speculation could lead a general manager to make precipitous moves to save his job. But Anthopoulos, who gave up many prospects in last month's deals, has not abandoned the future: He did not trade pitcher Marcus Stroman, a top prospect, in the off-season, and he recently spent $4 million to sign the 16-year-old Vladimir Guerrero Jr., using money that could have gone toward the current team.Asked about mortgaging the team's future, Anthopoulos said: ""I never operate that way. I just don't believe in it. I had so many opportunities to move players that could impact us long-term, and I didn't. We didn't like those deals. These deals we liked.""A year ago at the deadline, Anthopoulos was criticized for not making trades to help the flagging team, but executives on other teams said the Jays did not have the payroll flexibility to do so. This year, Anthopoulos set aside money in the off-season for July 31, enabling him to add Price, Tulowitzki and a ton of optimism.""Last year at this time, we as players felt we were on the descent,"" Dickey said. ""You could feel it. It was palpable. This year it's the antithesis of that. We feel like we're on the ascent.""Photograph Above, David Price Walked Off to a Standing Ovation After His Blue Jays Debut On Monday.

"Cuomo, Seeking to Save 2 Nuclear Plants, Will Order Increase in Clean Energy:   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"Frustrated by the pending shutdown of two nuclear power plants on Lake Ontario, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo plans to order state regulators to mandate that, by 2030, half of all power consumed by New Yorkers be generated from renewable sources that emit much less carbon dioxide, people briefed on the matter said.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has already declared a goal of having 50 percent of the state's power come from solar, wind, hydroelectric or other renewable sources in 15 years, but the state has had no means of enforcing that directive. The governor intends to have the Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities in the state, codify the requirement, these people said. Some of them, including a Cuomo administration official, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to discuss the proposed mandate.The mandate would be another step toward the governor's goal of a 40 percent reduction in carbon emissions from plants supplying the state's electricity. In the intervening years, the energy policy would give utilities an incentive to use power generated by nuclear plants, which are considered clean sources, though not renewable.By pushing utilities to obtain more of the power they distribute from less-polluting sources, state officials hope to delay the planned shutdown of two nuclear power plants on the shore of Lake Ontario. Aides to the governor have been trying for several weeks to dissuade Entergy from closing one of them, the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant in Oswego County.Entergy officials say they will close the plant in late 2016 or early 2017 because it has been losing about $60 million a year. Nuclear plants emit less air pollution than power plants fueled by natural gas or coal, so the loss of them would set back the state's hopes of meeting its clean-energy goals.Even if the mandate comes too late to keep the reactor at the FitzPatrick plant operating, state officials hope it could prolong the life of the Robert E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant near Rochester. The Ginna plant's owners said in 2014 that they intended to shut it down, but state officials struck a deal to subsidize its operation to keep it running until 2017.Cuomo administration officials want the upstate nuclear power plants to continue operating until 2030, when they hope that there will be enough sources of renewable energy to supply half of the state's needs, according to people who have been briefed on the matter. But Mr. Cuomo has taken an opposite stance on Entergy's Indian Point nuclear plant in Westchester County, which has two reactors.The governor has repeatedly called for Indian Point to be shut down, saying it is too dangerous to have a nuclear plant so close to a metropolis. It is perched on the edge of the Hudson River in Buchanan, about 30 miles north of Manhattan.""It's certainly a quandary,"" one of the people briefed on the matter, Gavin J. Donohue, the president of the Independent Power Producers of New York, said of Mr. Cuomo's positions on the upstate and downstate nuclear plants. ""It's clear that the governor is recognizing the value of upstate nuclear energy. That's a big change for the State of New York, and it's welcome news.""Mr. Donohue said he thought owners of power plants in the state would welcome Mr. Cuomo's mandate if it did not interfere too much with the market for power. ""What we're trying to get to is a market-based approach to solving climate-change issues,"" he said. ""We need to not have the government pick winners and losers.""Mr. Cuomo, who has positioned himself as a leader in the battle against climate change, announced an energy plan in June that drew praise from former Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Gore, a Democrat who has made drawing attention to global warming his signature cause, called the governor's proposed mandate ""a terrific and bold action,"" noting that it comes a week before the United Nations will hold a conference on climate change in Paris.""Governor Cuomo's commitment to expanding renewable energy and transforming the energy landscape in New York State reflects his longstanding leadership in the effort to solve the climate crisis,"" Mr. Gore said in a statement. ""And the timing couldn't be better. As we approach the global climate negotiations in Paris in just over a week, actions by state governments like New York State provide essential momentum toward a strong and effective agreement.""Rory M. Christian, the director of clean energy for the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, said that Mr. Cuomo's proposed mandate was similar to one that California's Legislature passed and Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed into law last month.""Yeah, it's an achievable goal,"" Mr. Christian said. ""We got a man to the moon; we can get to 50 percent renewable energy.""What effect the mandate will have on consumers' electric bills is ""a concern,"" Mr. Christian said. ""Rates are always going to be a concern,"" he said. But, he added, ""the key thing is more renewables will keep those costs from going up or stabilize them.""Renewable sources of energy like solar and wind power operate intermittently and not as reliably as plants fueled by gas, coal or nuclear. And encouraging the development of those sources may involve subsidies from ratepayers, the Cuomo administration official said.On the other hand, the state official said, ""This will actually avoid the sticker shock that ratepayers experience every time there is a fuel shortage, a power plant goes offline or there is a spike in energy costs.""Photograph The Robert E.

Motorola Solutions Chooses Silver Lake to Help Fund Transition Away From Radios:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"Motorola Solutions has been the target of several prominent investors over the years, notably the activists Carl C. Icahn and ValueAct Capital.Now the company, which makes public safety communications equipment, has another big investor as its partner of choice.Motorola Solutions plans to announce on Wednesday that it has taken a $1 billion investment from the private equity firm Silver Lake.The investment -- a so-called private investment in public equity, or PIPE, in the form of debt that can be converted into common stock -- is one of the biggest Silver Lake has made in its 16-year history, rivaling the $1.4 billion in cash it contributed to the management-led buyout of Dell two years ago.In seeking out Silver Lake, a specialist in technology deals that oversees $26 billion worth of assets, Motorola Solutions is hoping to accelerate a transition from selling only radios that police officers, fire departments and other emergency workers use, to a broader emergency communications platform.As Greg Brown, the company's chief executive, put it in a telephone interview, the aim is to provide all the information that is ""tactically useful"" to workers in an emergency situation.That means adding more complex software and other data services to Motorola Solutions' capabilities.Such a shift would be the latest in the company's recent evolution. Under pressure from Mr. Icahn, the billionaire investor, the company spun off its cellphone business in 2008 and focused on government and public safety customers.Soon after jettisoning the cellphone business, the company took on another activist, the hedge fund ValueAct Capital, which still has a representative on the board and owns a roughly 8 percent stake.Motorola Solutions has sold off a number of other operations over the years, including a corporate network division and an enterprise services unit.Since becoming a stand-alone operation, Motorola Solutions has grappled with ways to revive its business. Sales have stayed largely flat since 2011. The company had explored selling itself, but called off the process after finding no acceptable bids.Mr. Brown and his team have focused in recent years both on developing a platform for government worker communications and on cutting costs. They have slashed about $550 million in operating expenses over the last three years and have laid off about 35 percent of the company's work force since spinning off the handset business.""The shine is really starting to show,"" Mr. Brown said. ""I think this is an exciting inflection point for opportunity.""Shares of Motorola Solutions, whose market value as of Tuesday's close was about $12.6 billion, have risen 96 percent over the last five years.That combination of business prospects and moves toward efficiency helped draw in Silver Lake. And for Motorola Solutions, the investment firm's specialty in technology and supporting financial maneuvers like consolidation made it a natural choice.One of Silver Lake's previous investments was in Avago Technologies, a chip maker that the firm helped create and then invested in further. That helped pave the way for Avago to buy a rival, Broadcom, last spring, generating a huge paper profit for the investment shop.""What I liked in the engagement with the team at Silver Lake was their technology expertise, which I view as an accelerant and extension of our own efforts,"" Mr. Brown said.Executives from Motorola Solutions and Silver Lake began quietly negotiating several months ago, in each company's corporate offices and sometimes in more intimate environs. One meeting took place in May at the Bay Area home of Egon Durban, a Silver Lake managing partner, where Mr. Brown and his team half-jokingly insisted that a Chicago Bulls playoff game be on the television.As part of the deal, two top Silver Lake executives -- Mr. Durban and Greg Mondre -- will join Motorola Solutions' board.""Motorola Solutions is an iconic company and the global market leader in public safety technology,"" Mr. Durban and Mr. Mondre said in a statement. ""We believe it is creating a new era in data-rich public safety communications and has significant potential for growth. Its core business is unrivaled in the United States and around the world, with a broad and loyal customer base, an outstanding record of reliability and growing reach and scale driven by technology innovation.""The transaction is expected to close on Aug. 25.",0.0
Family Values:   [Style Desk ],,"LOS ANGELES -- The filmmaking brothers Paul and Chris Weitz, who have had their movie hits and misses since breaking through with the blockbuster 1999 teen sex comedy ""American Pie,"" had childhoods that resemble something out of a movie made by their friend Wes Anderson.The writer Tom Wolfe was a guest at the family dinner table. The Swedish auteur Ingmar Bergman once took them to the circus. And they spent many boyhood hours orchestrating elaborate skits with their collection of stuffed animals (which included twin alligators and a duck made of socks), who sipped cocktails and had turf wars at a make-believe club fashioned after the El Morocco, a once glamorous nightspot near the Weitz family's Park Avenue apartment.The brothers described their unusual provenance during an interview at the office they share in the Venice section of Los Angeles, not far from where they live with their wives and children.""I was four years older, and Chris was certainly his own person,"" said Paul, 49, who has tousled gray hair. ""But we were close.""Chris, 45, has a scholarly Clark Kent demeanor. ""We were a resistance unit,"" he said, laughing.""Essentially, we had a provincial upbringing in the middle of a huge city,"" Paul said.Their father, the clothing designer John Weitz, who left Nazi Germany as a teenager, made a grand living in fashion and went on to write novels and biographies of men in Hitler's inner circle.""Wes told me once he used to have a John Weitz blazer that somehow made its way onto Jason Schwartzman's character in 'Rushmore,' "" said Paul, referring to the oddball protagonist of Mr. Anderson's 1998 film.The mother of the Weitz brothers, Susan Kohner, was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in Douglas Sirk's 1959 film ""Imitation of Life."" She retired from show business when she settled down with Mr. Weitz, and often traveled with her sons to their grandparents' house in Los Angeles, where Chris and Paul roasted marshmallows by the patio fireplace in the company of ""actors with European accents,"" as Chris put it, like Yul Brynner and Liv Ullmann.Their maternal grandfather, Paul Kohner, a Czech émigré, was a talent agent who represented Greta Garbo and Billy Wilder; their maternal grandmother is the screen actress Lupita Tovar, who left Mexico in the days of the early talkies and remained close to old friends like the painter Diego Rivera.As children, Paul and Chris sometimes annoyed their old-school father with their constant performances. ""Once I remember being in London,"" Paul said, ""and Chris and me were little kids doing some shtick. We were interviewing pigeons on the street and we wouldn't stop. I remember Dad saying, 'It's so booor-ring!' It was an early piece of dramatic criticism.""Their high jinks had a choreographed flair. They pilfered sugar packets from restaurants while pretending to be spies carrying out a secret mission called Operation White Gold, and a brief period of light shoplifting hinted at their literary leanings.""We did go through a book-swiping phase,"" Chris said. ""To be fair, they were paperbacks. Anything larger wouldn't fit into our 8-year-old trouser pockets.""""I took Bruce Tegner's 'Complete Book of Self-Defense,' which taught me how to flip people over,"" Paul said.""I remember stealing a William Steig book,"" Chris said.""I don't remember that,"" Paul said, looking at his brother, puzzled. ""We lived near this bookstore called the Madison Avenue Bookshop, and a lovely man ran it.""Chris said he didn't recall stealing anything from that store.""I might have once or twice,"" Paul said. ""For all I know, he actually knew and billed our parents.""As a teenager, Paul used to doctor the grades on his report cards, turning minuses into pluses. Sometimes he wandered through the Metropolitan Museum of Art high on ""stimulants"" that he procured in Central Park, he said.Chris pursued more patrician activities. As a youth he joined Manhattan's Knickerbocker Greys, an after-school marching corps founded in 1881 ""for boys of the scions of New York upper crust families,"" as he described it. He went to a London boarding school when he was 14, but remained popular among New York's cotillion set.When it came time for the brothers to embark on a career, their Manhattan upbringing and childhood habit of creating imaginary worlds together came in handy: They were the co-writers (along with Todd Alcott) the screenplay for the 1998 animated film ""Antz,"" which was set in a place they knew well, Central Park, with a hero voiced by Woody Allen.After they directed ""American Pie"" (with Chris as an uncredited director), they wrote and directed ""About a Boy."" The screenplay was nominated for an Oscar. Then they went their separate ways as writers and directors for more than a decade.In that time, the older brother, Paul, wrote plays and directed movies, among them ""In Good Company,"" ""American Dreamz"" and ""Little Fockers."" His latest is ""Grandma,"" which comes out this month.Chris, in the meantime, wrote and directed ""The Golden Compass""; directed ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon""; and wrote two young-adult novels (including the newly published ""The New Order""), as well as the script for a ""Star Wars"" spinoff movie, ""Star Wars Anthology: Rogue One,"" which is now in production.""For me,"" Paul said, ""there is some element of joy in the erasure of self when you are working.""Chris added similar sentiments: ""There is nothing better than directing a movie that is going well.""The brothers left their Venice office in separate cars and navigated heavy traffic on the way to the Bel Air home of their grandmother, now 105. She was resting when they went inside, but their mother, who has two Golden Globe awards and an Oscar nomination, was there to greet them.""I like your haircut,"" she told Chris, sweeping a lock of hair from his forehead.He stared blankly ahead.Ms. Kohner, who was visiting from New York, went on to recall how her boys used to make fun of her performance in ""Imitation of Life."" ""They used to do the thing from 'Imitation,' the dance,"" she said. ""They did it just to annoy me.""The brothers laughed knowingly. ""Mom had this striptease in 'Imitation' where her character sings, 'The loneliest word I've ever heard is empty,' "" Paul said.The song from the movie was ""Empty Arms,"" and Paul began to sing it while Chris retreated to the kitchen.If the brothers' films have a common thread, it may be in their exploration of relationships between men, which Chris chalked up to ""daddy issues we had to deal with.""Their father was an unusually accomplished man who, during World War II (before his success as a designer and author) served in the Office of Strategic Services, a forerunner of the C.I.A. He was an affectionate presence, but he set a high bar.""He took the level of a perceived insult -- walking around with torn jeans -- to a new level,"" Paul said.Mr. Weitz also bluntly doled out fatherly wisdom. When Chris fretted over a girl who wasn't returning his calls, he said his father told him, ""If somebody doesn't call you, it's because they don't want to talk to you.""But he supported the artistic choices of his sons, even among friends who disapproved of the notorious scene in ""American Pie"" where a lusty teenager makes novel use of an apple pastry. ""Dad was out in Sag Harbor,"" Chris recalled, ""and some other older gentleman came up to him and disparagingly said, 'I bet you are very proud of your sons.' And our dad said, 'Haven't you ever masturbated before?' ""Chris and Paul looked at each other and laughed.""I don't know where the conversation went from there,"" Paul said.""There is nowhere to go,"" Chris replied, chuckling.These days, even when they're not working together, the brothers give each other advice and encouragement. ""We do look at each other's films and give each other notes,"" Paul said. ""I can remember when I was slightly on the ropes about something professionally, feeling bad about myself, and Chris wrote me a postcard. On the back it read, 'You are going to win.' It was subconsciously childish, but I really took it to heart. I kept it in my sock drawer.""Chris said, ""When you are in the middle of these movies, they tend to eat your life.""He understands this better than most, given his experience making ""The Golden Compass,"" a $180 million epic starring Nicole Kidman, based on the first novel in Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy. The movie was controversial from the start; skittish executives demanded modifications to its skeptical view of organized religion and asked for a more upbeat ending.""Those books came to me at a tremendously important time in my life,"" said Chris, whose father, an atheist of Jewish lineage, had died not long before he got to work on the script. ""To be, sort of, not delivering a good enough version was really difficult for me.""""The Golden Compass"" faltered at the domestic box office, and no sequels followed. ""In terms of career stuff, it was tough,"" Chris said, ""because everything had been coming up roses up until that point for me, for us.""Now the brothers are collaborating again, this time with Steven Spielberg, who hired them to write an adaptation of the Japanese film ""Like Father, Like Son,"" which took the Jury Prize at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.""We grew up being drilled into politeness,"" Paul said. ""It is a great tool in Hollywood and a great tool in collaboration, because 'You are an idiot' is a lot worse to hear than 'You are really wonderful, and you've done something idiotic.' ""Chris gave his brother a skeptical look. ""We don't really talk to each other that way,"" he said.""Yeah,"" Paul said, with a laugh. ""That was all metaphorical speech.""Photograph Chris Weitz, Left, and Paul Weitz in the Bel Air Section of Los Angeles, at the Home of Their Grandmother Lupita Tovar, 105, an Actress in Early Talkies.

Jets Linebacker Carries New Load as Fullback:   [Sports Desk ],,"FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- Like many players in high school, Julian Howsare started on both sides of the ball, though for college he had to choose. The coaches at Clarion University projected him as a defensive end, so that was where he played, demoralizing quarterbacks with an array of speed rushes and spin moves.Part of him yearned to play offense again -- whenever the Golden Eagles possessed the ball near the goal line, Howsare would badger the offensive coordinator, Chris Weibel, to let him run it in -- but by the end of a career studded with awards and accolades, he had begun attracting interest from some N.F.L. teams.One was the Jets, who, projecting him as an outside linebacker in their 3-4 scheme, signed him soon after the draft. Howsare's intelligence, athleticism and aggressive temperament appealed to them, and it was those attributes that prompted Coach Todd Bowles to seek him out for a conversation Sunday and pose a potentially life-altering question just before defensive meetings were about to start: How would you like to play fullback?Of course he would, Howsare said, and the transformation began at once. He hunkered down with his tablet and started studying the offensive playbook so that he would at least know where to line up. In his locker appeared a white pinnie -- the color worn by offensive players -- that he would have to slip over his green jersey. While linebackers practiced their coverage skills, he huddled with the running backs, performing agility drills and catching passes and evading tackling dummies.""It's another opportunity for me to show what I can do,"" Howsare said.As one of 90 players on a roster that must be whittled to 53 by Sept. 5, Howsare finds himself in the predicament of trying to make the team at a position he last played five years ago, as a senior at Altoona High School in Pennsylvania. As it has been explained to him, the switch is temporary but indefinite.The Jets still consider him a linebacker -- ""Make no mistake about that,"" Bowles said -- but they are intrigued enough by his prospects that he will take reps at fullback until further notice.""Sometimes you don't know what you have until you take a shot at it,"" General Manager Mike Maccagnan said in an interview.For Maccagnan, the idea started percolating during off-season workouts, when it struck him how much Howsare looked like a fullback. Unlike taller, more linear outside linebackers, Howsare, listed as 6 feet 3 inches and 255 pounds, carries his weight through his lower body and legs. In pedigree and in size, he reminded Maccagnan of another defensive end-turned-N.F.L. fullback who played at a smaller college, James Develin of New England.""Watching him as a linebacker roll his hips and take on blockers, you start thinking of it in reverse,"" Maccagnan said of Howsare. ""If he's a fullback and going into the line of scrimmage and uncoiling on contact, he had the flexibility and athletic ability.""The fullback's role has changed over the years, evolving from that of a pure lead blocker -- almost like an extra guard -- to, as spread offenses have infiltrated the league, another pass-catching threat out of the backfield. According to Pro Football Focus, the Jets deployed a fullback on 19.1 percent of their offensive snaps last season, but Bowles said he and coordinator Chan Gailey had yet to determine how often they would use one.""It's not a natural position,"" said the Jets' likely starter, Tommy Bohanon. ""It's not natural to run 5 yards and hit a linebacker square in the face.""The running-5-yards-and-hitting part comes naturally to Howsare. He recorded 39 sacks and 57 tackles for a loss at Clarion, about 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, and developed a reputation as such a dogged and ferocious player that the conference rival California University of Pennsylvania started referring to him as the Chain Saw (when the Cal graduate Rontez Miles learned that Howsare had joined the team, he said, he ran around the Jets' complex asking: ""Where's Chain Saw? Where's Chain Saw?"" until he found him). As a senior, Howsare was selected as a finalist for the award given to the best lineman -- offensive or defensive -- in Division II.""There was no one that could block him,"" Weibel, now the head coach at Clarion, said in a telephone interview. ""There was no one that would put forth the effort or match his effort on the field.""It is everything else that commands a recalibration. However similar Howsare views the responsibilities, the differences greet him every time he lines up.Instead of having the freedom to pursue the ball any way he chooses, he must harness his aggression. If a guard misses a block, Howsare must prevent the play from breaking down before he can proceed to his assignment. If the ball carrier cannot make it back to the line of scrimmage, that, in essence, is Howsare's fault.""The hardest part is really just the flow of the game and learning how to get into the holes and get into your blocks,"" said Bohanon, who switched to fullback from running back as a freshman at Wake Forest. ""It's something you definitely have to learn over a few years.""Howsare does not have a few years. He has a few weeks. The more he can do, Bowles told him, the more appealing he becomes for the Jets or potential employers elsewhere, who will determine the position that fits him best.Whichever position that is.Photograph Linebacker Julian Howsare, Right, Received Pointers Wednesday From Fullback Tommy Bohanon.

Penalties for a Payment Processor:   [Real Estate Desk ],,"Many lenders promote biweekly payment plans as a way to pay down mortgages more quickly. But the programs can sometimes be costly, and, as federal regulators recently found, may promise borrowers more than they actually deliver.Last month, Paymap, a payment processing company and wholly owned subsidiary of Western Union, agreed to return $33.4 million in fees to consumers and pay a $5 million fine in an action brought by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.The bureau charged that Paymap of Englewood, Colo., in partnership with LoanCare, a mortgage servicer in Virginia Beach, marketed an Equity Accelerator program to borrowers by grossly overstating how much they would save in interest by paying their mortgage on a biweekly basis.Paying half the mortgage every other week for a total of 26 payments a year results in 13 full mortgage payments annually instead of the 12 required. This can indeed help borrowers pay off their loans early.But Paymap, on a website and through its employees, oversold the benefits of its program, claiming average interest savings of more than $33,000 without any data to back up the claim, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In reality, the bureau said, ""only a tiny percentage, if any"" of the roughly 125,000 consumers who enrolled in the program over the last four years enjoyed that level of savings.Consumers typically paid a fee of $295 to sign up for the program, essentially an electronic payment system that automatically withdrew money from their bank accounts. Paymap charged a transaction fee of $2.50 for every automatic withdrawal, fees it shared with partner servicers. LoanCare received an estimated $400,000 in customer fees from the program, the bureau said.The bureau also faulted Paymap for telling consumers that their new mortgage payoff schedule would be ""every two weeks."" Even though Paymap withdrew money every two weeks, it didn't transfer the funds to the mortgage servicer until the beginning of the month, the bureau said. The payment schedule did not change.In a statement, the bureau's director, Richard Cordray, said the action against the two companies was intended to send ""a clear message that these practices will not be tolerated.""LoanCare will pay a fine of $100,000. The two companies neither admit nor deny wrongdoing, according to the consent orders.Margot Freeman Saunders, of counsel to the National Consumer Law Center, said she welcomed the bureau's action. The companies charge borrowers to do something they can do on their own, she said, and potentially put them at risk of incurring additional costs, as ""third-party payment companies don't have the same interest you do in preventing late fees.""Rather than paying a company to make additional payments, borrowers should make a habit of sending in extra money on their own, she advised. One way to achieve the same result as a biweekly plan -- making one additional full payment a year -- is to increase the monthly payment by one-twelfth, and specify that the extra be applied to the principal balance. In other words, if the monthly payment is $1,200, pay an additional $100 a month toward the principal, for a total of $1,300.Borrowers can also try a technique Ms. Saunders used: Give your mortgage a raise. If she received, say, a 5 percent pay increase, she raised her mortgage payment by 5 percent. By tacking on a ""raise"" of $50 to $75 a month, ""I paid off my mortgage in 18 years rather than 30,"" she said.Chart Index for Adjustable Rate Mortgages: 1-Year Treasury Rate (Source: Hsh.Com)",0.0

They Can't Be Serious:   Commentary,,"This was, according to many commentators, going to be the election cycle Republicans got to show off their ""deep bench."" The race for the nomination would include experienced governors like Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, fresh thinkers like Rand Paul, and attractive new players like Marco Rubio. Instead, however, Donald Trump leads the field by a wide margin. What happened?The answer, according to many of those who didn't see it coming, is gullibility: People can't tell the difference between someone who sounds as if he knows what he's talking about and someone who is actually serious about the issues. And for sure there's a lot of gullibility out there. But if you ask me, the pundits have been at least as gullible as the public, and still are.For while it's true that Mr. Trump is, fundamentally, an absurd figure, so are his rivals. If you pay attention to what any one of them is actually saying, as opposed to how he says it, you discover incoherence and extremism every bit as bad as anything Mr. Trump has to offer. And that's not an accident: Talking nonsense is what you have to do to get anywhere in today's Republican Party.For example, Mr. Trump's economic views, a sort of mishmash of standard conservative talking points and protectionism, are definitely confused. But is that any worse than Jeb Bush's deep voodoo, his claim that he could double the underlying growth rate of the American economy? And Mr. Bush's credibility isn't helped by his evidence for that claim: the relatively rapid growth Florida experienced during the immense housing bubble that coincided with his time as governor.Mr. Trump, famously, is a ""birther"" -- someone who has questioned whether President Obama was born in the United States. But is that any worse than Scott Walker's declaration that he isn't sure whether the president is a Christian?Mr. Trump's declared intention to deport all illegal immigrants is definitely extreme, and would require deep violations of civil liberties. But are there any defenders of civil liberties in the modern G.O.P.? Notice how eagerly Rand Paul, self-described libertarian, has joined in the witch hunt against Planned Parenthood.And while Mr. Trump is definitely appealing to know-nothingism, Marco Rubio, climate change denier, has made ""I'm not a scientist"" his signature line. (Memo to Mr. Rubio: Presidents don't have to be experts on everything, but they do need to listen to experts, and decide which ones to believe.)The point is that while media puff pieces have portrayed Mr. Trump's rivals as serious men -- Jeb the moderate, Rand the original thinker, Marco the face of a new generation -- their supposed seriousness is all surface. Judge them by positions as opposed to image, and what you have is a lineup of cranks. And as I said, this is no accident.It has long been obvious that the conventions of political reporting and political commentary make it almost impossible to say the obvious -- namely, that one of our two major parties has gone off the deep end. Or as the political analysts Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein put it in their book ""It's Even Worse Than It Looks,"" the G.O.P. has become an ""insurgent outlier ... unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence, and science."" It's a party that has no room for rational positions on many major issues.Or to put it another way, modern Republican politicians can't be serious -- not if they want to win primaries and have any future within the party. Crank economics, crank science, crank foreign policy are all necessary parts of a candidate's resume.Until now, however, leading Republicans have generally tried to preserve a facade of respectability, helping the news media to maintain the pretense that it was dealing with a normal political party. What distinguishes Mr. Trump is not so much his positions as it is his lack of interest in maintaining appearances. And it turns out that the party's base, which demands extremist positions, also prefers those positions delivered straight. Why is anyone surprised?Remember how Mr. Trump was supposed to implode after his attack on John McCain? Mr. McCain epitomizes the strategy of sounding moderate while taking extreme positions, and is much loved by the press corps, which puts him on TV all the time. But Republican voters, it turns out, couldn't care less about him.Can Mr. Trump actually win the nomination? I have no idea. But even if he is eventually pushed aside, pay no attention to all the analyses you will read declaring a return to normal politics. That's not going to happen; normal politics left the G.O.P. a long time ago. At most, we'll see a return to normal hypocrisy, the kind that cloaks radical policies and contempt for evidence in conventional-sounding rhetoric. And that won't be an improvement.",0.0
Debates on Campus:   [Letter ],,"Readers discuss the controversies over free speech and safe spaces on college campuses.To the Editor: Re ""A Crisis Our Universities Deserve"" (column, Nov. 15): Ross Douthat's diatribe against American higher education since the 1960s is, from my experience and observation, simply wrong. Previously higher education was to a very large extent exclusionary, sectarian, tribal, hierarchical, intolerant and dogmatic.Today the vastly variegated panorama of American higher education has by no means reached a state of perfection, but it is more humane by far, filled with students and faculty who listen to one another across large areas of difference, know the value of hard work in an uncertain world and with uncertain personal futures, and are keenly aware of the opportunities and threats that almost fantastical technological change poses.There is substantial evidence that the more exposure to higher education that people today have received, the less likely they are to be susceptible to demagogy and denial of evidence and proven facts; and they are more capable of changing their prejudice-based opinions, and in general better prepared to join in the long effort to make a better world out of the crooked timber of humanity.In an often-daunting world and future, our colleges and universities, contrary to Mr. Douthat's dark vision of corruption and rot, are a major source of hope and confidence.THOMAS H. WRIGHTVieques, P.R.The writer is emeritus vice president and secretary of Princeton University.To the Editor: The two universities I have taught at -- San Diego State University and the University of California at Los Angeles -- bear no resemblance to the generic university that Ross Douthat conjures up. American culture has changed in the half century since the 1960s, and college administrators, along with faculty members and staff, reflect those changes. This is not a descent from virtue. Nowhere does Mr. Douthat make an argument for his assertion that universities are ""genuinely corrupt.""Yes, students want to have a good time, but such a desire is not incompatible with serious study. Contemporary students may not share Mr. Douthat's values, but they are concerned with refining and sharing their own moral vision, and they prefer the dynamism of life to the ossification of old norms.JOYCE APPLEBYTaos, N.M.To the Editor: Re ""The Seduction of Safety,"" by Roxane Gay (Sunday Review, Nov. 15):As a first-year student at a dominantly ""liberal"" university, I believe that we place far too much emphasis on making safe spaces for everyone. Growing up in a world that has suddenly demanded that we watch our language, opinions and even questioning of socially sensitive topics like homosexuality and feminism, many youths such as myself have a tough time expressing our opinions under the social pressure to be ""politically correct.""Safe spaces are designed to allow individual thoughts to flow freely without judgment. I have found they have done the exact opposite. I often find myself clamming up when asked to share an opinion I feel strongly about, simply because it could be considered critical or judgmental of others' opinions.We should always be respectful of all opinions and beliefs, but we should not have to be afraid to share our own, even if they seem ""politically incorrect.""CHRISTOPHER PHILIPPS>ChicagoTo the Editor: Roxane Gay dismisses the perspective of those who criticize the notion of safe spaces as resulting from being able to take one's safety for granted. However, one person's safe space is another person's hostile environment. The adversities that exist in our world are not as simplistic and one-sided as she makes them out to be. There are men who are victims of domestic violence and rape. There are white people who grow up in poverty or have lost a family member to violence at the hands of a police officer. There are heterosexuals who have been perceived by others as gay and suffered from homophobia.Unfortunately, there are those who would seek to make the world a supposed safe space for women, minorities or L.G.B.T. people by suppressing the voices of others who have experienced comparable adversities, thereby denying the very real suffering that they have endured. The way to achieve true healing for everyone is by hearing one another's perspectives with empathy and seeking to find common ground, not by silencing the voices of those whose life stories we find inconvenient or uncomfortable.DAVID GOLUB>New YorkTo the Editor: Re ""Mizzou, Yale and Free Speech,"" by Nicholas Kristof (column, Nov. 12), and ""Who Is Entitled to Be Heard?,"" by Suzanne Nossel (Op-Ed, Nov. 12):While both Mr. Kristof and Ms. Nossel have thoughtful comments on what sort of speech or acts should be allowed on college campuses, I'd urge them both to draw sharper distinctions between insult and opinion. Because most colleges and universities require admitted students to agree to a code of conduct that respects their fellow students, it is perfectly proper to punish students who break that code by use of the N-word, posting lynching cartoons on the door of a black student or wearing insensitive Halloween costumes on university property. Conversely, no student should be barred from a public meeting, no speaker shouted down and no ""Vagina Monologues"" type of performance canceled. Here students may dissent but not disrupt.This distinction gets a little trickier when protests arise over graduation speakers such as Condoleezza Rice or Christine Lagarde, director of the International Monetary Fund. Commencement is not a regular campus event, but rather a special time for all seniors to celebrate regardless of their political views. Here the distinction between insult and opinion is harder to draw, and thus requires us all to think compassionately about a thoroughly complex issue.PETER K. FROST>Williamstown, Mass.The writer is emeritus professor of international relations at Williams College.To the Editor: Nicholas Kristof says ""universities should work harder to make all students feel they are safe and belong."" Nonsense. Such sloppy sentimentality underscores the misdirection of many of our universities and undermines the values that define adult education. No student at an American university should be ""safe"" from ideas, be they noxious or untrue.Higher education is ""higher"" precisely because the best teachers take very great risks in challenging ideas that seem self-evident, even the risk of changing minds. As for belonging, all students were admitted and by definition belong.Safe from violence, yes.

Graft Panel in Malaysia Issues Ruling for Premier:   [Foreign Desk ],,"HONG KONG -- Malaysia's anticorruption body said Monday that nearly $700 million deposited into accounts controlled by Prime Minister Najib Razak did not come from a government-owned development fund now under investigation.Instead, the money came from ""contributions of donors,"" the Malaysian Anticorruption Commission said in a written statement, which did not offer specifics.Mr. Najib has been under scrutiny since news reports said last month that investigators had documented the flow of hundreds of millions of dollars into accounts under his control.Last week, he dismissed the attorney general and reshuffled the cabinet, removing a deputy who had publicly urged him to respond to questions over 1Malaysia Development Berhad, the development fund, which has $11 billion in debt.Mr. Najib has called the suggestions of corruption the work of political opponents trying to undermine him. He and the fund, also known as 1MDB, have denied wrongdoing.The task force looking into the fund includes the anticorruption commission, the attorney general, the inspector general of Malaysia's police and the governor general of the central bank.The anticorruption commission said it would forward to the attorney general the results of its investigation into the money that had gone into the prime minister's accounts.The political storm around Mr. Najib is likely to continue despite the announcement by anticorruption officials. In recent days, officials with his party, the United Malays National Organization, and the governing coalition have said that as party president, he is a trustee authorized to handle political donations. But the former prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, a onetime mentor turned critic of Mr. Najib, wrote on his blog on Monday that the hundreds of millions reported seemed far more than necessary for campaign expenses. Dr. Mahathir said that when he was president of the party, he never had election funds deposited into his personal accounts.Also on Monday, the Malaysian police interviewed Bahri Mohamad Zin, the anticorruption commission's director of special operations, as part of an investigation into leaks of documents related to the 1MDB inquiry, according to Malaysian news reports.Mr. Bahri is the fourth official from the anticorruption body to be questioned in the leak investigation, The Malaysian Insider website and The Malay Mail Online reported. A former adviser and an official in the attorney general's office working with the anticorruption commission were detained over the weekend as part of the leak inquiry, the outlets said.The leak investigation follows articles by The Wall Street Journal and Sarawak Report, a British website, that said investigators had documents that showed hundreds of millions of dollars had flowed into accounts controlled by the prime minister.",0.0
Greece Faces Another Crisis as Migration Surges:   [Foreign Desk ],,"LESBOS, Greece -- The immigration center here, a cluster of prefabricated buildings surrounded by rows of chain-link and barbed-wire fences, was full again on a recent evening, leaving hundreds of families, some with infants, to find a place among the piles of garbage outside.The toilets were clogged and the temperatures still well above 90 degrees. Flies and mosquitoes were everywhere.""Look, her eyes are sick,"" said Ibrahim Nawrozi, a desperate 27-year-old Afghan mechanic, holding up his 10-month-old daughter for inspection. ""We are in this garbage three days. We can't stay here another day.""Since the beginning of the year, the number of refugees and migrants arriving here and on other Greek islands has surged to full-scale humanitarian-crisis levels. Arrivals by sea have surpassed 107,000 through July, according to United Nations figures, eclipsing even the numbers of people reaching Italy. Most of those who arrive on the shores of Lesbos, a popular tourist destination just off the coast of Turkey in the Aegean Sea, are fleeing the wars in Syria and Afghanistan and hoping to head deeper into Western Europe.In June, 15,254 migrants and refugees arrived on Lesbos, according to the Greek Coast Guard, compared with 921 the same month last year.But only squalor awaits them here. They arrive in a country that is deep in its own crisis, with an unemployment rate over 25 percent, banks not fully open and its government all but broke.There are volunteers, both tourists and Greeks, scraping together what assistance they can, offering crackers, water and sometimes dry clothes. But what they muster does not come close to the need. Some of the families outside the center had been unable to get any food that day, elbowed out of the way by others, they said. Some who had gotten food said it made them sick. Human rights groups have called the conditions here and on other nearby islands appalling.Spyros Galinos, the mayor of Lesbos, agrees that conditions are ""awful."" But he said the scale of the problem had been mind-boggling, with 1,500 people arriving on some days.""We had 3,000 people outside the center the other day,"" he said.The migrants and refugees land at all hours, packed into inflatable boats that should hold 15, according to the manufacturer's instructions stamped clearly on the side of boats. But they usually hold 40, sometimes more. They cross from Turkey, where they have paid smugglers about $1,200 for a place on the boat, more if they want life jackets.The distance is as little as three and a half miles in some places. But the overloaded boats, taking in water because they sit so low in the sea, can take hours to make the crossings. Passengers that arrive in the night are often exhausted and freezing. Others arrive sunburned. Some end up throwing everything they own overboard, even wheelchairs.Still, the volunteers who watch for the boats from cliffs say that many of the passengers fall to their knees with happiness when they make it to the rocky beaches here.It was that way for Rosh A., a 32-year-old Syrian teacher, who asked not to be identified by her last name for fear of what might happen to her family back home on the outskirts of Damascus. Rosh said she had made the trip in less than 24 hours, flying to Beirut, Lebanon, and to Istanbul before climbing into an inflatable boat with her two children and three friends. In Damascus, she said, the bombs arrived regularly and basic services were gone.""I was dying there every day,"" she said, as one of her traveling companions used his smartphone to show a video of explosions and fires erupting in the suburbs of the city. ""Yes, it was frightening in that boat, but when I got in it I had a future again.""Once ashore, however, the group faced a 30-mile walk to register with the authorities. The roads are filled day and night with refugees and migrants trudging toward the port town of Mitilini. Some, like Mr. Nawrozi's wife, get so exhausted carrying their children that they abandon their belongings along the road.It is a measure of how few official services there are that those who are rescued by the Coast Guard in the north of the island are brought to Melinda McRostie, who, with her husband, runs a restaurant called the Captain's Table in the nearby town of Molyvos.With donations solicited from a Facebook page, Ms. McRostie has rented a space behind the rows of restaurants overlooking the port. On a recent evening, as tourists chatted, ate grilled fish and tried ouzo out front, 33 young men from Afghanistan, many with blistered lips, were lining up for turkey and cheese sandwiches in the back.Afterward, they bedded down for the night on plastic sheeting. By early morning, another group of 100 Syrians had arrived, one man suffering from hypothermia.""Me,"" Ms. McRostie said, ""I was dealing with it, like I know anything about what to do. We were trying to get his wet clothes off and I think now he was really embarrassed. This morning he wouldn't look at me.""For many residents of the island, the wave of migrants and refugees could hardly come at a worse time of year. The tourist season is in full swing, and restaurants and hotels here depend on the summer months to stay in business. Even those who are volunteering to help the new arrivals are eager to point out that tourists will find the island unchanged. That is true to a large degree. But in the north, the beaches are littered with deflated boats and piles of abandoned life jackets and inflatable tubes.About 60 percent of the arrivals are from Syria. The next largest group, making up about 20 percent, are Afghans. But there are also arrivals from Somalia, Congo, Eritrea and Pakistan, among others.Few stay on the island for very long. The authorities have stepped up the processing of papers so that most can take a ferry -- at their own expense -- to the mainland within three or four days. From there, most say they will make their way out of Greece, through Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary to Austria and beyond. Many hope to go to Germany, Sweden, Denmark or Norway.The authorities have set up two encampments, but they are not managed in any way. There is nobody to settle disputes or answer questions about the constantly changing system of processing papers. Police officers can arrive at any time to hand out papers, but they do not even have a bullhorn, so people often fear that they have not heard their names being called.Rosh and her children have their papers, for instance, as do two of her traveling companions. But the sixth member of the group has not received his papers and they have no idea why, or any means of finding out. So, they wait, settled in the stifling heat by a tree that they joke is their air-conditioner.""You know,"" Rosh said, ""I never even had to worry about money a day in my life before.""At the registration center, a police major, Kostas Papazoglou, said that the staff was overwhelmed, but that there were no reinforcements to be had.The police, he said, were paying for food, but on a budget of less than 6 euros, or about $6.60, per person per day. There was no money for clearing the garbage from the area or tending to the toilets.""Ten days ago, there were 2,000 people here,"" he said. ""And the Syrians had closed the road in protest, a fight had broken out up top in the encampment and there was a fire. We had 10 officers here trying to deal with all of that.""Anastasia Christodoulopoulou, Greece's minister of migration policy, said she hoped to start receiving more funds from the European Union soon. The country, she said, did not have the resources to do much on its own, with so many Greeks struggling themselves.""I mean, there is a humanitarian crisis here, with 1.5 million unemployed, with three million poor, with homeless people, and we are not able to cover their basic needs,"" she said. ""And in this situation, we are called to also cover the needs of people who are even weaker.""But some on Lesbos say Greeks must summon the means to help despite their own suffering. The Rev. Stratis Dimou, a Greek Orthodox priest who has provided a way station for hundreds of immigrants walking the 30 miles from the north of the island to south, said there were perhaps 100 Greek families in his town, which was once prosperous from construction work, who now depend on charity to survive.Yet, Father Dimou said, additional efforts must still be made to help the new arrivals. ""These people are just trying to take care of themselves,"" he said. ""They are just trying to survive.""He said that one day a woman had become separated from her husband, so he took her in his car to search for him.""When we found him,"" Father Dimou said, ""he came over to my car. He bowed and he kissed me, and at that moment I realized there are no borders.""Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

A Word Too Far? 'Blood' Remark Tests the G.O.P.:   [National Desk ],,"Donald J. Trump's suggestion that a Fox News journalist had questioned him forcefully at the Republican presidential debate because she was menstruating cost him a speaking slot Saturday night at an influential gathering of conservatives in Atlanta. It also raised new questions about how much longer Republican Party leaders would have to contend with Mr. Trump's disruptive presence in the primary field.Continuing his complaints about Megyn Kelly, one of the moderators of the debate, in an interview on CNN Friday night, Mr. Trump said, ""You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever."" The remark prompted Erick Erickson, the leader of RedState, the conservative group, to disinvite him.""If your standard-bearer has to resort to that,"" Mr. Erickson told hundreds of conservative activists in a packed Atlanta hotel ballroom on Saturday, ""we need a new standard-bearer.""With Mr. Trump at center stage Thursday in Cleveland, Fox News shattered television viewership records for a primary debate: Nearly 24 million people watched. But any hopes that Mr. Trump, the real estate developer and television celebrity, would try to reinvent himself as a sober-minded statesman, or that he would collapse under scrutiny and tough questions, vaporized in the opening minutes when he refused to rule out running as an independent candidate for president. His remarks Friday only furthered the impression that he also had no intention of speaking more carefully. Mr. Trump denied on Saturday that he had been implying that Ms. Kelly was menstruating. ""I think only a degenerate would think that I would have meant that,"" he said in an interview, insisting that he had been referring to Ms. Kelly's nose and ears.But as his latest eruption rippled through Republican circles, the conversation turned to whether the party, and his rival presidential contenders, should continue to accommodate his candidacy, quietly hoping that this would be the moment he burned out -- or whether they should try to run him out on a rail.If party leaders saw danger in provoking a breakup -- and no small advantage to be seized from the ratings bonanza Mr. Trump showed himself capable of delivering -- there were signs that other influential Republicans would tolerate only so much of Mr. Trump's behavior.""Come on,"" Jeb Bush, who has campaigned as the adult among the party's 17 presidential candidates, said in his remarks at the RedState gathering. ""Give me a break. Do we want to win? Do we want to insult 53 percent of all voters? What Donald Trump said is wrong.""Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, who delivered perhaps the most assertive turn in Thursday's debate among the candidates trailing in the polls, posted on Twitter: ""Mr. Trump: There. Is. No. Excuse."" Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina went further, saying, ""Enough already with Mr. Trump.""Yet in a sign of the lingering reluctance among some in the field to anger Mr. Trump's supporters, other candidates, including former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, would not condemn Mr. Trump's comments.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, in an interview to be broadcast Sunday, praised Ms. Kelly but stopped short of calling on Mr. Trump to apologize. ""I've made a decision here with Donald Trump, you know, if I comment on everything he says, my whole campaign will be consumed by it,"" he said. ""That's all I'll do all day.""Mr. Rubio made the comments to Chuck Todd in a taped interview for NBC's ""Meet the Press.""Mr. Erickson -- an author with his own track record of inflammatory remarks, sometimes about women -- announced just before midnight Friday on the RedState website that he was disinviting Mr. Trump. He wrote that he admired Mr. Trump for his bluntness and for connecting with ""so much of the anger in the Republican base.""""But there are even lines blunt talkers and unprofessional politicians should not cross,"" he wrote. ""Decency is one of those lines.""He added, ""I just don't want someone on stage who gets a hostile question from a lady and his first inclination is to imply it was hormonal.""Mr. Trump's campaign shot back at Mr. Erickson, calling him a ""weak and pathetic leader"" and his decision ""another example of weakness through being politically correct.""But on Saturday, Mr. Trump seemed to recognize that he needed to create a diversion from the latest controversy and declared that he had fired Roger Stone, a Republican strategist and mischief-maker who had long been an adviser. But Mr. Stone said in an interview that he had resigned because the tenor of the campaign was distracting from Mr. Trump's core message.In an interview with The New York Times on Friday afternoon, before he went on CNN, Mr. Trump said he was irritated by the debate moderators' questions about a third-party candidacy, saying he wanted to run as a Republican, but he reiterated his threat to mount one if he is unhappy with his treatment by party leaders. An independent candidacy would be complicated and costly, he said, but ""if you're rich, it's doable.""Some Republicans were trying to determine just who was rallying to Mr. Trump's side, and how damaging it would be if his supporters left the party's fold.""Trump isn't and wasn't going to get the conservative vote,"" Joseph W. McQuaid, publisher of the Union Leader newspaper in New Hampshire, said in an email. ""Conservative Republicans are worried about their party, but it's still their party. Trump isn't philosophically a conservative, and that will come out.""""Trump's base is more the people who used to have season tickets to the Roman Colosseum,"" Mr. McQuaid wrote. ""Not sure that they vote in great numbers, but they like blood sport.""But others on the right said the disaffected voters rallying to Mr. Trump represented a constituency that Republicans would be foolish to ignore.""People have to get their minds wrapped around the fact that the seething fury at the leadership of the Republican Party is real, and it's going to bubble over somehow with somebody, and right now it's with Trump,"" said the conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham, noting that there were ""a lot of ticked-off people out there who are willing to throw both parties into the fire.""Mr. Erickson himself got a taste of Mr. Trump's die-hard loyalists, recounting in his speech at the conference Saturday that he had received a vitriolic response to his decision to bar Mr. Trump.""We will not gain the White House,"" said Mr. Erickson about the inflammatory messages he had received, ""if we're screaming at people, calling them whores and queer and the N-word.""Even before Friday night, prominent Republican women said they were worried about how female voters would respond to Mr. Trump's prominence on the debate stage, where he defended imprecations like ""fat pigs"" and ""bimbo"" to describe women -- and his rivals did not chide him.But Mr. Trump's comment Friday night about Ms. Kelly caused a new bout of consternation among senior Republican leaders, who saw it as the latest distraction from the business of choosing a presidential candidate who can return the White House to the party in 2016.""We need to nominate somebody who can win, somebody who is substantive and somebody who knows how to govern,"" said former Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire. ""But we can't have that debate in the full jacket as long as we're sidetracked off on this Trump exercise. It does undermine our ability to have a substantive debate. All the substantive arguments are being muted by his persona.""Still, Mr. Gregg said that while RedState was wise to bar him from its event, the party would only ""make him an even larger figure"" by trying to keep him out of future debates. ""He'd love that,"" Mr. Gregg said. ""He loves when institutional forces take him on. That's part of his shtick.""He added: ""The campaign is serious, but his campaign isn't. It's entertainment. What's the line of decency in the entertainment world? It's pretty far out there.""Some in the party have mused privately about using Mr. Trump's refusal to rule out an independent bid as grounds to bar him from future debates, but there is deep concern that such a heavy-handed effort would only prod him into pursuing such a run.It also appeared unlikely that any network could be persuaded to exclude him. As Mr. Trump crowed Friday in a telephone interview, ""I'm a ratings machine.""In Atlanta, there was resignation to the likelihood that Mr. Trump would continue to draw support from voters looking to rage against the political establishment. But some of the grass-roots activists in attendance described him as a jester, not a threat.David Pettigrew, a retiree from Milledgeville, Ga., said he knew many conservatives who regretted voting for Ross Perot in 1992 out of frustration with President George Bush. (Mr. Perot's third-party candidacy is widely believed to have helped tilt the election to Bill Clinton.) But he said he doubted Mr. Trump could win over enough disgruntled Republicans to undermine the party's nominee.""Hell, if he wants to run as a third party, have at it,"" Mr. Pettigrew said.Mr. Trump, for his part, fired off a defiant salute to the RedState crowd on Twitter Saturday morning: ""I miss you all, and thanks for all of your support. Political correctness is killing our country.""He added in a word what he thought of his critics: ""weakness.""Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitterand the First Draft newsletter.",0.0
When Architecture Meets Pop Culture:   [Style Desk ],,"For a serious architect who has designed public housing in Dallas and a bridge in Slovenia, it may come as a surprise that Oana Stanescu's best-known work is a 50-foot-high volcano that Kanye West ascended onstage during his grandiose Yeezus tour.But then again, Ms. Stanescu, 32, is not your typical bespectacled architect, reaching for trophy buildings or lucrative commissions.Along with Dong-Ping Wong, her partner in the West Village architectural firm Family, Ms. Stanescu is making a name for herself in design circles for her ability to merge pop culture with utilitarian design.Her firm recently completed the Hong Kong flagship store of Off-White, a high-end streetwear brand started by Virgil Abloh, Mr. West's creative director. Ms. Stanescu is one of the designers behind the +Pool project, which is seeking to install a floating swimming pool in the East River. Other clients have included Marina Abramovic and the New Museum in New York.""Oana is a creative ticking time bomb; she never stops,"" said Carl Jackson, 41, a filmmaker who recently hired Family to design two projects in San Diego: a film studio and a sustainable housing community.Ms. Stanescu's penchant for pop culture began in Resita, an industrial town in western Romania, where she grew up watching British MTV and listening to Guns N' Roses' ""Appetite for Destruction."" They offered an escape from Romania, which was in the violent throes of a revolution and the ouster of Nicolae Ceausescu.""I have memories of hiding in the basement, sleeping on floors where there were no windows,"" she said.Ms. Stanescu studied architecture at Polytechnic University of Timisoara in western Romania. Midway through the six-year program, she landed an internship at REX in New York, formerly a branch of Rem Koolhaas's prestigious Office of Metropolitan Architecture.From there, she worked at other top architecture firms, including Sanaa in Japan, Herzog & de Meuron in Switzerland and Architecture for Humanity in South Africa, before joining Family in 2013.""At one point, my mom said, 'There aren't enough continents for you,' "" Ms. Stanescu said.She now lives in a sunny townhouse in Harlem, which she shares with friends and a dog named Perry, and teaches a graduate-level design course at Columbia University, a short walk away.Her most famous client remains Mr. West, for whom she is working on several projects, the details of which she cannot disclose. The two met when he hired the Office of Metropolitan Architecture to design a viewing pavilion for his short film ""Cruel Summer"" during the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. The association has given her a taste of tabloid scrutiny, with several media outlets, including Glamour magazine UK and Metro, inaccurately crediting her with baby-proofing Mr. West's homes.""How strange,"" she said of her brush with the gossip mill. ""Design is at its best when it's collaborative. I'm interested in pushing the boundaries of what architecture can do.""Photograph Oana Stanescu, with an Architectural Model, Likes to Push Boundaries.

SpongeBob Outguns 'Sniper' at Box Office:   [Brief ],,"After successfully returning the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to the multiplex, Paramount has pulled off the same trick with another aging cartoon crew. ""The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water"" soaked up a stellar $56 million at North American theaters over the weekend, demonstrating the power of nostalgia and the promotional strength of Nickelodeon, Paramount's corporate sibling.But the weekend also brought two big-budget bombs, with the $200 million ""Jupiter Ascending"" shaping up as yet another misfire from Andy and Lana Wachowski -- it managed only about $19 million in ticket sales -- and the $100 million fantasy ""Seventh Son"" generating a feeble $7.1 million.""The SpongeBob Movie,"" which cost about $74 million to make and benefited from light family-audience competition, was easily the No. 1 draw, dethroning ""American Sniper"" (Warner), which fell to second place after three consecutive weekends in the top spot. ""American Sniper"" took in about $24.2 million, for a new domestic total of $282.3 million, according to Rentrak, which compiles box-office data.""Jupiter Ascending,"" from Warner and Village Roadshow, arrived in third place, suffering from poor reviews and a lingering stink created by a delayed release; Warner had initially planned a July debut. The Wachowskis have now delivered three mega-duds a row, following ""Speed Racer"" and ""Cloud Atlas."" Warner said ""Jupiter Ascending"" took in an additional $32.5 million overseas over the weekend.""Seventh Son,"" delayed at least three times in its release and receiving even worse reviews, arrived in fourth place. A decent $86 million in overseas ticket sales (and counting) for ""Seventh Son"" will help cushion the blow, but Legendary Entertainment has already taken a steep write-down on the movie, which was distributed by Universal. ""Paddington"" chugged along in fifth place, taking in $5.4 million, for a four-week domestic total for the Weinstein Company of $57.3 million.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Photograph (Photograph by Paramount Pictures)",0.0
New Meningitis Strain in Africa Brings Call for More Vaccines:   [Foreign Desk ],,"Meningitis may be poised for a ferocious comeback in Africa, international aid organizations are warning, and vaccine manufacturers must step up production if the outbreak is to be averted.Meningitis is caused by one of several strains of the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. A vaccine introduced five years ago has all but defeated meningitis A infections in Africa. But infections with another strain, Type C, are on the rise.Some experts fear the new strain will explode next year, while others say too little is known to predict its course reliably.Meningitis C vaccines exist but are expensive: $20 per shot is the lowest price offered thus far to an international public health consortium, led by the World Health Organization, that stockpiles vaccines for emergencies.The consortium, the International Coordinating Group for Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control, is seeking five million doses. To be effective, they must be shipped and injected before January, when meningitis normally returns to Africa with the dry harmattan winds.Unless something drastic happens -- a surge of donor money, or huge price cuts -- the consortium's experts do not hold out much hope.""If we don't get the doses, we'll be having a really hard time,"" said Dr. William A. Perea, coordinator of the W.H.O.'s epidemic diseases control unit. ""So we are making a little noise.""The global vaccine industry is fragile. Because of mergers and acquisitions, only four major pharmaceutical companies -- GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi-Pasteur, Merck and Pfizer -- still make vaccines for diseases other than flu. They are primarily interested in serving wealthy countries, where they can charge $100 or more per dose.As a result, there are too few factories to supply the vaccines poor countries need, and also little competition to drive down prices.""Vaccine pricing has traditionally been much more secretive than drug pricing,"" said Kate Elder, vaccines policy adviser at Doctors Without Borders. ""When we survey companies, they never tell us how they arrive at prices.""State-owned factories in India, Brazil, Cuba and elsewhere also manufacture meningitis vaccines. While they can sometimes be paid to make more than their own countries need, many are reliant on old technology and hampered by government bureaucracies.A low-priced vaccine against meningitis C and four other strains of the infection is being developed in India but will need at least another five years of testing.Meningitis used to strike thousands of Africans every year. In 1997, meningitis sickened 250,000 people and killed 25,000.Survivors also suffer. A quarter are left brain-damaged, paralyzed, prone to seizures or without limbs that had to be amputated. In African schools for the deaf, most students are meningitis victims.Desperate families often sell everything to pay for care: chickens, cows, even front doors, which in West Africa can be elaborately carved heirlooms.Type A bacteria were once responsible for more than 80 percent of Africa's meningitis cases, but that infection is being vanquished by a new vaccine, MenAfriVac, which was introduced in 2010 by the W.H.O., the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and PATH, a Seattle health technology group. Over 220 million doses against Type A, made by the Serum Institute of India for 50 cents each, have been injected.But that success has had an alarming coda. Two years ago, a new Type C strain appeared, a genetic variant from the previous Type C. In April, a serious outbreak in Niger sickened nearly 6,000 people and caused nearly 500 deaths.""There was a lot of anxiety, because very few people in Niger didn't know somebody who'd gotten ill or died in the past,"" said Dr. Sarah A. Meyer, an epidemiologist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who helped fight the outbreak. ""People prayed for the rains to start. And they started rushing to the pharmacy for vaccines.""Experts are now fiercely debating what will happen when the harmattan winds return to Africa's so-called meningitis belt, which stretches from the Atlantic Coast to Ethiopia.Experts at the W.H.O. and Doctors Without Borders fear that the new strain will spread. But others, including Dr. Meyer and colleagues at the C.D.C., say there is no way to predict that with confidence. Previous outbreaks of meningitis C -- in Europe, for example -- have not followed the pattern typical of Type A in Africa: a few low-level years, then an explosive epidemic.""The idea that there is a death knell sounding for these countries is exaggerated,"" said Dr. Marc LaForce, a meningitis expert who led the development of MenAfriVac.But the new Type C strain is not identical to its European ancestor, ""so one has to prepare,"" said Dr. Olivier Ronveaux, an epidemiologist at the W.H.O.Over the next few weeks, his agency hopes to swab the throats of Africans across the belt to see how many carry the new Type C strain without symptoms. That may help predict what will happen in January.On a much smaller scale, a similar strain substitution took place on American college campuses in the last decade. Expensive new quadrivalent vaccines, effective against multiple strains of meningitis, were introduced in 2005 and reduced infections with Types A, C, W and Y by more than 90 percent.Then, in 2013, the B strain surged, causing outbreaks at Princeton and the University of California, Santa Barbara. One student died. The Obama administration responded by importing a meningitis B vaccine that had been approved in Europe but not in the United States.Meningitis often strikes young people and can progress from a bad headache to death so quickly that hospital care comes too late, even in the United States.Mysteriously, Neisseria bacteria spread easily in saliva and harmlessly colonize the throats of about a fifth of the world's population. The bacteria kill only if they reach the bloodstream or the meninges, membranes protecting the brain and spine.In the West, ""freshman meningitis"" or ""boot camp meningitis"" affects people gathered in dorms or barracks who adopt new habits like sharing beer bottles, toothbrushes, cigarettes or joints -- or kissing.In Africa, meningitis surges when cold winds force families indoors and dry out throats, opening tiny cracks through which bacteria enter the blood.The world used to rely on polysaccharide vaccines, which are cheap, but their protection does not last long, and they do not kill silent throat infections.About 20 years ago, conjugate vaccines were introduced. By coupling the polysaccharides -- sugarlike molecules from the bacterial membranes -- to proteins, they provoke long-lasting immune responses and can also clear silent infections.Six strains of the meningitis bacteria -- A, B, C, W, X and Y -- cause disease. GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi make conjugate vaccines against A, C, W and Y, and have made some of them available to the W.H.O. at lower prices. But the manufacturers cannot produce enough for a major outbreak.The Serum Institute of India is working on a vaccine against five strains -- all but B -- but it will not be finished until about 2020, Dr. LaForce said, assuming it passes all clinical trials.Vaccines against Type B bacteria must be made differently because the polysaccharides on the membrane of that strain resemble some on the surface of human nerve cells, so there is a risk that making antibodies to them could cause a dangerous autoimmune reaction.Photograph Somali Mothers Waiting in Line in Mogadishu to Have Their Babies Vaccinated Against Meningitis and Other Diseases in 2013.

Chinese Official Criticizes U.S. on Internet Security Policy:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"HONG KONG -- Just days after China and the United States hailed a high-level agreement limiting cyberattacks, a former commander of one of the Chinese military's top hacking units lashed out at American Internet policy, in a sign of how far apart Beijing and Washington remain on technology issues.In prepared remarks on Tuesday, Hao Yeli, the former deputy head of the Fourth Department of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department -- which is responsible for the Chinese military's offensive electronic warfare -- said that the United States had double standards with online surveillance and that the uncertainty behind the origin of digital attacks makes it difficult to apply traditional rules of engagement to the Internet.Ms. Hao's speech punctured some of the cautious optimism analysts had expressed about last week's agreement between the United States and China, which was intended to rein in hacking theft of intellectual property and create international standards for ""appropriate conduct in cyberspace."" Speaking at an Internet security conference in Beijing that also featured a former National Security Agency director, Keith B. Alexander, Ms. Hao challenged the position generally favored by American politicians.Referring to the Arab Spring, Ms. Hao -- now the deputy director of the China Institute for Innovation and Development Strategy -- warned that taking away developing countries' ability to control public opinion through Internet controls and surveillance would result not in more openness, but instead in ""blood"" and ""hatred,"" according to an official transcript of her speech.Though Ms. Hao ultimately called for greater communication between the world's two largest economies, she also said the United States should be less imperious in dictating how governments of other countries manage their own Internet, and in general behave online.""America spreads the ideas of democracy widely across the world, but in cyberspace, it's the opposite,"" she said. ""The United States continuously maintains a system to monitor the rest of the world but asks other countries to strictly control themselves and remain within bounds. This unsymmetrical line of thinking continues.""Ms. Hao and Mr. Alexander, whose speech largely called for cooperation between the United States and China on the shared threat of online attacks, both spoke as part of the China Internet Security Conference sponsored by the Chinese online security and search firm Qihoo 360.Likening China and the United States to strangers walking in the dark who mistake each other for ghosts, Ms. Hao said it was critical for each country to stop demonizing the other and instead begin a broader dialogue.Ms. Hao also said any new rules of engagement for online attacks would probably be different from those used in other forms of warfare.""Because of the complexities and uncertainties of cyberspace, many of the rules of engagement applied normally would be difficult to directly follow,"" she said.",0.0

A Plague of Bucks and Does:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. Last month, a stag reportedly gored a German shepherd named Sprocket, puncturing the dog's lung with an antler. Two days later, one jumped through a window at a T.J. Maxx store, then bounded bloodied up and down the aisles of clothes.At least one poacher has been convicted of killing deer and local streets have seen an increase in crashes involving them. The animals' rambunctiousness is not unusual during the fall rutting season when they get lusty and excited while seeking mates.But this activity is not occurring in an alpine enclave. It is happening on Staten Island.What began as a novelty -- a small, incongruous herd of almost-urban white-tailed deer -- has, according to environmental officials and local leaders, become a safety issue as the animals have multiplied and their behavior has begun to put more drivers in this car-centric borough at risk. The increase in the deer population has also has divided Staten Island into several factions, including those who want to feed them peanut butter and those who want them dead.That groups of deer inhabit parts of New York City is not a new development. But now, with their numbers continuing to grow and the fall mating season in full swing, the incidence of human-deer friction has escalated, as have concerns that something must be done.Next month, in a move more common to the suburbs, the city's Transportation Department plans to post deer-warning signs in parts of the borough after dozens of crashes and untold close calls.Unwilling to wait for official action, some residents, like Brian and Jean Nutley of Rockland Avenue have spent their own money on signs warning drivers to beware of deer.Though deer were once unusual on Staten Island, their numbers have soared in recent years. A tally by the State Department of Environmental Conservation counted just two dozen in 2008. Last year, an infrared aerial survey by the city's Parks Department found nearly 800 -- a figure that some say is too low.James S. Oddo, the Staten Island borough president, has been particularly vocal about the threat posed by the cervidae, as the deer family is called, out of concern about their potential to harm more than a fender.Deer graze on underbrush, Mr. Oddo said, and seem to prefer native species of plants. Left unchecked, their nibbling could denude the island's wooded areas and deliver a blow to biodiversity.Tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease are another concern, he said, though he acknowledged that there was no evidence of an increase in cases. There were 37 car crashes involving deer last year and 30 so far this year, according to the Police Department.""What once was a novelty, and fun, is now a legitimate threat to the environment,"" Mr. Oddo said, ""and to the health and well-being of people.""And dogs. On Oct. 29, a deer leapt the fence at Robert Cutrona's house in the Todt Hill neighborhood. The family believes it gored Sprocket with its antlers, piercing the 5-year-old dog's lung, according to Robert Cutrona Sr., Mr. Cutrona's father. Nobody actually saw what happened, he said, but ""the deer had been prowling around"" on previous days. The dog, which was examined by a veterinarian, is recovering. ""Everybody kind of analyzed the wound on the animal,"" the elder Mr. Cutrona said. ""They indicated it could only be a deer's antlers.""Other incidents involving deer have been confirmed. On Halloween, a stag bashed through the glass at a T.J. Maxx on Forest Avenue shortly before the store opened, Doreen Thompson, a spokeswoman for the company, said. ""Thankfully, none of our store associates were injured,"" Ms. Thompson said in a statement. The badly wounded deer was euthanized.Beyond the roughly two dozen warning signs that the Transportation Department will install where deer are known to live, other efforts are underway to control the animals. Fencing has been installed around new trees, including a $400,000 fence surrounding the former Brookfield Landfill to protect it while it is being refurbished as a park, according to city officials. The department has disseminated fliers in three languages to teach residents about living with deer. (One lesson: Don't feed them.)A deer task force was convened last year, encompassing representatives of nearly a dozen state and federal agencies that met to discuss strategies. Though the group was formed to address the issue citywide, its primary focus has been on Staten Island. At a recent meeting, park officials with experience at the Fire Island National Seashore, where deer are sometimes hand-fed by beachgoers, offered tips, according to city officials.The federal Agriculture Department is conducting its own environmental review of the effect of the deer on Staten Island, a requirement before any steps to mitigate the problem are taken. Such steps could include sterilizing deer or otherwise reducing their numbers.Some people refuse to wait. Though it is illegal to hunt in New York City, a Staten Island resident, David Oakes, was convicted in March of poaching and ordered to pay a $3,000 fine, after an investigation by environmental enforcement officers found he had shot several deer with a bow and arrow, leaving beheaded corpses behind.Mr. Oakes could not be reached for comment.Several headless deer carcasses have turned up elsewhere on Staten Island, according to a senior environmental official with knowledge of the investigation of Mr. Oakes who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, suggesting that Mr. Oakes was not the only one to take matters into his own hands.Other residents are far kinder. The official said he had come across piles of bread slices carefully spread with peanut butter left in the woods for deer who, like four-footed gourmands, lick off just the nutty spread. He also met with neighbors bereft when a favorite local buck known as Rudy in the Mount Loretto area went missing.Naomi and Howard Kastner's children delight in the deer that leap from between the trees each evening. But that was before the family almost careened into a deer and her offspring on an early drive. They drive more cautiously now, but still stop short of wanting the deer gone.""Getting rid of them? I don't see it,"" Ms. Kastner said. ""It's nature.""",0.0
World Briefing | Asia; Myanmar: Official Tally Is Announced:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BANGKOK -- Myanmar's election commission on Friday announced the final tally of the country's Nov. 8 landmark election, a rout by the opposition, led by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.Her party, the National League for Democracy, won 390 seats compared with 42 for the governing party, a state-run television station reported in its Friday evening broadcast. The remaining 59 available seats in Parliament were won by smaller parties. One-quarter of the seats were not contested and are controlled by the military.The victory gives Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's party a large majority in Parliament and the right to select a new president early next year.Both the president and the head of the military have congratulated Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi on her party's performance. But they have also given mixed signals about the timing of the transfer of power, which, according to the Constitution, must be carried out by March.

How Argentina 'Suicides' the Truth:   Commentary,,"BUENOS AIRES -- POLITICAL ""suicides"" are so common in Argentina that a special word has been invented for them.Ask different people in Buenos Aires today and they may disagree whether the crusading prosecutor Alberto Nisman was murdered or took his own life. But most everyone will concur that Mr. Nisman was ""suicided,"" the latest victim of a dark-power centrifuge that with sinister regularity spews out dead bodies in this divided nation.The historical record does not bode well for clarity in the Nisman case. Juan Duarte, older brother of Argentina's political saint, Eva Perón, committed ""suicide"" in 1953, nine months after his sister had thrown the nation into a paroxysm of grief over her own early death, at age 33, from cancer.Embroiled in corruption scandals and suspected of playing a hand in the smuggling of Nazi funds to Argentina, Mr. Duarte was found, like Mr. Nisman, alone, with a bullet in his head. To this day, historians debate the real cause of Mr. Duarte's death.The head-scratching continues over more recent mysterious deaths. Héctor Febres, an officer in charge of the so-called ""maternity ward"" at the notorious Navy Mechanics School in Buenos Aires that became a death camp for thousands of political prisoners during the 1976-83 military dictatorship, was found dead by cyanide poisoning in his cell in 2007.An apparent suicide, he was believed by many to have been murdered, to silence him about the human rights crimes for which he was on trial.The Febres case resonates today. Mr. Nisman died the day before he was to appear before Congress to substantiate his charges against President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for conspiring with Iran. And the judge who investigated Mr. Febres's death, Sandra Arroyo Salgado, was married to Mr. Nisman at the time.Ms. Arroyo Salgado reached the conclusion that Mr. Febres was killed by former comrades who feared he would speak about one of the most heinous of the junta's crimes: keeping pregnant political prisoners alive until they gave birth, then murdering them, and handing over their babies to ""good"" military families to raise as their own.A higher court overturned Judge Arroyo Salgado's attempt to prosecute the officers she suspected of Mr. Febres's death. Another unsolved ""suicide.""Sometimes, one death is not enough to cover up the corruption and criminality of Argentina's shady establishment. The invisible ""mechanics"" who silence troublesome witnesses have not balked at blowing up entire city blocks. On Nov. 3, 1995, a huge explosion rocked Río Tercero in the central province of Córdoba, killing seven people, injuring hundreds and devastating wide areas of the small city.The explosion, whose epicenter was a weapons factory, was allegedly designed to cover up missing armaments that the government had secretly sold to Ecuador and Croatia, in violation of international agreements. In 2013, former President Carlos Menem was convicted of the arms smuggling, and last December, four military officers were convicted of the explosion. (Both sentences are pending appeals.)Intimidation of court officials is routine. Only last month, Judge Claudio Bonadío, handling charges against the president regarding irregularities in a hotel business she owns, received a death threat assembled from cutout letters.""Argentina is monotonous, it repeats its tragedies,"" says Santiago Kovadloff, a 72-year-old philosopher who, in the aftermath of Mr. Nisman's death, has emerged as the country's moral compass. ""There is a long sequence of evidence that highlights the predominance of heinous crime over legality.""It was in this context of corruption's pervading every layer of political life that Mr. Nisman presented his explosive charges against the president in court on Jan. 14. The countless hours of phone intercepts on which they were based revealed a conspiratorial underworld unlike anything a prosecutor had dared reveal before.The wiretaps included a call from someone close to the president, speaking from inside the presidential palace, allegedly transmitting a secret message to Iran. Mr. Nisman claimed the president planned to shield from prosecution five Iranian suspects charged with the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that left 85 dead in 1994.In the brief four days that we now know were left to him, Mr. Nisman went on a fearless media blitz, discussing, in his trademark motormouth style, a world of government subterfuge that had never been exposed in such detail.""I know I could get killed over this,"" he said, as he gave a whirlwind tour of revelation upon revelation.The prosecutor was shining light on a corrupt system of secret influences and covert agents across the government. ""It's a structure that is repeated everywhere,"" says Mr. Kovadloff.And then, amid the shock and outrage, Mr. Nisman died. Or was ""suicided,"" to add a final ingredient of unfathomable mystery to the mix. The effect of all this on Argentina is unlike anything else in recent times. Mr. Nisman was only a prosecutor, but his death is dressed in the awed stupefaction of a Kennedy-level event.AuthorAffiliation UKI GONI Uki Goñi, a writer and journalist, is the author of ""The Real Odessa: Smuggling the Nazis to Perón's Argentina.""Illustration Drawing (Drawing by Cun Shi)",0.0
A Record With Barely a Ripple:   [Sports Desk ],,"KAZAN, Russia -- Out of the water, Katie Ledecky does little to draw attention to herself. She dresses demurely, wears her hair in a relaxed bob and is quiet in a crowd, content to leave the performing to others. When she does talk, she speaks the way she writes: succinctly, with nary a run-on sentence.The swimming pool is Ledecky's phone booth. She enters it and changes into a superhero who swoops into public consciousness a couple of times a year to single-handedly save distance swimming from disappearing off the face of the earth.The three preliminary heats of the women's 1,500-meter freestyle, Ledecky's only race of the day at the world championships, were placed at the end of Monday's morning session for a reason. By that time, most of the athletes and many of the fans had left, leaving the 15,000-seat Kazan Arena less than a quarter full. Even before the advent of the short attention span, the universal belief has been that meets can be enough of an exercise in endurance without subjecting spectators to the scene of bodies swimming facedown in the water for several minutes or more.Then along came Ledecky. In her own low-key way, she has made people stand up and take notice of her and the long races that fuel her journey of self-discovery. Singular feats of human achievement never grow mundane, and what Ledecky, 18, would produce on this sleepy morning was her eighth world record in the past two years.As Ledecky settled into her metronomic pace, the traffic in the warm-down pool, which usually flows in a steady current, clogged up as swimmers stopped or hopped out of the pool to glance at the giant video screen and check her progress.The few thousand people left in the building gradually stirred to life as the scoreboard flashed splits that showed Ledecky was under her world-record pace. The distance between Ledecky and her nearest competitor, Jessica Ashwood of Australia, stretched from two body lengths to 20 meters, then to almost 29 seconds.Roughly a dozen of Ledecky's American teammates moved down from the top of the grandstands and cajoled a taciturn security guard into letting them reposition themselves in a corner closest to the starting blocks so she could better hear their cheers.By the final lap, some Russian fans in the grandstand at the end of the pool, opposite the starting blocks, were banging their CheerStix together as if they were cymbals. In the grandstands running the length of the pool, on the side where Ledecky breathed on the even laps, stood her parents, her uncle and her brother, who was operating a video camera in his right hand and gesturing madly with his left, trying to hurry her home.Ledecky stopped the clock in 15 minutes 27.71 seconds, which was 65-hundredths of a second better than her record time in last summer's Pan Pacific Championships. She laughed when she saw the time. It was like Taylor Swift taping herself singing in the shower and having the recording become the best-selling song of all time.Ledecky's instructions from her coach, Bruce Gemmell, had been to treat the swim as a standard warm-up: Swim the first 900 meters easy, increase the effort over the next 300 meters, and swim the last 300 meters in whatever way she preferred. Ledecky thought she had done an exemplary job of following his directions, which accounted for her stunned look when she saw her time blazing on the scoreboard.In 2015, only 14 American men have gone faster over 1,500 meters. Ledecky's time would make her 96th in the men's world rankings.As she let the time settle in, Ledecky leaned across the lane line, locked eyes with Gemmell and shrugged. Athletes from every sport and of any skill level could surely read the message conveyed by her body language: Sometimes the less you consciously try, the more you conspicuously achieve.""I think the biggest takeaway is when you can relax and perform without expectations,"" Gemmell said, ""those are where the highest-level performances come.""He added, ""When you can relax and not have expectations and let yourself perform at the level you've prepared for, sometimes you get your best performances.""Ledecky, who came up maddeningly short in her world-record bid in the 400 freestyle Sunday, offered another explanation: numerology. She informed Gemmell afterward that she won the 800 freestyle at the London Olympics on Aug. 3, 2012, and set her first world record in the 800 at the 2013 world championships on Aug. 3. Monday was another Aug. 3 -- and she was in the third heat to boot.Ledecky's world record was the first of three set on the second day of the meet. In the evening session, Sarah Sjostrom of Sweden lowered her day-old mark in the 100 butterfly by a hundredth of a second, winning in 55.64 seconds. Katinka Hosszu of Hungary broke the longest-standing individual women's world record with a 2:06.12 in the 200 individual medley. She surpassed the American Ariana Kukors's 2:06.15, recorded in 2009 in a suit that has since been outlawed.The women's 1,500 final is Tuesday, and Ledecky hopes it will serve as a similarly sublime warm-up for the 200-meter freestyle semifinals that will follow roughly 20 minutes later. The 200 freestyle has a marquee field that includes the defending champion -- and Ledecky's teammate -- Missy Franklin.Franklin, who left the pool before Ledecky's race to rest for her 100-meter backstroke semifinal, was eating lunch when she heard about the record. ""Katie's so special in that some people might almost get used to breaking a world record every time they swim,"" Franklin said. ""But I feel like she really, really appreciates it, but she also doesn't do it for the world record. She's just going out there and trying to be her best, and that just happens to be a world record.""It must be a sinking feeling for Ledecky's rivals, many of whom are accustomed to setting the pace and swimming from ahead, to be falling farther and farther behind. How do they relax and be their best when they are getting lapped on a world stage? Before she was done, Ledecky had lapped the swimmers in Lanes 1, 8 and 9. The competitor in Lane 1 happened to be her teammate Katy Campbell, a U.C.L.A. standout who won the national title in the 1,500 free last summer after Ledecky scratched.Campbell, who finished 1 minute 12 seconds behind Ledecky, said, ""I mean, it's tough racing her, but you know you're racing the best, and you know that if you can get close to her, you are probably one of the best, too.""In 2004, a talented 19-year-old American entered the men's 1,500 at the Olympic trials and produced a top-eight time. He was Ryan Lochte, who has gone on to win 11 Olympic medals at much shorter distances.Asked Monday if he could remember his time, Lochte said, ""A 15:22?""It was a 15:28.37. Lochte sighed. ""Ledecky beat me,"" he said. ""Nice.""He added: ""She's one of the best distance freestylers I've ever seen. I trained with her in Colorado once, and she made me look like I was stopping. She flew by me.""Somewhere, someone is going to pay close attention whenever Ledecky races.""There's some 13-year-old out there right now,"" Lochte said, ""who looks at Katie and says: 'I can do that. I can beat her.' They're full of energy and naïve enough and full of hope and everything else, and it'll happen.""Photograph Top, Katie Ledecky, 18, On Her Way to Setting a World Record Monday at the World Championships.

Sun Besieges an Iraq With Few Ways to Fight Back:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BAGHDAD -- At noon, the light bouncing off the hot concrete seems to bleach everything, like an overexposed photograph. Standing for more than a minute in the sun sets off a full-body sweat.Even after sunset, as the temperature coasts down from 122 degrees Fahrenheit, or 50 degrees Celsius, to perhaps 108, Baghdad's heat can seem like a living thing. It clings to every contour of the body, squeezing tight.Iraq has been hot even by its own standards. Taking all conditions into account, the Weather Channel calculated that the peak day in Baghdad this summer felt like 159 degrees. It was a data point most likely of little use to outsiders unable to imagine even 122 degrees, and of little comfort to Iraqis living in it.They have taken to the streets all around the country, protesting in central squares and blaming government corruption for the chronic electricity shortages that shut down air coolers and fans all but a few hours a day. In Samawa, south of Baghdad, protesters surrounded the governor's house on Sunday evening and demanded that he resign.Perhaps recalling that Iraqis have overthrown two governments in midsummer, in 1958 and 1968, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has warned that without quick fixes, the government will face ""revolutionary sentiments.""But any insurrectionary impulse must overcome a competing instinct to surrender to the heat. Iraqis refer to this month as ""blazing August"" -- it rhymes in Arabic, ""ab al-lahab"" -- and they spend it doing as little as possible. Much of what they do do is find ways to cool down.On and around Rasheed Street in central Baghdad on Saturday afternoon, the few who ventured out on foot stuck to shaded sidewalks under the pillared arcades of weathered Ottoman buildings.People darted onto the white-hot street only to dodge obstacles, like a stuck donkey cart, a line of shoppers waiting to buy four-foot-long blocks of ice, or a fully clothed man taking a shower.The shower head, sprinkling lukewarm water that felt practically icy in the baking shade, was rigged up outside a cellphone shop belonging to Ziad Abdelhalim. He had set it up as an act of charity, but also as a lure for customers, not unlike frigidly air-conditioned New York City shops that leave their doors open to waft enticingly cool gusts onto the sidewalk.""Clients pass by just to use it,"" said Mr. Abdelhalim, 42, wet from dunking his own head in the stream. He said it was especially popular during Ramadan, which fell in June and July this year. The holy month's daily fast prohibits the observant from drinking water all day, but not from splashing in it.""We have two rivers -- lots of water,"" he said, gesturing toward the Tigris, a couple of blocks away, and the Euphrates farther west.In fact, the rivers that made Mesopotamia the cradle of civilization are threatened by drought and upstream water disputes. Yet water bills are so low that the cost is negligible for Iraqis, who in times like these often resort to taking three or four showers a day.That is, if they are lucky. If their pipes and water tanks are in the sun, then their tap water is, as one Iraqi put it, ""a mixture of hot and boiling hot.""Not far from Mr. Abdelhalim's shower, there was a solution. A merchant took industrial-size rods of ice from a freezer and sawed them to order. Some customers planned to put them in their water tanks to make showers bearable. Others said they would use the ice for drinks, or simply sit around a big block of it, the way they huddle in winter by kerosene heaters.A few doors down, water spattered on the sidewalk. A little girl in a pink tank top, shorts and glittering gold sandals was pouring it from a tin cup onto her chest. Then she slumped lazily against her father, Haytham Qahtan.He sat at a small wooden table outside a food shop and stroked her arm, which glistened with sweat. On offer was traditional food that Iraqis eat even in summer: boiled sheep's heads on enormous platters of rice, with hot tea.Mr. Qahtan, 36, makes a living driving a motorized rickshaw, its open cab only partly shaded. Recently, he said, he got stuck in a traffic jam, boiling in the sun, only to have his vehicle break down. He ended up having to pay a traffic ticket worth more than his day's wages.The money is critical. He pays $100 a month for generator power when the state grid is down, which lately is all but five or six hours a day.Not all Iraqis can treat themselves to a generator, and most of those, like Mr. Qahtan, can afford enough electricity to sustain only one simple fan or air cooler, which cools through the evaporation of water. Real air-conditioning is out of the question. And because Mr. Qahtan has only a small apartment, not a house, his family cannot resort to the centuries-old Iraqi summertime habit of sleeping on the roof.After weeks of this, he said, he is on edge, chain-smoking and drinking tea to stay calm. Every day, he joked, he drinks 32 cups. But he still finds himself getting enraged at his family for small things -- like the day before, when his daughter, Malak, 6, flipped on one too many switches for the generator to handle. The power went out, the repairman had to be called, and Mr. Qahtan blew up.""I lost my mind,"" he said.The heat, of course, is not new to Iraqis. In the Iraqi novel ""The Palm Tree and the Neighbors,"" one character declares that his countrymen have no fear of hell because ""we are so used to it.""What is relatively new is the modernization and war that in a couple of generations have turned a city of low houses and brick-walled gardens into an expanse of concrete-block apartments and concrete blast walls, requiring artificial cooling from an unreliable electrical grid.Overhead on Rasheed Street, spider webs of spaghetti-like wires testified to decades of electrical improvisation. Long rickety from years of sanctions and mismanagement, the power grid was gutted after the United States invaded in 2003 and failed to prevent the looting of infrastructure. Insurgent attacks, which have not stopped since, continue to do damage.""The invasion took Iraq back 20 or 30 years,"" Mr. Abdelhalim said, adding that the current government was little better than American occupation.""This government will not be moved by protests,"" he said. ""Only by force.""Photograph The Ruins of an Old Building Served As a Platform for Children to Jump Into the Tigris River in Baghdad and Cool Off Last Month.

Court Says Governor's Vetoes Came Too Late,,"Dozens of bills opposed by Gov. Paul LePage have become law because he misinterpreted the Maine Constitution and did not veto them in time, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court said Thursday. The court unanimously sided with legislative leaders in their fierce dispute with the Republican governor, saying that lawmakers' temporary adjournment in June did not prevent him from returning the vetoed bills to the chambers. Mr. LePage had argued that the Legislature's adjournment meant that the usual 10-day limit he is given to sign or veto bills did not apply. After the decision, he said he was thankful the justices resolved the issue and looks forward to moving on. Lawmakers hailed the ruling and called on Mr. LePage to enforce the laws, which include one that he vehemently opposed that would allow immigrants seeking asylum in Maine to receive municipal welfare benefits. There likely was not enough support in the Legislature to overturn that veto and the measure likely would have died if the governor had vetoed it on time. Mr. LePage went to the court last month after lawmakers refused to take up the 65 veto messages that his staff members hand-delivered to lawmakers on their final day of session for the year. Other measures that are now law include a measure that would expand access to an anti-overdose antidote and one that would provide insurance coverage for reproductive services for more women.",0.0

Secret Service Deputy Demoted as Panel Chairman Presses for Firing:   [National Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- Senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security on Monday demoted the deputy director of the Secret Service, amid criticism from the agency's most ardent critic on Capitol Hill.Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, who is the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, had said the deputy director, A. T. Smith, should be dismissed. Mr. Chaffetz said Mr. Smith had been part of the agency's string of mishaps and scandals.Last week, Mr. Chaffetz announced that Mr. Smith and the agency's interim director, Joseph P. Clancy, had been summoned to testify together at a hearing before the committee.It was made clear to officials at the Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security that Mr. Chaffetz did not plan to go lightly on Mr. Smith. Among other episodes, Mr. Chaffetz was likely to question Mr. Smith about his decision in 2011 to have Secret Service agents conduct welfare checks for five days on an agency employee who said she was threatened by neighbors.It was not clear how Mr. Chaffetz intended to treat Mr. Clancy, although Mr. Chaffetz has said the agency's next director should not come from within the agency -- a blow to Mr. Clancy's candidacy for the job.Shortly after the Secret Service announced that Mr. Smith had stepped down and taken a job at the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Chaffetz and the committee's ranking Democratic member, Elijah E.

Case Against a South African Opposition Leader Is Dismissed:   [Foreign Desk ],,"JOHANNESBURG -- A South African court dismissed a long-running corruption case against the opposition leader Julius Malema on Tuesday, handing a victory to one of President Jacob G. Zuma's most strident critics.The High Court in Polokwane, in Mr. Malema's home province of Limpopo, threw out the charges because of excessive delays in trying the case, which began three years ago. State prosecutors asked on Monday for another postponement because a co-defendant was ill.""Starting from 2012 up to 2015 is too long a time for any person to have a sword hanging over his head, and I'm not willing to subject the accused to that particular ordeal once more,"" Judge George Mothle said in dismissing the case.State prosecutors could still decide to refile charges, which relate to a $4.1 million road construction contract awarded to a company with ties to Mr. Malema, the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters, the country's second-largest opposition party. Members of the group, who dress in red berets and jackets, aggressively attack Mr. Zuma and the governing African National Congress in Parliament.The court did not acquit Mr. Malema, nor did it delve into the details of the charges that he improperly profited from the contract. Critics have said the case was politically motivated.The decision on Tuesday was an embarrassment for Mr. Zuma and the governing party, which have been locked in a political duel with Mr. Malema for years. Mr. Malema, a charismatic leader, was once the head of the A.N.C.'s youth wing and a strong backer of Mr. Zuma, but he was given to provocative actions like publicly singing a song called ""Shoot the Boer"" that a South African court banned as hate speech.He was expelled from the A.N.C. in 2012, and he resurrected his political career the following year by forming his new party, which calls for the nationalization of land and draws strong support from South Africa's impoverished and disaffected youth.Outside the courthouse, Mr. Malema told reporters that prosecutors ""want postponement after postponement, so that I become a citizen in South Africa with a permanent dark cloud over my head.""Mr. Malema said that he was looking forward to appearing in Parliament later this week. He has been among the most tenacious and vocal critics of Mr. Zuma's spending practices, including tens of millions of dollars of public money spent on improvements to his private homestead, Nkandla. Mr. Zuma has rejected calls by the public and the country's public protector for him to repay some of the money.""On Thursday, I will be in Parliament,"" Mr. Malema said. ""Zuma will know us better because we are free.""Mr. Malema, who has described himself as the voice of the poor, has long been dogged by questions about his lavish lifestyle, including expensive houses, cars and clothing. He has defended his ostentation by saying that he cannot inspire the poor by living in a shack.In the national elections last year, Mr. Malema's party won just over 6 percent of the vote, placing a distant third behind the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, which won 22 percent, and the A.N.C., with 62 percent.But because of Mr. Malema's high profile, his party has outsize influence in South African political discourse, and that influence may increase with Tuesday's ruling.""Politically, this is good for Malema and the E.F.F. because it does reinforce the perception that our prosecuting authorities did not go to court with a watertight case, but did so in support of a political agenda,"" said Aubrey Matshiqi, a political analyst at the Helen Suzman Foundation, a private pro-democracy group in South Africa. ""It would have been deeply satisfying for the president, I assume, to see Malema in a yellow or orange uniform.""Mr. Matshiqi said that Mr. Malema would now ""become even more bullish"" in trying to paint Mr. Zuma as personally corrupt and the A.N.C. as a corrupt party unmoored from its past as a defender of the black masses. That perception, already widespread in South Africa, could hurt the A.N.C. in municipal elections next year, he said.With the governing party's popularity already declining in recent elections, Mr. Matshiqi said, ""Malema's actions from this point onward may deepen that image crisis for the A.N.C.""Photograph Julius Malema Arriving in Court in Polokwane, South Africa, On Monday.

Kenyan Runners Accuse Officials of Stealing From Sponsorship Deal:   [Foreign Desk ],,"NAIROBI, Kenya -- Kenya's corruption is now so bad that it has sucked in some of the country's greatest heroes: its fleet-footed runners.On Monday, dozens of world-class athletes stormed the headquarters of the national athletics association here, accusing top officials of stealing money from a Nike deal and demanding that they resign.""These guys have eaten so much,"" said Julius Ndegwa, a spokesman for the runners, using the Kenyan term ""to eat"" to refer to official stealing. ""Enough is enough.""Mr. Ndegwa said that more than 70 runners were planning to spend the night in front of the offices to make sure the officials could not get inside. He called on well-wishers to bring food, water and blankets so they could extend their siege.The International Association of Athletics Federations announced this month that its ethics commission was looking into allegations that officials from Athletics Kenya, Kenya's governing body for athletics, skimmed nearly $700,000 from a multimillion-dollar sponsorship deal with Nike.Kenyan detectives are also investigating the allegations. The officials have denied them, and on Monday, David Okeyo, the association's vice president, who has been accused of stealing money from the Nike deal, did not return several phone calls and text messages.""We are cooperating with the local authorities in their investigation,"" Nike said in a statement. ""Nike conducts business with integrity and expects that our partners do the same.""Kenya is in the midst of an outburst of corruption revelations. Almost every week it is something else, something big, something the public cannot believe.A few weeks ago, a parliamentary committee was given a document that was intended to explain what happened to several million dollars that went missing from one ministry. On that document, officials said they spent $85 for simple ballpoint pens -- $85 each, that is.Soon after, a new report by a Kenyan watchdog group was released, accusing Kenyan generals of running a smuggling ring in neighboring Somalia, where the army is supposed to be battling Islamist militants. The fight against the militants along the Kenyan border has more or less stalled; according to the report, Kenyan generals have made millions smuggling sugar.Now this. Year after year, Kenya's runners are considered some of the best in the world. The man and woman who won this year's New York City Marathon were both Kenyan. In a society rived by political and ethnic rivalries, the runners' success is a source of great national pride.But many of Kenya's best athletes remain poor, and not so long ago some carried around their prize winnings in cash in their backpacks months after they won because they did not feel comfortable putting the money in a bank. Many of the runners, despite being famous, continue to live in marginalized parts of Kenya.On Monday, the runners hoisted signs that reflected the broad anger toward corruption shared by many Kenyans.""Enough is Enough for Blood Sucers,"" said one, its spelling showing the limited education some of the runners have received.""Your time is over,"" said another.",0.0
Widow of a Former South Korean President Pays a Visit to the North:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- The 92-year-old widow of Kim Dae-jung, the South Korean president who championed political reconciliation with North Korea, arrived in Pyongyang, the North's capital, on Wednesday amid cautious hopes that her trip might help thaw relations between the two countries.Lee Hee-ho, the former first lady, was not carrying any official proposal on behalf of the South Korean government, and her delegation did not include a current government official from Seoul. The publicized itinerary of her four-day trip included visits to a children's hospital, orphanage and maternity clinic but no formal meetings with senior North Korean officials.But given her status, analysts monitoring her trip wondered whether the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, would meet her or even send a message to the South through her. Initially, the North's official Korean Central News Agency reported only her arrival in Pyongyang.Ms. Lee's delegation took a chartered plane that made a rare trip across the border of the two Koreas, along the Korean Peninsula's western coast.During his presidency, Kim Dae-jung, a respected figure among liberal South Koreans who generally supported engagement with the North, flew to Pyongyang in 2000 and hugged the current leader's father, Kim Jong-il, in the first inter-Korean summit meeting. He was awarded that year's Nobel Peace Prize for bringing a rapprochement to the divided peninsula.His ""Sunshine Policy,"" which included generous aid shipments for the North and a flurry of inter-Korean projects, like tearful reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War, continued through the administration of his liberal successor, Roh Moo-hyun. Mr. Roh met Kim Jong-il for a second summit meeting in 2007.The policy crumbled when South Koreans voted for conservative leadership that began with the inauguration of President Lee Myung-bak in 2008 and has continued under the incumbent president, Park Geun-hye. Both Mr. Lee and Ms. Park criticized the ""Sunshine Policy"" as coddling the North and allowing its nuclear weapons program to proceed.North Korea retreated into belligerent isolation, cutting off humanitarian exchanges with the South and conducting nuclear and long-range missile tests, as well as shelling a South Korean island in 2010. Efforts to improve relations since then have made little progress, as the mutual mistrust has remained deep.Ms. Lee ""hopes that her visit opens the way for more dialogues, exchanges and cooperation,"" Kim Sung-jae, a former South Korean culture minister who is part of her delegation, told reporters in Seoul before boarding the flight to Pyongyang on Wednesday.",0.0
Uncertain Journeys:   [Op-Ed ],,"AFTER the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, our resolve to help refugees should be stronger than ever. As we express our anger and grief, we must remember that they are fleeing precisely the type of violence that France experienced that night. Rather than turning them away, the United States and Europe need to fully commit to managing their safe passage, screening and settlement, and not leave it up to the ragtag teams of volunteers who have so far been stepping in where governments and agencies have failed.I recently spent three weeks photographing the refugee crisis in Greece, the Balkans and Germany, on assignment for Unicef. On the rocky shores of the Greek island of Lesbos, people scrambled out of their boats, welcomed by an ad hoc group of dedicated and passionate volunteers. Almost 700,000 refugees have arrived in the country this year after making the dangerous passage by sea from Turkey.Governments and NGOs generally have sophisticated systems in place to manage the flow of people in emergency situations in developing countries. But I came across only occasional interventions by organized agencies.The volunteers, many on vacation from throughout Europe and the United States, were filling the gaps. Some of them had medical training; a group of Spanish lifeguards patrolled the coast, diving into the frigid waters to rescue people; some handed out sandwiches they were making all day; and others distributed warm, dry clothes collected from towns and suburbs back home.""Welcome to Europe!"" they called out, hugging relieved refugees. There were many tears. Children, then parents, were wrapped in metallic space blankets. They were given medical assistance and provided with information about the next steps in their passage.Their welcome is some of the only warmth in a cold and arduous journey. Men, women, children, the disabled, the elderly -- no matter -- they're all packed one on top of the other into crowded train cars; screamed at in foreign languages; marched to buses by platoons of cops in full riot gear; kept in lines or clear of border fences by police officers using tear gas and batons; forced to wait for days at a time in filthy, backed-up transit centers; and generally treated like undesirables, or worse, like criminals.I expected the scenes of grief, trauma and desperation. I was surprised to find the many moments of relief, even joy, as the refugees built bonds and passed through hardship together. It is crucial that we bear witness to all of these aspects of the story.I believe, as members of the public, we need to act as the watchdogs of governments and local authorities. We have to demand that policy makers provide systematic humanitarian assistance and not leave it solely up to volunteers to do the work.We should be pressuring governments to treat the refugees as members of their own families. And everybody could be donating clothes, money or even our vacation time to receive them where they arrive.We should not let that terrible night in Paris diminish our sense of humanity and responsibility. Let's remember that the society that we are so protective of is built on the will of refugees -- our own families and the families making the frightening journey today -- with the hope of providing a better life for our children.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.AuthorAffiliation ASHLEY GILBERTSON Ashley Gilbertson is an Australian photographer and director living in New York City.

Searching For Richard Nixon:   Commentary,,"IT'S a truth universally accepted that every Republican who runs for president wants to be Ronald Reagan, and that every Democrat wants to be either Franklin Roosevelt or (God help us) John F. Kennedy.It's also a truth universally accepted that nobody ever, ever wants to be Richard Nixon.But there are times, and this might be one of them, when the country needs a little Nixon. The country and maybe especially the Republican Party, which has been trying to forget its debt to Tricky Dick ever since the helicopter carried him away.I don't mean that what we need now is a resentful paranoiac who makes enemies lists, imposes price controls, bombs countries illegally and resigns after covering up his henchmen's third-rate burglary. And if we did -- well, except for the eventual resignation (""only losers resign""), that much Donald Trump can probably deliver.Rather, it's the gifts that made Nixon successful before his flaws caught up with him that seem well-suited to the current moment.First, Nixon knew how to channel an angry, ""who's looking out for me?"" populism without letting himself be imprisoned by its excesses. A similar anger has propelled Trump, but as David Frum has pointed out, for all of the Donald's ""silent majority"" call-outs he's clearly more a George Wallace than a Nixon. Some of the anxieties he's exploited are legitimate, just as the crime wave that Wallace fixated on really was a clear and pressing problem. But like Wallace, Trump is a provocateur and bigot -- or a provocateur playing a bigot -- with a deserved ceiling on his support.The problem for Republicans is that they haven't found a candidate who can appeal to Trump's politically-disaffected supporters -- whether they're worried about immigration, jobs, terrorism or an overreaching social liberalism -- without trafficking in slurs and empty bluster. But that's roughly what Nixon did in 1968 and 1972, when he addressed (liberal historians would say exploited, but we can have that debate another time) widespread anxieties over social change and disorder without ever repudiating racial equality or civil rights.In this year's Republican primary, the non-Trump candidates have struggled mightily to make that kind of nuanced case. And they've struggled, in part, because they lack a second Nixonian gift: An instinct for the non-ideological character of many American voters, primary voters included.Nixon was a conservative and an opportunist in equal measure: leftward of Barry Goldwater, rightward of Nelson Rockefeller, and basically wherever the voters he was courting needed him to be. Whereas today's Republican politicians are used to campaigning on a list of Reaganite commandments, and often seem baffled when the conversation leaves their comfort zone.As it clearly has, again thanks in part to Trump, at various points throughout this campaign -- and that's just in a primary! In the general election and in a hypothetical administration, the Republican nominee will be confronting a political landscape calculated to frustrate any sweeping ideological design.On the one hand, we have groaning entitlement programs (Obamacare now included) in desperate need of some reform; on the other, we have a stagnant economy and a hard-pressed electorate that fears any fraying of the safety net. No president can deal with that combination without a Nixonian level of ideological flexibility -- which is to say, more than President Obama has shown, and more than the demands of Republican orthodoxy allow.Then on foreign policy, too, a dose of Nixon's cold-eyed view of world affairs would dramatically improve what Republicans are currently promising. Obama's foreign policy is, put charitably, a stumbling mess. But the Republican pretense that all we need to do is name our enemies and crush them misses the deep complexity of America's challenges.We don't face a single Soviet-style threat or a convenient ""axis"" of allied evils. We can't defeat ISIS and contain Iran and push back Russia and restrain China all at once. So we need a president who can see the strategic chessboard whole, who can instill fear in our rivals but also negotiate boldly in situations where opportunity presents itself. And that sounds much closer to Nixonian realpolitik than it does to the full-spectrum hawkishness most Republicans are running on.The odd truth is that the most Nixon-like candidate in 2016 -- in the sense of being ideologically protean and personally ruthless, at least -- might be the one waiting for Republicans in the fall.But the unfortunate reality for the country is that Hillary Clinton might offer Nixon's weaknesses without his strengths: All the seaminess and paranoia, but none of the actual achievements. (Neither the Russian ""reset"" not the Libya victory-turned-fiasco was exactly the equivalent of the opening to China.)Which makes her vulnerable. But only if her Republican rivals realize that there's a better way to be Nixonian, and that in 2016, it might be the winning way as well.I invite you to follow me on Twitter at twitter.com/DouthatNYT.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",0.0
"Seymour Lipkin, 88, Pianist and Conductor:   [Obituary (Obit); Biography ]",,"Seymour Lipkin, a pianist and conductor widely admired in both roles for his acute, deliberately unflashy musicianship, died on Nov. 16 in Blue Hill, Me. He was 88.His wife, Ellen Werner, confirmed his death.Mr. Lipkin came to wide public attention in 1948 when, at 20, he won first prize in the Rachmaninoff Fund Piano Contest, a nationwide competition held in New York. He went on to play on the world's foremost recital stages and with the world's most eminent orchestras.He interrupted that career for a life of conducting in the 1970s and '80s, returning to the piano in the '90s for a critically acclaimed second act. He was also a longtime faculty member of the Juilliard School in New York and the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.As both pianist and conductor, reviewers agreed, Mr. Lipkin made music with a conspicuous absence of the dazzle, bathos and schmaltz that are the stock in trade of many instrumentalists.""There is no blurring in Lipkin's approach,"" The Boston Globe wrote in 1996, reviewing a Beethoven recital. ""The pianist plays with the structural clarity of an architect's drawing; the drama comes from the interplay of musical ideas, not from emotional displays.""Throughout his work, Mr. Lipkin was praised by critics for his keen sensitivity -- a ""moral responsibility,"" he called it -- to the composer's intent; his sculptural finesse in shaping a musical line; and his vast knowledge of the musical literature. He was often described as a Beethoven specialist, but his pianistic compass ranged from the Baroque era to the present day.Underpinning Mr. Lipkin's music-making was his intense sense of communion with the works he performed. That communion was often rooted in deeply personal dialogues he held with the composers -- exchanges that required only Mr. Lipkin to be present.In an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2012, he recounted one especially productive conversation:",0.0

Conventional Wisdom Clashes With Data on Health Care Savings:   [National Desk ],,"In 2014, an estimated nine million people became newly insured thanks to Obamacare.There's an oft-expressed view that getting all those people covered could actually save the health system money. The argument goes something like this: Once people have insurance, they'll go to the doctor instead of an expensive emergency room. Or: Prevention costs far less than a serious illness down the road.In selling the Affordable Care Act, President Obama was fond of making these sorts of arguments. ""There's no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse,"" he said, in his big 2009 address to Congress, urging passage of the bill. ""That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives."" The White House was careful to describe the overall financial forecast for the law -- the administration said the law would slow spending growth and not reverse it. But it has also argued forcefully and repeatedly about the financial value of preventive care.This argument for the cost savings from universal health coverage makes some intuitive sense, but it's wrong. There's strong evidence from a variety of sources that people who have health insurance spend more on medical care than people who don't. It also turns out that almost all preventive health care costs more than it saves. Those facts don't mean that giving people health insurance is a waste of money, since those dollars spent may improve their health and financial security. But there are only a few situations in which giving someone more health care will actually end up saving money.Last week, the government actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services published their annual report on what it expects the nation to spend on health care over the next 10 years. Because of a long time lag in data collection, the actuaries still don't have hard numbers on health spending in 2014, when millions of people first got insurance.But, based on available information, the actuaries estimated that health spending that year jumped by 5.5 percent, a bigger rise than the country had experienced in five years. That's actually not a huge increase by historical standards -- average increases in health spending for the 30 years before the recent Great Recession were 9 percent a year. But it still marks the end of an era of record-low spending growth in the system. The slowdown seems to be over.The actuaries cited three main reasons they think health spending is set to tick up. One is the aging of the population; people tend to get sicker as they age. Another is the improving economy, which will enable more people to afford medical care -- or the time off from work it might take to attend to their health needs. But the third, and a big one, was Obamacare's coverage expansion.There's evidence about the link between insurance status and health spending from many sources. A famous randomized study of health insurance, started in the 1970s by the RAND Corporation, was designed to answer this exact question. It found that the less expensive you made it for people to obtain medical care, the more of it they used. That follows the pattern for nearly every other good in the economy, including food, clothing and electronics. The cheaper they are for people, the more they are likely to buy.That finding was echoed recently by researchers who conducted another randomized controlled trial -- this one of uninsured low-income people in Oregon. Low-income Oregonians who wanted to sign up for the state's Medicaid program were placed in a lottery. Only some got the insurance, but the researchers tracked both groups. In the first year, they found that the lottery entrants who were given Medicaid spent more on health care than those who remained uninsured.Amy Finkelstein, a professor of economics at M.I.T. and one of the authors of the Oregon study, described this finding as their least surprising result. ""There's overwhelming evidence from our study and others that when you cover people with health insurance, they use more health care,"" she said.But what about prevention? In certain situations, early spending on someone's health will stop an expensive disease in its tracks, reducing future spending. Giving people health insurance often enables them to get just this sort of preventive care -- and Obamacare requires insurers to offer most preventive services without charging any co-payments. You might expect health spending to jump initially, then slow in future years as people benefit from new prevention. But research shows that even preventive care rarely ends up saving money.Here's why: For the individual patient whose heart attack is prevented by a cholesterol screening, to give one example, that blood test is a cost-saver. But to prevent one heart attack, the health care system has to test hundreds of healthy people -- and give about a hundred of them cholesterol-lowering drugs for at least five years. Added together, those prevention measures cost more than is saved on the one heart attack treatment. (My colleagues Aaron E. Carroll and Austin Frakt have written a helpful article on this concept, known in medicine as the ""number needed to treat."")Joshua T. Cohen, the deputy director of the Center for Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at Tufts Medical Center, said: ""We've all heard it before: 'An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.' It doesn't really play out when you analyze the numbers, and the reason for that is that you have to give a lot of people those ounces of prevention to end up with one person who's going to get that pound of cure.""There's also the unavoidable fact that every time you prevent people from dying from one disease, they are likely to live longer and incur future medical expenses. The patient who benefits from the cholesterol screening may go on to develop cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's or some other costly illness.There are some prevention measures that actually do seem to save money. Counseling on contraception is one because the costs of prenatal care, delivery and pediatric care associated with an unplanned pregnancy are so substantial. But a lot of the preventive health measures that we tend to value a lot -- mammography, screening for diabetes -- tend to cost more than they save. Researchers like Mr. Cohen, who study these trade-offs, say we need to think more broadly about the value of what our preventive spending buys, not the narrow question of whether it saves money.That may be one way of thinking about the law's benefits for the newly insured, who had limited access to the health care system. For many, their new coverage means they can get free checkups and preventive disease screenings, and can more easily pay for big health care needs, like prescription drugs and operations. Early evidence suggests they are facing less financial stress as a result of their coverage.Some are now managing chronic and potentially life-threatening health conditions. But those benefits don't mean we should be surprised by the actuaries' recent findings on spending growth. More people in the health care system means more dollars spent on health care. The increase doesn't mean that Obamacare is leading to runaway costs, or that it's failing to reform the health care system to make it more efficient. But it does mean that we can't think of the coverage expansion as free.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter.

Vatican Starts Trial in Leaks to Journalists:   [Foreign Desk ],,"VATICAN CITY -- Five people, including two Italian journalists, went on trial in a Vatican courtroom on Tuesday on charges of illegally procuring and circulating confidential documents that were used to write two tell-all books detailing suspected mismanagement and corruption at the Vatican.The Vatican claims that by taking the documents, the defendants violated the ""fundamental interests of the Holy See and the State,"" language it used in a formal indictment issued on Saturday. The two journalists counter that the Vatican is violating their right to freedom of the press.""We are not martyrs, we are investigative journalists, and some principles must be defended,"" one of the defendants, Gianluigi Nuzzi, the author of ""Merchants in the Temple,"" told the small pool of reporters allowed into the Vatican courtroom on Tuesday. ""We just did our job.""The defendants face up to eight years in prison.""Journalists should be allowed to carry out their role as watchdog and investigate alleged wrongdoing without fear of repercussions,"" Nina Ognianova, Europe and Central Asia Coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said in a statement on Monday.The two books were published this month. They offer detailed evidence of mismanagement, greed and financial irregularities in the Vatican and chronicle the difficulties that Pope Francis has faced in trying to push through reforms to remedy the problems.Three other three defendants -- Francesca Chaouqui, a public-relations consultant; Msgr. Lucio Ángel Vallejo Balda; and Monsignor Vallejo Balda's assistant, Nicola Maio -- were members of a now-defunct commission set up by Pope Francis to help draft changes for the Vatican's financial dealings. Vatican prosecutors say that the three of them provided some of the documents and information that ended up in the two books.All five defendants were in court on Tuesday.As the proceedings began, Mr. Fittipaldi read a statement to the four-judge court, formally challenging its right to put him on trial. He pointed out that in Italy, the right to publish news -- as long as it is truthful and not defamatory -- is guaranteed by the Constitution as well as the European Convention on Human Rights.Lawyers for the defendants said that with the formal indictment filed only on Saturday, they did not have sufficient time to prepare for the case.Roberto Zannotti, an assistant prosecutor for the Vatican, countered that the court was not challenging freedom of the press, but rather how the information was obtained.After deliberating for 45 minutes, the judges rejected Mr. Fittipaldi's motion to dismiss the charges against him, and adjourned the court until Monday.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"A Maryland Town Fires Its Black P olice Chief, Exposing a Racial Rift:   [National Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDED. POCOMOKE CITY, Md. -- Kelvin Sewell figured he had landed his dream job in 2010, when he retired as a Baltimore police officer to help run the tiny 16-member force in this little riverfront city, which calls itself ""the friendliest town on the Eastern Shore."" A year later he became its first African-American police chief.Blacks and whites have coexisted, sometimes uneasily, in Pocomoke for centuries, but Chief Sewell, with his easygoing manner, quickly fit in. He prodded officers to patrol on foot, pleasing business owners. He helped poor students fill out college applications. Crime, everyone agrees, went down on his watch.But the chief's abrupt dismissal in June, without explanation, by a white mayor and majority white City Council that voted along racial lines, has torn Pocomoke asunder, wrecking old friendships and exposing a deep racial rift in this community of roughly 4,100 people, split almost evenly between black and white.The drama in Pocomoke is a tiny slice of America's searing national conversation about race, playing out largely in big cities like Baltimore, St. Louis and most recently, Cincinnati, around police mistreatment of African-Americans. A recent New York Times/CBS News Poll found nearly six in 10 Americans, including majorities of blacks and whites, think race relations are generally bad, and nearly four in 10 think they are getting worse.What makes Pocomoke unusual is the way that conversation is tearing apart a small town, forcing lifelong friends and neighbors to confront how differently they see the world. A black minister who went to high school with the white mayor -- and worked to elect him -- is pushing for his ouster. A white city councilman provoked gasps by addressing black citizens as ""you people.""""There is so much history here, with everybody being raised here -- except the chief,"" said Monna VanEss, 53, the former city finance director, who is white. ""A lot of these people on both sides went to school together and have known each other all their lives. We've never been this divided.""Mr. Sewell, 53, says his firing was ""racially motivated"" punishment for standing up for two black officers who experienced harassment. (Before his dismissal, his lawyer said, he had also filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that he was paid less than his white predecessor.) Black residents, led by two prominent African-American ministers, have demanded the chief's reinstatement -- they say they have more than 500 signatures on a petition -- and the resignation of Mayor Bruce Morrison.Blacks are also organizing politically, accusing the city -- with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland -- of voting rights irregularities involving the cancellation of a municipal election, which cleared the way for a white city councilman to take office in April with no opposition in a majority black district. The situation is so tense that the Justice Department recently sent mediators to hear black residents' concerns.""This is political and racial,"" said the Rev. James Jones, an associate pastor at the New Macedonia Baptist Church and the mayor's former classmate. He says African-Americans were so furious about the chief's firing he feared Pocomoke would break out into a riot. ""The political structure of Pocomoke, they are not ready for a black chief. They don't like us at the top.""Not so, insists Mayor Morrison, who said the chief's dismissal is a personnel matter, which he cannot discuss. He has no intention of quitting. ""I've never been called a racist in my life,"" he said during a brief interview at his desk in Pocomoke's small, brick City Hall. ""And I don't appreciate it.""While some whites are withholding judgment, at least one, Michael Dean, a funeral director and part-time forensic investigator with the state medical examiner's office, has openly criticized the chief. He said he has ""lost respect"" for Mr. Sewell but would not say why. Others seem unable to fathom that race may have played a role.""Nobody knows why he was let go, but there was a reason and it wasn't racial,"" said Marc Scher, who owns a bridal shop downtown. Mr. Scher says the wife of the Rev. Ronnie White, the other black minister pressing for the ouster of the mayor, does seamstress work for him, and the pastor's grandmother was the Scher family's housekeeper when Mr. Scher was a boy.""They're still my friends,"" he said. ""I don't agree with them.""Nestled between the Chesapeake and Chincoteague Bays, and surrounded by corn and soybean fields, Pocomoke City is part of Maryland's lower Eastern Shore, a world away and much poorer than fancy shore communities like St. Michaels, where prominent Washingtonians keep summer homes. Its history of racial tensions runs deep.Resistance to slavery was strong in Maryland, but the lower Eastern Shore, just across the border from Virginia, was home to Confederate sympathizers during the Civil War. The early 20th century brought lynch mobs. The region was slow to desegregate its schools and even slower to elect blacks to government, said Deborah Jeon, legal director for the A.C.L.U. of Maryland, which in the 1990s brought a voting rights case that forced changes in the way Pocomoke's surrounding county, Worcester, held elections.""It's not like the rest of Maryland; it's more like the Deep South,"" Ms. Jeon said. ""They fought us tooth and nail to prevent changes in the election system, even though the county had an all-white government for 250 years.""Poverty is a concern. Pocomoke's per capita income is $19,243, about half that of Maryland as a whole, and 27.1 percent of residents live below the poverty line. The rough side of town, known locally as ""the back burner,"" is overwhelmingly black, with run-down cinder block homes and a reputation for drugs and crime.""Coming to Pocomoke from Baltimore City,"" Mr. Sewell said, ""it feels like you go back in time.""Mr. Sewell's troubles began, both he and his lawyer Andrew McBride said, when a black detective, Franklin L. Savage, complained of racial harassment while assigned to a regional police task force on combating the drug trade.After a string of racially charged incidents -- including receiving a text message addressing him with a racial epithet and being driven by fellow officers down a street they called ""K.K.K. road"" -- Detective Savage asked to go back to his regular work in Pocomoke and complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, said Mr. McBride of the law firm Wiley Rein.But upon his return, Mr. McBride said, Detective Savage faced questions from city officials about his credibility, and wound up on night duty, which he construed as retaliation. Another black Pocomoke officer, Lt. Lynell Green, accompanied Detective Savage to a commission mediation session, and later complained of harassment as well. After that, Mr. McBride said, both officers were branded troublemakers, and city officials began pressuring Chief Sewell to fire them.When he would not, said Mr. McBride -- who is representing all three men with the nonprofit Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs -- the chief was fired. The other two officers remain on the force.William C. Hudson, the Pocomoke City solicitor, said that was not an accurate accounting of events, though like Mayor Morrison he would not offer specifics. ""When all the facts are known,"" he said, ""it will be clear that the city is guilty of no improprieties and that the action taken to relieve Chief Sewell was in the best interest of the community.""Perhaps, but ill will abounds. Diane Downing, the lone member of the City Council to oppose Chief Sewell's removal, said the mayor pushed the council to fire him -- in violation of the city charter, which does not give the mayor hiring or firing authority -- and begged her to vote in favor.""I am not stupid, and I was not born last night,"" she said. ""He wanted my vote because I am black.""The firing has stirred a new spirit of African-American activism. Black residents -- many wearing T-shirts bearing Mr. Sewell's likeness -- jammed the City Council chambers during a tense meeting after his dismissal. Pastor Jones and Pastor White have formed a coalition, Citizens for a Better Pocomoke, to prod blacks to get more involved in city government. Pastor Jones said they will not rest until the chief is back and the mayor is gone.""They woke the sleeping giant,"" said Gabe Purnell, an African-American activist from nearby Berlin, Md., who is advising the group.Whites, too, are organizing. At the Salem United Methodist Church, a white congregation, more than 100 people signed a letter Thursday backing the mayor. Both blacks and whites are bracing for the next City Council meeting, Monday night. A Justice Department spokeswoman said its mediators, who have no authority to investigate, ""remain available"" to ""facilitate any discussions"" if needed.Some wonder if Pocomoke will ever heal. Mayor Morrison insists everything will be fine: ""It's still the friendliest town on the Eastern Shore,"" he said, ""and I'll stick by that.""",0.0
The Price of Fear:   [Editorial ],,"After the attacks in Paris, the world is again challenged by fear. With every bombing, beheading and mass shooting, the dread spreads, along with the urgency of defeating this nihilism.But no less a challenge for the civilized world is the danger of self-inflicted injury. In the reaction and overreaction to terrorism comes the risk that society will lose its way.History is replete with examples of the power of fear and ignorance, to which even the great can fall prey. Franklin Roosevelt calmed a nation in bleakest days of the Depression, but he also signed the executive order imprisoning tens of thousands of American citizens for the crime of Japanese ancestry.In our time, disastrous things have been done in the name of safety: the invasion of Iraq, spawned by delusion and lies; the creation of an offshore fortress, sequestered from the Constitution, to lock up those perceived as threats, no matter the cost and injustice; an ever-expanding surveillance apparatus, to spy on the people, no matter the futility.Al Qaeda and the Islamic State did not compel us to shackle ourselves to a security state, or to disgrace our values by vilifying and fearing refugees and immigrants.This bitter truth is lost on the politicians now grasping for the Republican presidential nomination, whose guiding principle seems to be a crowd-pleasing strain of bullying cowardice. There is Donald Trump, who voiced his support for the registration of American Muslims. Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz think there is something proudly American about imposing a religious test on desperate refugees.As for the members of the House, Democratic and Republican, who voted to effectively shut down the Syrian and Iraqi refugee program, and the governors who would somehow block Syrians from their borders -- Americans should hope it's just fearful ignorance that clouds their vision, and that in time it clears.History will always be kinder to those who are resolute and brave. Like the Japanese-American soldiers of World War II, whose response to injustice was to fight overseas, defending democracy with their lives. Or the leaders today who have been calm in the crisis, willing to see and to say what the mob does not. People like the governor of Washington State, Jay Inslee, who has urged open doors for Syrian refugees, citing the Japanese-American internment as a disastrous precedent. ""We regret that,"" he said. ""We regret that we succumbed to fear.""Terrorist violence is terrifying, and it is natural to want to restore a shattered sense of safety. But the best way to do that has always been to draw upon our greatest ideals.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",0.0
The Hard Problem of Batteries:   Commentary,,"Steve LeVine became interested in batteries in the wake of the financial crisis. LeVine is the Washington correspondent for Quartz, a news site covering the global economy, and he sensed, he told me recently, ""a loss of confidence in the U.S. in our ability to create a real economy"" -- one based not on financial instruments or a real estate boom, but real products that would help create entire new industries.The battery could be such a product. Not just any battery, of course, but a battery designed for electric cars and capable of powering them for 200 miles or even 300 miles per charge. A battery that could compete with -- and eventually replace -- the internal combustion engine and transform the electric car from a niche product to a mass-market automobile.Such a battery does not yet exist. But if such a thing could be invented, it might well develop into a $100 billion-plus market in its first five or six years of existence, according to LeVine. A battery like that could vastly improve energy security. And with so much less exhaust spewed into the air, the effect on climate change could be lowered. The United States is trying to develop such a battery, and so are many other countries.That interest led LeVine to the Argonne National Laboratory, one of the Department of Energy's 17 national labs. For the better part of two years he was given access to its Battery Department, emerging with a captivating book entitled ""The Powerhouse: Inside the Invention of a Battery to Save the World.""With the closure or winnowing of many of corporate America's industrial labs -- not least the famed Bell Labs, which is a shadow of its once-mighty self -- industry now relies heavily on the federal government's national labs for basic scientific research. Thus it was that scientists at Argonne, which is in the Chicago suburbs, discovered a battery chemistry that greatly improved electric car performance, called NMC (for nickel-manganese-cobalt). The Chevrolet Volt uses a version of NMC, as will, reportedly, the next generation of Nissan Leafs. Which also suggests its drawback: the Volt only gets about 40 miles on pure battery power alone before it switches to its gasoline-powered engine.The core of LeVine's book is about the effort to take the next big step: create a battery that can achieve five times that mileage, while still remaining stable -- stability is always a big issue with batteries -- and affordable. The scientists at Argonne -- some of them larger-than-life figures in the battery world -- labeled this effort NMC 2.0. Though the writing can get technical at times, LeVine still tells a rollicking good tale. The scientists make a number of painstaking advances, inching the chemistry forward, only to discover problems. One such problem is called ""voltage fade"" -- an instability that is serious enough to make the battery unusable in an electric vehicle.There is also a private company in LeVine's narrative, a start-up called Envia Systems. Licensing the advances made by Argonne, it claims to have solved the rest of the puzzle. Its executives are persuasive enough that General Motors contracts with them to create the battery for an electric car it is calling, internally, the Bolt, which is supposed to get 200 miles per charge.LeVine told me that, for a long time, he fully expected that his book would end with Envia solving the riddle of NMC 2.0, and having a wildly successful public offering. But that's not what happens. As G.M., Argonne, and LeVine eventually discover, the Envia claims were wildly exaggerated. After G.M. found out that the company wouldn't be able to deliver after all, it ended its contract with the company and looked to LG Chem Ltd., the big South Korean company, to supply the battery.Indeed, by the end of the book, scientists still haven't solved the voltage fade problem, and NMC 2.0 seems as far away as ever. Argonne wins a competition set up by the Department of Energy to create a ""Battery Hub,"" in which more than a dozen national labs, universities and corporate partners will work together to completely rethink their approach to the conceptual leap the government -- and everyone else -- is hoping for. In effect, they're starting over.There is grist in ""The Powerhouse"" for critics of President Obama. He pushed for battery innovation just as he pushed for solar innovation. The latter gave us Solyndra; the former gave us Envia. Financing efforts to invent a new battery is, without question, a form of industrial policy.But LeVine thinks this view is misguided, and so do I. ""France and Germany and China have renewed their push for electric cars,"" he says. ""The stakes are so high and the dividends so rich that they keep going"" -- even if the quest seems, at times, quixotic.Besides, batteries are, as LeVine puts it, ""a hard problem."" If the government won't try to solve that problem, who will?",0.0
"A Sarcastic Critic of Politics and Media, Signing Off:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"On Thursday night 10 presidential candidates will spill onto a stage in Cleveland, and the already crowded Republican primary race will begin in earnest with the first day of debates, live on Fox News.The perfect Jon Stewart moment.But Mr. Stewart won't be around to skewer the participants. A couple of hours earlier, on the Far West Side of Manhattan, he will have already taped his final show.The timing is coincidental, but meaningful: Mr. Stewart has spent his career as host of the ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central having a field day with politicians (many of them Republican), outlandish billionaires (including Donald Trump) and cable news stations (Fox News in particular).Since Mr. Stewart started hosting ""The Daily Show"" 16 years ago, the country's trust in both the news media and the government has plummeted. Mr. Stewart's brand of fake news thrived in that vacuum, and turned him into one of the nation's most bracing cultural, political and media critics.With his over-the-top presentation of the news -- his arms swinging wildly, his eyes bulging with outrage, followed by a shake of the head and a knowing smile -- Mr. Stewart attracted a generation of viewers ready to embrace an outlier whose exaggerations, in their view, carried more truth than conventional newscasts.""He made the position what it was and he was smart and talented enough to imagine what this could be,"" Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, a Democrat and himself a former performer on ""Saturday Night Live,"" said in an interview. ""It evolved very quickly under his leadership and used the format of fake news to talk about everything and anything, and do it brilliantly.""When Mr. Stewart took over Comedy Central's late-night slot, replacing Craig Kilborn, the show was on a little-watched cable network, with around 350,000 viewers a night. That number grew year after year, and at its height, in the 2008-2009 season, it drew 1.6 million viewers a night, many of them young and left-leaning.But Mr. Stewart was far from a universally loved figure. His viewership, though a boon for Comedy Central, was much smaller than that of the network late-night shows. A Pew Research poll said there were nearly as many viewers who distrusted it as those who trusted it, and there was a significant divide among the liberals who craved it and conservatives who loathed it. Critics, even on the left, said he could come off as pompous and self-righteous.Still, the show's relentless focus on political news, and the amount of time Mr. Stewart, who is not granting interviews ahead of his departure, would devote to a certain topic each night, made him an object of fascination, especially among the press.""I think Stewart has it both ways,"" said Jeff Greenfield, the longtime TV news reporter. ""He says he's just a comedian but he's more than a comedian and I think he knows that. I spent three decades-plus doing network news but if you ask me today, what do I pay more attention to, John Oliver and Jon Stewart or the evening newscast, it's not close. I get much more out of Oliver and Stewart when he's cooking than I do out of those formulaic 22-minute newscasts.""""There are a lot of journalists who watch Stewart and envy the freedom he has,"" Mr. Greenfield added. ""You can't go on television when you're a journalist and say, 'Senator X is a bald-faced liar.' ""The show's producers and writers knew they had that in their favor. The show's popularity started to gain steam during the 2000 election, said Madeleine Smithberg, a creator of ""The Daily Show,"" especially in the monthlong drama after the election that led to the Bush v. Gore decision. ""We moved into the forefront in everybody's mind and everyone was watching us because we were the only ones who could call it for what it actually was,"" Ms. Smithberg said.By that point, Mr. Stewart had been host for two years and was zeroing in on the show's identity, a significant departure from his predecessor Mr. Kilborn, who was a former sports anchor.""The show certainly had not found itself by the time Craig had left,"" said Lewis Black, the comedian and longtime ""Daily Show"" contributor who worked with both hosts. ""The pieces were in place but it needed somebody to guide the ship in. Jon really became that person.""As that was happening, ""South Park"" was becoming a hit in its own right, and Comedy Central began to take off.""What Jon did was put us into the national conversation and put us into the zeitgeist and the front page,"" said Doug Herzog, the president of the Viacom Music and Entertainment group.It's a platform that has turned Mr. Stewart's little-known replacement, the 31-year-old Trevor Noah, into an overnight celebrity. And the show has likewise minted many stars, including Stephen Colbert, who is replacing David Letterman next month; John Oliver, who now has his own show on HBO; Steve Carell; Ed Helms; Larry Wilmore; and Samantha Bee.There have been many milestones: Mr. Stewart's coverage of the Bush White House; the show's best-selling book, ""America: A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction""; his confrontations with CNBC's Jim Cramer; and his feuds with Fox News. (Mr. Stewart revisited that topic on the show Monday night, after Fox News accused him of being too cozy with the Obama administration because he had visited the president at the White House.)In 2010, Mr. Stewart and Mr. Colbert organized a gathering that attracted thousands in Washington, called the ""Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear,"" in response to the conservative commentator Glenn Beck and the growing Tea Party movement. That same year, his determined advocacy of a bill to provide aid to 9/11 responders was widely cited as the reason it passed through Congress.There are signs, however, that the show's best days are behind it. It has had a declining audience for three straight years, and its average for total viewers this season is about 1.35 million, its lowest since 2005. The viewership in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic, at 725,000 viewers a night, is at its lowest in 11 years, according to data from Nielsen.Mr. Herzog, of Viacom, took issue with the figures, arguing that including viewers who were watching parts of his show online, ""Jon's probably more impactful than ever.""Mr. Black said that Mr. Stewart might have benefited most from the news events that marked his tenure -- from the Bush administration to the wars in the Middle East to the rise of 24-hour news channels and the emergence of Barack Obama and the Tea Party.""The show gained its power not just from Jon and not just from the writers of the show, but also the time frame in which it occurred,"" Mr. Black said.""He would turn out every day and do something that would provide people a certain amount of insulation from the madness we're bombarded with from the moment we wake up,"" he continued. ""Whether someone is bombing this place or someone is shooting someone, or some senator said something so profoundly beyond human comprehension that one would consider it fictional if one didn't know this was a real person. But laughter? Laughter allows you to say, 'Ah! I am not a part of this,' and you disengage for a moment.""Photograph Jon Stewart Will Host His Final ""Daily Show"" On Thursday, After 16 Years.

Crisis in Ukraine Underscores Opposing Lessons of Cold War:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MUNICH -- The Cold War is history, but its spirit this weekend stalked the security conference held here each winter for the past 51 years.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Senator John McCain drew very different lessons from the West's 20th-century showdown with the Soviet Union, as they clashed over whether to arm Kiev's troops in response to Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine. That disagreement represents one of the sharpest rifts yet over how the allies should respond to the current challenge from Moscow.Europe is very different from the days when the militaries of NATO and the Soviet bloc stared each other down. But the crisis in Ukraine has reopened familiar differences as to whether the threat of force -- in this case, Washington's readiness to bolster Ukraine's military against pro-Russian rebels backed by the Kremlin -- is more effective than months of so-far failed negotiations.It is not quite Winston Churchill's choice of ""jaw-jaw"" or ""war-war."" Everyone agreed that a negotiated solution is the preferred outcome. Secretary of State John Kerry, addressing the conference on Sunday, insisted therefore that the West is united.But even he said that ""we are in the midst of a defining moment"" in the trans-Atlantic partnership, and there were differences over tactics as leaders headed into another round of talks this week.Ms. Merkel travels to Washington for talks on Monday with President Obama, who is said to be undecided on whether to provide Ukraine with anti-tank artillery and an array of communications and other equipment, which some American officials say could enable Ukraine to build and hold a line against pro-Russian forces moving west in eastern Ukraine.Diplomats will gather for more talks in Berlin on Tuesday. An additional summit of the leaders of France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia is to be held in Minsk, Belarus, on Wednesday.Speaking in Sochi, Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said that a Wednesday meeting would require agreement between Russia and the West on key points beforehand. A meeting then is possible if ""we are able to agree on a number of points that we've recently been discussing intensely,"" he said.On Sunday, Mr. Kerry issued a statement of support for the European efforts, but noted that Washington is concerned by new reports of ""fierce fighting today in Debaltseve and Mariupol, and press references to new Russian convoys into eastern Ukraine.""Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, spoke Saturday of the real danger of a new division in Europe and a ""parting of the ways"" with Mr. Putin if negotiations fail.Laurent Fabius, foreign minister of France, was firm on Sunday that ""what we must seek right now is not peace on paper but peace on the ground.""That echoed comments by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who recalled the many hours he had spent trying to end the conflict.""Don't tell us. Show us, President Putin,"" he said Saturday. ""Too many times President Putin has promised peace and delivered tanks, weapons.""Mr. Putin's view has been that the crisis in Ukraine, far from being a violation of international law, has been caused by a peremptory West eager to impose its way on Russia. Accordingly, his foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, delivered a speech brimming with Cold War-style bromides at the alleged strength of fascists in Ukraine, or Kiev's supposed mistreatment of ethnic Hungarian minorities, which the Russians have cited as causes for them to support the rebels.Emotion is sometimes rare in international diplomacy, but was very much present in the public and private discourse here all weekend.Unusually, Ms. Merkel offered up a memory of her childhood in Communist East Germany in reply to Malcolm Rifkind, a former British foreign and defense secretary, who questioned whether the diplomacy she has pursued in the Ukraine crisis was effective without a threat of force.""Look,"" said Ms. Merkel, who, like President François Hollande of France, had just returned from hours of negotiations with Mr. Putin, ""I grew up in East Germany, and when I was 7 the Berlin Wall was built.""Nobody expected the West to mount a military attack to bring it down, she said, meaning that East Germans waited 28 more years in ""dictatorship and unfreedom"" until the Wall came down in November 1989.She did not begrudge the West, Ms. Merkel said. But she implied that it informed her idea that ""I do not believe that the advances Ukraine needs will be achieved with weapons.""Senator McCain, Republican of Arizona, in remarks on Saturday and a speech on Sunday, rebuffed the chancellor, despite German complaints about his tone while in the country she heads.""Asserting that there is no military solution, which is a truism, should not lead us to believe that there is no military dimension to the problem -- or that hard power can play no role in a favorable solution,"" Mr. McCain told the conference.Responding to Ms. Merkel's Berlin Wall story, Mr. McCain said Saturday, ""What I particularly took exception to was Chancellor Merkel comparing this situation with that during the Cold War.""Hundreds of thousands of Americans had defended West Germany, and ""when Berlin was surrounded, we sent in an airlift,"" he said, recalling the mission that broke the Soviet blockade of Berlin in the late 1940s. ""We didn't say, 'Hey, we don't want to provoke the Russians.' So I just take strong exception to that comparison.""He said the Soviets were kept at bay during the Cold War by ""the price they would have to pay for their aggression, and right now there is no price that Putin is paying for his aggression.""Mr. McCain's view contrasted with the vision of Mr. Steinmeier, who emphasized the need for a peaceful end to the conflict through negotiations.""It would be irresponsible not to use the opportunities we have,"" Mr. Steinmeier said.He spoke broadly of a new ""security model"" that might restore trust with Russia, an idea that seems distant as death and misery spreads in eastern Ukraine.The German foreign minister recalled that a Canadian colleague at a NATO meeting last summer had asked whether Russia should be seen as ""a friend, partner, enemy or opponent to us.""""Perhaps,"" Mr. Steinmeier said, ""this is easier to answer when you are further away from the conflict region. Our experience in Europe -- in good times or bad -- is that Russia remains our neighbor.""It was an observation steeped in decades of Ostpolitik, Germany's policy of détente with Eastern Europe, forged by German Social Democrats like Mr. Steinmeier.Ms. Merkel, a center-right Christian Democrat, governs in coalition with the Social Democrats, another factor influencing her Ukraine policy, in which the two politicians from opposing camps have so far been able to keep the support of most Germans.President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine said Sunday that any Minsk meeting should result in a durable and effective cease-fire in his country. European and American leaders expressed hope that their unity, and not their differences, would prevail.""We have to stick together and we have to negotiate,"" Mr. Fabius said, ""but not agree to concessions that would undermine the key pillars of European security. It is the time to make a choice.""",0.0
Don't Let Progress on Tobacco Evaporate:   [Editorial ],,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported this month that the adult smoking rate in the United States has fallen to a new low, a testament to the decades of education about the dangers of tobacco and measures to discourage its use. Now Republicans in the House are seeking to slash the very government programs that have helped to achieve such remarkable success.Cigarette smoking among adults has been declining since 1965, but in the mid-2000s progress stalled, mostly because state tobacco control programs were curtailed. In 2009, the country was back on track, thanks to an increase in the federal tax on cigarettes and a new law granting the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate tobacco products. Progress has been furthered by insurance coverage for smoking-cessation programs under the Affordable Care Act. The percentage of adults who smoke fell from 20.9 percent in 2005 to 17.8 percent in 2013, 16.8 percent in 2014 and 14.9 percent in the first half of 2015.That progress might well be slowed or reversed if Congress approves two riders attached to an appropriations bill for the 2016 fiscal year by a Republican-dominated House committee. One rider would cut in half the C.D.C.'s budget for tobacco control, from $216.5 million in 2015 to $105.5 million in 2016. That would almost certainly force the agency to eliminate its highly successful ""TIPS From Former Smokers"" media campaign, which has been a very cost-effective effort at persuading smokers to quit. The rider would also reduce federal financing to help states, tribes and territories reduce smoking and operate state ""quitlines,"" phone numbers people can call for help.The second rider would shield from regulation all existing electronic cigarettes, including thousands of flavored products that are designed to attract young people and have become increasingly popular, according to C.D.C. surveys. Dozens of medical organizations have opposed the riders and language that jeopardizes support for surveys that document trends in tobacco use.The Senate has a far more rational approach. The Appropriations Committee recommended the full $216.5 million for tobacco programs at the C.D.C. and did nothing to weaken the F.D.A.'s regulatory powers. Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States. This is no time to slack off.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",0.0

"Passion, Desolation and Chemistry:   [The Arts/Cultural Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDED. There was something a bit perverse about the chamber-music program presented by the New York Philharmonic at the 92nd Street Y on Sunday, part of its three-week Rachmaninoff festival. Sure, the promise of the breathtaking pianist Daniil Trifonov joining forces with the violinist Sheryl Staples and the cellist Carter Brey in the seething ""Trio Élégiaque"" (Op. 9) was all it took to fill the Kaufmann Concert Hall. But to round out the program with two unfinished string quartets -- works that Rachmaninoff abandoned, surely with good reason -- when there is a luscious, masterly cello sonata begging to be played?The emotionally charged performance of the trio, with its moments of heated passion and abject desolation, hinted at a special chemistry among these players, and Mr. Brey and Mr. Trifonov would no doubt have done wonders with that sonata. But at least one of the quartet fragments was here a psychologically revealing marker in the musical development of a composer whose chamber music often absorbed his darkest moods.The Op. 9 trio begins and ends with a somber procession. In between, there are soulful string melodies and magnificent outbursts of pianistic virtuosity, which Mr. Trifonov dispatched with balled power and ringing tone. But most memorable was the end: the strings' sound drained of vibrato, the piano's hooded and wary.The same ashes-to-ashes arc governs the slow movement of the String Quartet No. 2, for which the violinist Michelle Kim and the violist Cynthia Phelps joined Ms. Staples and Mr. Brey. It takes the form of a passacaglia on a pessimistic bass line that creeps up three steps and back again, with the viola responding in little shudders. The music grows more emphatic but never manages to shake the sense of futility to which it succumbs.The String Quartet No. 1 offered only episodic pleasures. Here, in a reversal of many concert experiences, it was the music that failed to rise to the level of the elegant, classy playing.",0.0
New Testament Papyrus Is Discovered on eBay:   [The Arts/Cultural Desk ] [1 ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. Last January, Geoffrey Smith, a scholar of early Christianity at the University of Texas, noticed something startling: an eBay listing for an ancient Greek papyrus fragment of the Gospel of John -- with an opening bid of only $99.""I thought, This can't be allowed to sell on eBay,"" Dr. Smith said. ""It will just disappear into a private collection.""Dr. Smith contacted the seller and urged him to halt the online auction -- apparently the first on eBay for a Greek New Testament papyrus, he and other scholars said -- and let him study the fragment. The seller agreed, and now, on Saturday, Mr. Smith will present his research at the annual conference of the Society of Biblical Literature in Atlanta.The credit-card-size papyrus, which Dr. Smith dates from around A.D. 250 to A.D. 350, contains about six lines of the Gospel of John on one side and an unidentified Christian text on the other. If Dr. Smith's analysis is correct, it is the only known Greek New Testament papyrus from an unused scroll rather than a codex, the emerging book technology that early Christians, in sharp contrast to their Jewish and pagan contemporaries, preferred for their texts.That adds an interesting wrinkle, scholars say, to the story of the rise of the codex, the book as we know it today. But the dramatic story of the papyrus's emergence also speaks to a distinctly 21st-century technological anxiety.""The fact that this one came to light on the Internet speaks to the reality for all of us who deal with manuscripts and antiquities,"" Dr. Smith said. ""We're all trying to come to terms with these things we study, our prized scholarly possessions, are now coming up for sale online.""Greek New Testament papyri are among the oldest and rarest traces of Christian scripture. Only about 130 have been recognized by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research in Münster, Germany, which registers New Testament manuscripts of all types and oversees the effort to reconstruct the Greek initial text from surviving variants.They are also a new entry into the growing -- and, many scholars say, ethically questionable -- online marketplace in ancient papyri.""History doesn't belong to one person,"" said Brice C. Jones, a papyrus expert who tracks online sales, and who wrote about the eBay listing on his blog the same day Dr. Smith noticed it, inadvertently sending bids shooting up.""Collectively, globally, it's ours,"" continued Dr. Jones, who also communicated with the seller, who wishes to remain anonymous. ""It needs to be available for research, to be put on display.""Many scholars refuse to study manuscripts that may have left their country of origin illegally, and some refuse to study material in private collections, on the grounds it helps drive the market.That market is certainly robust. A third-century fragment of Romans on vellum, Dr. Jones noted, sold last year at Sotheby's for nearly $500,000. The seller of the John papyrus, meanwhile, was ""harassed by collectors offering him absurd amounts of money,"" Dr. Smith said, declining to cite a specific figure.While the original provenance of the Gospel of John papyrus is not known, Dr. Smith said that ownership appeared to comply with the Unesco convention, which declares that cultural property legally acquired before 1970 cannot be subject to repatriation claims. (Virtually all papyri come from Egypt.)Dr. Smith declined to identify the seller. But in the text of the listing copied on Dr. Jones's blog, the seller said the papyrus had been in the private collection of Harold R. Willoughby, a professor of early Christianity at the University of Chicago who died in 1962.The seller, who identified himself in the listing as a relative of Mr. Willoughby, told Mr. Smith that he had found the papyrus only recently, after opening a suitcase of Mr. Willoughby's possessions that he had acquired in 1990 and stashed in his attic.The fragment, which was encased in glass, ""literally fell out of a stack of letters,"" the seller said in the listing.Both a collection inventory written in Mr. Willoughby's handwriting and a typed estate inventory compiled after his death listed the papyrus, thus confirming, Dr. Smith said, that it had been part of his collection in 1962.The eBay listing identified the item's location as New Hampshire. Dr. Smith inspected and photographed it during a visit with the seller in March in an undisclosed meeting place. ""I have no knowledge of where it is being stored,"" he said. ""But it didn't look like it has suffered any recent damage.""What the wider scholarly community will make of the new papyrus remains to be seen. But experts who have reviewed Dr. Smith's research say he has made a strong case -- based on highly technical aspects of the papyrus -- that it is from a scroll, not a codex.That may seem like a subtle point, but it's significant, scholars say. Larry Hurtado, an expert in early Christian manuscripts at the University of Edinburgh, said in an interview that early Christianity was ""a bookish religion"" that displayed a ""maniacal preoccupation with texts,"" with a clear preference for the codex at a time when it was far from obvious to most people that it was more user-friendly.According to Dr. Hurtado's calculations, 97 percent of Christian biblical texts that survive from the first three centuries A.D., including those from the Old Testament, are codexes. Except for a few texts on the back of previously used scrolls, all known Greek New Testament papyri are codexes.The new papyrus, on which the John text appears to be on the front of the scroll, ""breaks that pattern,"" Dr. Hurtado said. ""This shows that preference was not absolute.""The fact that it has another text copied on the other side (seemingly in the same low-quality handwriting), Dr. Hurtado added, suggests that it was intended for private study, rather than liturgical use.""What we may have here is someone's prized possession,"" he said.AnneMarie Luijendijk, a professor of religion at Princeton University who also reviewed Dr. Smith's paper, said that to her, the most intriguing aspect of the manuscript is that both the John text and the unidentified Christian text appear to be in the same handwriting -- a very unusual feature for any of the reused scrolls, Christian or otherwise, that survive from antiquity, she said.""If it was in a personal library, and then the same scribe turned it around to write the other text, what does that mean?"" Dr. Luijendijk said. ""It's really puzzling.""Dr. Smith said he continued to urge the seller to place the papyrus in a research library. He is also working on another Greek New Testament papyrus, a fragment of Ephesians that he found the old-fashioned way: in a huge cache of manuscripts at Oxford University excavated in Egypt in the late 19th and early 20th century.That pipeline of new material, he said, had slowed in more recent years, increasing pressure on scholars to be open to less traditional sources.""It's possible for things to come up online that are completely legal to own,"" Dr. Smith said. ""When things show up with appropriate documentation, we need to become more comfortable with studying them.""",0.0
A Pro Basketball Podcast Finds Success on Television:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"""Is Russell Westbrook a cat or a dog?""Westbrook is, in fact, the star point guard for the Oklahoma City Thunder, so this was a somewhat jarring question to pose to his fellow players during the National Basketball Association's All-Star weekend in 2013. Nonetheless, they played along.James Harden thought Westbrook was more of a dog. Dwyane Wade hedged. ""He's a cat-dog,"" he said.Finally, Westbrook weighed in. ""Wolf,"" he said.The cat-or-dog question came from a host of ""The Basketball Jones,"" an N.B.A. podcast started in 2006 by three Canadian basketball fanatics who will bring their blend of deep basketball analysis and irreverent, goofy attitude to the N.B.A.'s All-Star festivities this weekend in New York.""I always think we were made for All-Star weekend, because it's supposed to be fun,"" says Phil Elder, one of the hosts, who is known professionally as J. E. Skeets.But this year, the hosts of ""The Jones"" will be broadcasting for the league itself. A little more than a year ago, ""The Jones"" podcast was rebranded as ""The Starters,"" a television program shown weeknights on NBATV. It is available to stream live and download as a podcast but it exists primarily as a television broadcast. In its second season, ""The Starters"" is growing quickly in popularity. According to the network, viewership has increased by 24 percent this season, with podcast downloads up 22 percent. NBATV says it will continue to raise the show's profile. Plans for this weekend include an hourlong live show at 6 p.m. Friday, with player interviews and an appearance by the basketball great George Gervin.""They prove you can be entertaining and smart on TV without being overbearing and loud about it,"" said Zach Lowe, an N.B.A. writer for the Grantland website and a podcaster.In the wake of the hit true-crime show ""Serial,"" podcasts are widely acknowledged to be growing. A recent report from Edison Research indicates a ""dramatic increase in podcast consumption.""Jeff Ullrich, the co-founder of the podcasting network Earwolf, says the shift has been palpable.""My 70-year-old retired dentist in St. Charles, Ill., is telling me that he can relate to the thing that I have done in my career, when 18 months ago my best friends didn't know what a podcast was,"" he said.""The Starters"" hosts are part of a wave of podcasting personalities jumping to television, including the soccer commentators ""Men in Blazers,"" the comedian Marc Maron and the hosts of ""Comedy Bang Bang."" But the basketball enthusiasts acknowledge that the shift can be challenging. ""The Starters"" television show occasionally feels less rich to longtime fans of the podcasts.""What you're hearing on the podcast is years of repetition and experience, so it's kind of ingrained in us, and it's pretty easy,"" said one of the hosts, Tassos Melas, who goes by Tas. ""While on the TV side, not that we're not good at it, but it's different every year. It's just not shooting the breeze as easily,"" he said.""They're two completely different mediums,"" Mr. Elder said. ""Everyone was telling us, 'It's not the same, it's not the same.' Well it's not the same because it's a TV show we're making.""Though ""The Starters' "" television audience is growing, Mr. Elder and Mr. Melas, with the show's other personalities, Trey Kerby and Leigh Ellis, have not abandoned podcasting. This season they introduced ""The Drop,"" a weekly, podcast-only show that is downloaded 70 percent more frequently on average than the podcast of the daily ""The Starters"" television show, according to the network. Last week's episode featured references to Katy Perry's Super Bowl halftime show and a discussion of some of the more handsome N.B.A. stars.""The Starters"" TV show has tried to incorporate the lighter elements of ""The Basketball Jones"" podcast in a way that recreates the spontaneity of its hosts' old material. On their show last Thursday, in a segment called ""Meme Team,"" the hosts counted down some of the goofiest moments from the N.B.A. that week. Number one on the countdown was Westbrook's reaction to being stiffed on a high five by a teammate. In the video, he turned around sharply and glared at the offending player.""That screams cat to me,"" Mr. Elder said. ""Case closed, right? He's more like a cat.""Photograph ""The Starters"" Personalities, From Left, Trey Kerby, Phil Elder, Tassos Melas and Leigh Ellis.",0.0
"Rapper, Shaped by Tumultuous German Youth, Is Designated a Global Terrorist:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BERLIN -- Denis Cuspert was drawn early to gangsta rap, and later to Islam. Born and raised in West Berlin, jeered at as a half-African child and often at odds with his American stepfather, he fell in with Salafists in Germany, left for Egypt in 2012 and made his way, eventually, to Syria. By last spring, the German authorities said, he had joined Islamic State guerrillas and swore allegiance to their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.This week, Mr. Cuspert was transformed again. The American State Department announced Monday that, as ""a willing pitchman"" for the extremist group's ""atrocities,"" Mr. Cuspert was now a ""specially designated global terrorist"" sought worldwide.The designation means that Mr. Cuspert, 39, has gone from being a notorious figure in Germany to one recognized everywhere, and it puts him in the cross hairs of American intelligence in the Syrian region.The potential evidence against him includes a July 2014 video that, a German report says, shows Mr. Cuspert and a pile of corpses in civilian clothes, apparently victims of a battle for control of the much-contested Shaer gas field near Homs in Syria.""Cuspert has been on the radar for a while, mainly because he's so high profile,"" said a former senior American counterterrorism official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence reports.The announcement in Washington followed declarations by President Obama and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Monday, during her visit to the White House, about their continuing cooperation in tracking terror suspects and gathering intelligence in the region.The relationship between Germany and the United States on intelligence-gathering was shaken in 2013 after Edward J. Snowden revealed the extent to which ordinary Germans were affected and Der Spiegel reported that the Americans had eavesdropped on Ms. Merkel's cellphone.At the White House on Monday, Mr. Obama appealed to Germans, who are sensitive about government surveillance because of their Nazi and Communist pasts, to trust Americans not to overstep the line. Ms. Merkel, in turn, stressed how Germany relies on the United States' intelligence-gathering capacity to guarantee public safety.State Department officials in Washington said on Tuesday that the designation of Mr. Cuspert had been published without fanfare in the American government's Federal Register on Jan. 27.Mr. Cuspert, a.k.a. the rapper Deso Dogg, now goes by Abu Talha al-Almani, according to German and American officials.He became one of the best-known singers of nasheeds, or Islamic devotional music, in German. According to security officials and excerpts from videos posted online, Mr. Cuspert sings of the comradeship of battle.His themes include martyrdom: ""I wish for my death and can hardly wait for it/Armed with bombs and grenades,"" goes one song from 2013, according to a report on Mr. Cuspert compiled by security officials in Berlin.That report concluded that ""in just four years, he developed from a respected, but financially not very successful, 'gangsta rapper' to an internationally recognized propagandist of jihad and Salafism.""Mr. Cuspert was born in Berlin to a German mother and a Ghanaian father who soon left the family. His American stepfather, a former soldier, was a strict disciplinarian, and conflicts at home increased until Mr. Cuspert spent five years in a home for troubled children. ""I grew up with racism,"" he told The New York Times in 2011.He said he had joined youth gangs because he was in search of an identity. From an early age, he trained in Thai boxing, taekwondo and jujitsu.His rap career reached its zenith when he went on tour with DMX in 2006.By 2010, according to Berlin security officials, he had appeared in a video with Pierre Vogel, a well-known Salafist preacher, who asked about rap connections and what might happen if other rappers embraced Islam.In 2011, when a 21-year-old immigrant from Kosovo, Arid Uka, fatally shot two American airmen at the Frankfurt airport, he said he had opened fire after seeing a video that claimed to show a Muslim woman being raped by men in United States military uniforms. Mr. Cuspert acknowledged posting the video, which Mr. Uka copied. American officials said it was staged.In 2012, Mr. Cuspert fell in with an Austrian, Mohamed Mahmoud, and they started a group, Millatu Ibrahim, that was banned after a clash with the police. The two men left for Egypt, reportedly heading for Mali, but landed eventually in Syria.There, according to German intelligence officials, Mr. Cuspert suffered head wounds in battle in September 2013, but after hospitalization in Turkey returned to the fighting last spring.The Berlin report on Mr. Cuspert, published last September, concluded with mention of the video that it said showed him among the pile of corpses.Frauke Köhler, a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor's office in Germany, declined to confirm a news report that Mr. Cuspert was being investigated on suspicion of committing war crimes, along with another German jihadist, identified as Farid S., whose wife is on trial in Düsseldorf on charges of delivering 11,000 euros and camera equipment to her husband in Syria.Robert Rigney, a Berlin-born American who said he had spent almost 15 years here, teaching and writing about immigrant communities, said he had come across Mr. Cuspert in Berlin's Kreuzberg district around 2009.""Everyone in Berlin knows this guy,"" he said, alluding to immigrant neighborhoods and the high school dropouts, and rap fans, he teaches.

Pomegranate Juice Maker Loses Trademark Fight:   [Brief ],,"The pomegranate juice maker Pom Wonderful cannot stop a smaller rival from selling a pomegranate-flavored energy drink with a similar name, a federal court ruled on Thursday. It was the second time Pom Wonderful had failed to obtain an injunction against the energy drink labeled ""pom,"" made by Pur Beverages, in a continuing trademark dispute. Judge Margaret M. Morrow of United States District Court in Los Angeles said in her ruling that Pom did not deserve an injunction because it could not show it would be harmed without one. Pom sued Robert Hubbard, Pur Beverages' founder, in 2013 for trademark infringement, saying consumers would be deceived into thinking Mr. Hubbard's energy drink was associated with Pom Wonderful. Pom said that its reputation as a health-conscious brand would suffer if it were associated with Mr. Hubbard's beverage.

Chief of Pfizer Defends Merger as Good for U.S.:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"In phone calls to Washington lawmakers and Obama administration officials, the chief executive of the largest drug maker in the nation had a surprising message: A deal that would allow the company to move its headquarters to Ireland was actually good for the United States.The Scottish-born chief executive of Pfizer, Ian C. Read, told them that a merger with Allergan, the maker of Botox that is based in Dublin, would significantly cut Pfizer's tax bill and give it more cash that it could invest in the United States and ultimately add jobs, according to people briefed on the calls. He made the calls in recent days as the two companies were hammering out a $152 billion deal.Monday's announcement of the deal -- the biggest merger in 15 years -- has revived a fierce public debate over whether mergers that allow a company in the United States to relocate to a lower-tax country are, in fact, good for America.Pfizer, founded by German immigrants in Brooklyn in 1849, is becoming the biggest company yet to shed its American citizenship to lower its taxes. While not structured as what is known as an inversion, it achieves the same goal of a lower tax rate abroad.An aborted bid by Pfizer to acquire AstraZeneca of Britain in an inversion last year set off a public uproar -- leading President Obama to call such deals ""unpatriotic"" -- and prompted moves by the Treasury to curb them.The latest merger announcement has stirred a similar outcry across the political spectrum.Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Democratic candidate for president, said, ""We cannot delay in cracking down on inversions that erode our tax base.""Donald J. Trump, a Republican candidate for president, said in a statement: ""The fact that Pfizer is leaving our country with a tremendous loss of jobs is disgusting. Our politicians should be ashamed.""Yet the two companies and their advisers are betting that the Treasury Department will not be able to come up with new rules to block the union, and that Congress will fail to revamp the tax code before the merger's expected close late next year.And as Mr. Read has made clear publicly and privately, his main priority is doing well by his shareholders -- and that means finding a way to compete with huge foreign rivals that enjoy much lower tax rates.""We've assessed the legal, regulatory and political landscape and are moving forward with our strategy to combine these two great companies for the benefit of the patients and to bring value to shareholders,"" Mr. Read said on Monday on a call with analysts. ""That is our obligation.""Mr. Read and those close to him have noted that Pfizer, based in New York, has been upfront about its intentions. Even after its takeover campaign for AstraZeneca collapsed, the Pfizer chief made no secret of his desire to try again, while criticizing a tax code that he said leaves his company fighting with one hand tied behind its back.The drug maker, which manufactured penicillin during World War II, has complained that its tax rate last year was 26 percent, compared with the approximately 5 percent that Allergan's predecessor company paid during that same time.Bigger international rivals, from GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca of Britain to Novartis of Switzerland, also pay substantially less in taxes, potentially letting them win takeover contests with higher bids.Perhaps more important, Pfizer kept overseas $74 billion in profits that were earned abroad last year, because bringing them home would have racked up billions of dollars in taxes.Since the AstraZeneca bid, the Obama administration has introduced new rules that have made it harder for companies to do inversion deals, scuttling efforts by companies like AbbVie, a large drug maker based in Illinois, to relocate abroad.From the beginning of their deal discussions nearly three months ago, Pfizer and Allergan agreed that the best way forward was to forgo an inversion altogether, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Instead, Allergan would serve as the buyer despite being substantially smaller.Mindful of the sensitivity in Washington, Pfizer included in its advisory team the boutique investment bank Moelis & Company, whose vice chairman is Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader.While Mr. Cantor will not lobby lawmakers, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, he has advised the company on political aspects of the deal and maintains friendly contact with his former colleagues.Despite the political uproar, the merger is not expected to encounter significant resistance from the American regulator that will review the transaction, the Federal Trade Commission, according to the people with direct knowledge of the deal.A spokesman for the Treasury Department said on Monday that it did not comment on specific transactions. Still, the department has clearly signaled its distaste for deals that move a company's tax home.The particular design of Monday's transaction, however, effectively shields Pfizer and Allergan from the administration's efforts to curb such deals.When the Treasury Department announced its latest rule changes on Thursday, advisers to both companies sat down to review the changes -- and quickly went back to work on their negotiations, the people with direct knowledge of the matter said.""Treasury's proposals don't touch them,"" said Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant who examined the deal.Presidential candidates offered swift condemnation of the transaction all the same.Such transactions, Mrs. Clinton said, ""take advantage of loopholes that litter our tax code, distort incentives for investment and disadvantage small businesses and domestic firms that cannot game the international tax system.""Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic candidate for president, said, ""The Obama administration has the authority to stop this merger, and it should exercise that authority.""Yet others said a broader tax overhaul was needed.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the news of the merger ""only further underscores the arcane, anticompetitive nature of the U.S. tax code.""Executives at both Pfizer and Allergan are betting that Congress will continue to be conflicted about how to deal with inversions. Republicans, who control the House and the Senate, have called for a comprehensive regulatory overhaul and have shown reluctance to focus on particular companies.""It's not clear what Washington's wishes are,"" said one person close to the transaction. ""We tried to tell them to fix our tax system. It's not like this is a surprise.""At the same time, both Mr. Read and his counterpart at Allergan, Brenton L. Saunders, have emphasized that the deal isn't being done just to cut taxes.Both executives contend the deal gives Pfizer access to fast-growing treatments in the eye care and dermatology space, as well as brands like Botox and the cosmetic treatment Juvéderm.Moreover, it will give Pfizer enough size and product diversity to break itself up in three years' time, dividing itself into a company focused on faster-growing innovative drugs and another built on more mature treatments that face competition from generic competitors. The company said on Monday that it would decide in late 2018 whether to proceed with a split.Buying Allergan will bring more fast-growing treatments to Pfizer's portfolio. That would complement Pfizer's $17 billion acquisition of the generic drug maker Hospira earlier this year, meant to bulk up its so-called established treatments division.Under the terms of the deal, Pfizer would essentially pay $363.63 for each Allergan share, representing a nearly 30 percent premium to Allergan's share price in late October before news emerged that they were in talks. That values the acquisition at $152 billion. Including debt and subtracting cash, the deal is worth $160 billion.After the transaction, Pfizer shareholders are expected to own about 56 percent of the combined company, with the remaining 44 percent owned by Allergan shareholders. Mr. Read will be chief executive of the new Pfizer P.L.C., to be based in Dublin, while Mr. Saunders will become president, and will be in line to take over one of the company's businesses if and when it decides to break itself up.Investors appeared unimpressed. Shares of Allergan fell 3.4 percent, while Pfizer's ended down 2.6 percent.The expected cost savings of about $2 billion over the first three years announced after the deal was made were well below most analysts' projections. And the $5 billion in planned stock buybacks that also were announced on Monday were in line with Pfizer's previous efforts.Some analysts still regarded the deal positively, so far as it ties into Pfizer's goals.""Allergan was easier to get done as a friendly deal in terms of getting a structure done and management roles done,"" said Jeffrey Holford, an analyst with Jefferies.To some involved in the deal, the tax savings are all that matters. ""If the tax stuff went away entirely, the deal would be off,"" a person briefed on Mr. Read's thinking said.",0.0
Women Seek a Bigger Beanpot:   [Sports Desk ],,"BOSTON -- Before the first women's Beanpot hockey tournament, in 1979, Harvard Coach Joe Bertagna purchased a two-toned brown beanpot for $6 at Howard's Flying Dragon Antiques in Essex, Mass.For 35 years, until a more regal-looking silver trophy replaced it in 2014, Bertagna's beanpot was awarded to the tournament's champion and treated like the Stanley Cup -- in stature and as a celebratory prop.""It's probably a little worse for the wear after we were done with it,"" said Alison Quandt, a goaltender on Boston College's 2006 team that won the Eagles' first Beanpot title. The men's Beanpot, featuring Boston College, Boston University, Northeastern and Harvard, began in 1952 and is quite possibly the most prestigious in-season tournament in college hockey. Bertagna and the other teams' coaches formulated the idea for a women's Beanpot at a bar in Harvard Square in the late 1970s, and since 1979, the women's Beanpot tournament has been played with the tradition of the men's tournament, if not the pomp.The women's competition has grown to include some of the game's premier players, but they are still fighting to gain recognition from a larger audience.In Tuesday's final, No. 1 Boston College (27-0-1) will play No. 4 Harvard (18-4-2). Boston University, which fell in the opening round to Harvard, 9-2, on Feb. 3, was ranked sixth at the time. Northeastern has won a record 16 tournament titles.""Our kids get up for the Beanpot even more than maybe a Hockey East championship game,"" said Northeastern Coach Dave Flint, whose team lost, 3-1, to Boston College in the opening round.While Boston College was the favorite entering this year's tournament, Harvard and Northeastern dominated for decades, combining to win 25 of the first 27 championships, often by lopsided scores. In 1995, Northeastern defeated Boston University, 24-0, in the first round.A contributing factor to the imbalance was the varsity status of the Harvard and Northeastern teams, while Boston University and Boston College competed at the club level. During the past 10 years, though, as all four teams began operating as Division I programs, the four Boston-area teams have developed into perennial contenders, combining for eight Frozen Four appearances. Boston College has won five Beanpot titles in the past nine years.Bertagna, who is now the Hockey East commissioner and has been the women's tournament administrator since 2004, said the success of the women's teams validated the increased support from within their respective athletic departments.In the early Beanpot years, respect and money for women's hockey were scarce.Diane DerBoghosian, who won the first women's Beanpot's Most Valuable Player Award for Northeastern in 1979, started a club team with several other female students at Northeastern whom she met in weekend recreation leagues. They held bake sales for financing and car-pooled to games to save money. DerBoghosian often drove her 1977 brown Ford Pinto, which was purchased for $800 and barely carried four players and their equipment.The team also practiced at the whim of the men's team.""Our ice time wasn't always at ideal times,"" DerBoghosian said. ""We had to take a back seat to the men's hockey team that was practicing and playing in the same arena. We were always in the background, typical back then.""While the men's Beanpot tournament is now held before near-capacity crowds at TD Garden, the home rink of the Boston Bruins, the women's teams take turns hosting their event. This year's games are being played at Harvard's Bright-Landry Hockey Center, which seats about 2,800. Bertagna said that when the arena was being renovated in the late 1970s, university officials wanted to put the women's hockey team's lockers in an adjoining building that housed an indoor track.Each year, Beanpot participants traditionally receive a gift, and Flint said women's teams were often given a hat, at most.Today, men's and women's teams receive tokens of equal value, usually in the form of gift cards. But while the gifts for the men's teams are paid by TD Garden and tournament receipts, the four universities split the cost of the women's gifts.Bertagna said there was no official alliance between the men's and women's Beanpot committees, although they hold luncheons throughout the year and regularly discuss ideas for both tournaments. One point of conversation has been the request to feature the women's Beanpot final at TD Garden, as the opening of a doubleheader with the men's final.""I think it's the way it should be,"" Harvard Coach Katey Stone said. ""These women work their tails off. They deserve to play in front of great crowds. People would be pleasantly surprised by the product on the ice.""Bertagna said he believed they were earnestly working toward relocating the women's final.""It's not being dismissed out of hand, which I think at one time it might've been,"" he said. ""But anything that has so much tradition, it takes a little time for people to wrap their arms around doing something different after 60-some odd years.""Boston University Coach Brian Durocher noted how each team in the women's Beanpot has Olympians on its roster, but he was frustrated that there might not be enough interest in seeing them play in front of bigger crowds.The 2014 Winter Olympics gold medal game, a 3-2 overtime classic won by Canada over the United States, featured six players who competed in this year's Beanpot. Yet at the start of last Tuesday's opening-round games, only about 200 people were in attendance. Hundreds more arrived throughout the night -- the official attendance was 1,181 -- including a number of girls hockey clubs that received donated tickets.""I know it will never get the recognition that the men's tournament gets, that's just a fact of life,"" Flint said. ""But I think they do a pretty good job with it, promoting it. I've seen the attendance grow.""This year, snow had postponed the men's opening-round games from their traditional slot on the first Monday in February, so the men's and women's Beanpots were played simultaneously. Across town, at TD Garden, 14,520 were in attendance.Nonetheless, Emily Field, a senior forward for Boston College, was impressed by the turnout for the women's games.""On a Tuesday night at five o'clock after a big snowstorm, it's kind of unbelievable,"" she said. ""It wasn't like that a few years ago, and I hope it continues to grow.""There were Northeastern and Boston College fans at the first women's opening-round game who also had tickets to watch the men's teams play later that night. After supporting the men's team earlier in the evening, the Boston University pep band arrived midway through the second period of the women's game, as did a number of Terriers alumni and students.Boston College forward Danielle Doherty, who grew up in nearby Newton, attended the women's Beanpot as a child. The rinks were so empty, she could go up to the end of the boards and slap hands with players she idolized.From her time as a fan to fulfilling a dream of playing in the Beanpot, Doherty said the tournament had grown tangibly and symbolically.""I remember the first trophy: It was on like a little wooden box, and it kind of broke off,"" she said. ""Now we feel a little bit more important with the big metal one.""Photograph Boston College's Alex Carpenter, Top, During the Eagles' 3-1 Win Over Northeastern in the Beanpot Women's Semifinals.

Landslide Near Jade Mine in Myanmar Kills About 100:   [Foreign Desk ],,"YANGON, Myanmar -- A landslide near a jade mine in northern Myanmar on Saturday evening killed about 100 people, most of them villagers digging for green stones in a mountain of displaced earth, a witness and a community leader said Sunday. Many other people were missing.The landslide occurred in the Kachin State area of Hpakant, said Brang Seng, a jade businessman, who watched as bodies were pulled from the debris and taken to a hospital morgue.""People were crying,"" he said. ""I'm hearing that more than 100 people died. In some cases, entire families were lost.""Lamai Gum Ja, a community leader, said that homes at the base of the mine dump had been flattened.He estimated that 100 to 200 people were still missing. Search and rescue teams wearing bright orange uniforms dug through the rubble for survivors on Sunday.Kachin, which is about 600 miles north of Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city, has some of the highest-quality jade in the world.The industry generated an estimated $31 billion last year, with most of the wealth going to individuals and companies tied to Myanmar's former military rulers, according to Global Witness, an advocacy group focused on natural resources.Hpakant, the center of the jade industry, remains very poor, with bumpy dirt roads, constant electricity blackouts and high rates of heroin addiction.After Myanmar's former military rulers handed over power to a nominally civilian government five years ago, resulting in the lifting of many Western sanctions, the already rapid pace of mining turned frenetic. Few scraps of ground or parts of daily life in Hpakant have been untouched by the fleets of giant yellow trucks and backhoes that have sliced apart mountains.In the past year, dozens of small-scale miners have been maimed or killed while picking through tailing dumps.""Large companies, many of them owned by families of former generals, army companies, cronies and drug lords, are making tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year through their plunder of Hpakant,"" said Mike Davis, the Asia director at Global Witness.""Their legacy to local people is a dystopian wasteland in which scores of people at a time are buried alive in landslides,"" Mr. Davis said.",0.0
Height Meets Heft:   [Real Estate Desk ],,"Fueled by a scarcity of land and by demand from multimillionaires willing to pay record prices for helicopter views of Central Park and beyond, Manhattan developers are building ever taller, ever thinner apartment buildings on ever tinier lots. Clustered mostly in and around West 57th Street, these skinny skyscrapers are reaching heights of more than 1,000 feet.One consequence of beanstalk proportions: The higher and slimmer buildings get, the more they tend to sway at the top.On a typically breezy day, a tower 1,000 feet tall might move a couple of inches, according to Rowan Williams Davies and Irwin, consulting engineers. About once a year, a 50-mile-per-hour wind comes up, moving a tower of this size about half a foot. On a rare day, say once every 50 years, 100-mile-per-hour winds might move the tower as much as two feet.While such movement does not present a safety hazard and is often imperceptible, it can make some people woozy. So developers of skinny skyscrapers are installing giant counterweights, or dampening systems, at the apex of their towers to offset building motion. This ballast is not an amenity proclaimed in large type in a glossy brochure -- or one most developers care to talk about. Nevertheless, it is viewed as state-of-the-art assurance for the penthouse-buying set.""It makes sense to do it, because who wants to wear a seasick band when you're at your house?"" joked Brian K. Lewis, an associate broker at Halstead Property, who is representing a buyer in contract at 780-foot-tall 520 Park Avenue, and other buyers considering apartments at the towers One57 on West 57th Street and 432 Park Avenue, which all have dampening systems. ""They're not marketing it,"" he added.Dampening systems are not as alluring a draw as a slick lobby. One type, called a tuned mass damper, is made of steel or concrete, weighs anywhere from 300 to 800 tons and is housed with other mechanical equipment at the top of the building. A typical system can take up approximately 1,000 square feet of space and utilizes a double-height ceiling. Connected to the structure's walls by a system of pistons and spring mounts, the damper acts like a massive shock absorber, pulling the building back toward its original position whenever high winds blow.Another type of damper, known as a slosh damper or slosh tank, uses tons of water instead of steel to add weight to the top of a building.""It's this incredible bit of technology that really gets hidden,"" said Stephen DeSimone, the president of DeSimone Consulting Engineers, which specializes in the design of high-rises. His firm is employing mass dampers to help minimize sway at rising buildings, including Time Equities' 50 West, a 780-foot-tall curved glass condominium in Lower Manhattan, and 100 East 53rd Street, a 710-foot-tall condominium by Vanke, Hines and RFR Holding. ""Nobody knows it's there, standing guard, if you will.""These massive stabilizers are increasingly an integral part of skyscraper design in New York as buildings climb from ever smaller bases. In the last five years, Rowan Williams Davies and Irwin, a Canadian firm, a.k.a R.W.D.I., has worked on nine water-based and 14 mechanical dampers in New York. That's up from just four slosh tanks and three tuned mass dampers between the late 1990s and the last recession.Right now, at least 10 luxury Manhattan apartment buildings under construction plan to install one.Among them: 111 West 57th Street, the 1,428-foot-tall condominium and conversion of the landmark Steinway building undertaken by JDS Development Group and Property Markets Group; 53W53, the 1,050-foot tall apartment house next door to the Museum of Modern Art, by Hines, Goldman Sachs and the Pontiac Land Group of Singapore; Vornado Realty Trust's 950-foot-tall limestone tower at 220 Central Park South; and 111 Murray Street, a 792-foot-tall curved glass condominium by Fisher Brothers, Witkoff and New Valley, on the edge of TriBeCa.Then there's 432 Park Avenue, a venture of CIM Group and Macklowe Properties, which topped out last year at 1,396 feet and holds the title for the tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere. It has two tuned mass dampers.Dampening systems are not required by the New York City building code, and structural engineers emphasize that this equipment has nothing to do with the integrity of the building.""It's purely about comfort,"" said Silvian Marcus, a director of building structures for WSP, an international engineering consultancy. ""It's related to money and how luxurious the place is.""Builders put skyscrapers through all kinds of tests to make sure they will perform well in every conceivable weather condition. Scale models are placed in wind tunnel machines that simulate extreme winds. Based on the results, changes can be made in the design, like shoring up the building with thicker walls and columns.The terra-cotta panels and bronze latticework on the east and west facades of 111 West 57th, for example, were designed partly to reduce the wind forces on the building.Granted, all skyscrapers sway to some degree. And most of the time that movement is so slight it is imperceptible. But with tuned mass dampers costing relatively little -- roughly $5 million, not much in the scheme of things, with penthouses selling for as much as $100 million -- it's worth the investment for developers to ensure that the buyers of their apartments rarely, if ever, have any reason to consider wind speed.""Unless you're a supersensitive person, you're probably not going to feel it,"" said Izak Senbahar, a developer of 56 Leonard, an 821-foot TriBeCa tower that is to have a water-based damper. ""But if you're building a luxury apartment, you have to think about the comfort of every buyer."" In that sense, he said, ""I think it's a must.""Most of the developers contacted for this article were not willing to discuss the dampers going into their buildings. If they were concerned that doing so might incite jitters among potential penthouse buyers, they wouldn't say.Mr. Senbahar, one of two developers who returned calls by deadline, likened the system to any other building amenity. ""Your marketing people may not think a damper is sexy,"" he said, pointing out that marketers tend to be more excited about features like dog spas than building engineering. ""I was joking,"" he added, ""but a damper and a dog-grooming station are just two amenities of a building.""Another developer not shy about discussing building sway was Simon Koster, a principal of JDS Development Group, which with the Property Markets Group is building 111 West 57th Street. With a 60-foot-wide tower, the 1,428-foot condominium is perhaps the slimmest of them all. Designed by SHoP Architects, it will have an 800-ton tuned mass damper.""Is the building structurally sound without the damper? The answer is absolutely,"" Mr. Koster said. ""All buildings move. It's about tailoring that movement"" for the comfort of the occupants.Engineers have no problems talking about dampers, enthusing about aspect ratios, milli-g's and other measurements that go into their design. They point out that it is not so much the actual displacement of a building that is pertinent, but rather the acceleration and deceleration of the building's sway when winds kick up.""When you're in a car, you may be going 60 miles per hour and you don't feel it,"" said Eli Gottlieb, a senior principal of Thornton Tomasetti, a New York engineering firm that is working on at least three Manhattan buildings that will have dampers. ""But every time the car accelerates or decelerates or changes lanes, you feel the start and stop.""That sensation is acceptable in a moving vehicle partly because it's expected, engineers say. In a building, however, people don't anticipate that the floor will move. ""It's your home,"" said Mr. Marcus of WSP. ""Imagine you start eating and you see the wine in your glass going left to right.""While slosh-inducing storms are rare, a damper would slow the acceleration, measured in milli-g's, by up to 50 percent, according to R.W.D.I. The perception of motion, therefore, would also be reduced.To give developers an idea of what those milli-g's actually feel like, R.W.D.I. has teamed up with the Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland. There, a simulator designed to replicate the movement of oceangoing vessels in rough seas for mariner training offers a virtual reality experience of building sway in blustery weather.The simulator, usually outfitted to look like the bridge of a ship, is decorated with furniture when a developer is the client, including a couch, a chandelier and wine glasses filled with water. Instead of rocky seas, city views are projected on the walls. While clients sit, stand or lean against a kitchen counter as they might at home, ""we take it through the full range,"" with and without a damper, said Jon Galsworthy, a principal of R.W.D.I.The developers get an idea of what they might expect to feel without a damper on, say, a windy day in the spring, during a big nor'easter, or when a hurricane hits. ""It makes it very, very real and leaves a very distinct impression,"" he said.So what exactly does it feel like? ""You get a little dizzy and a little disoriented,"" said Maria Halfyard, a manager of the Center for Marine Simulation at the Fisheries and Marine Institute. ""You're like, whoa, this is weird. I'm in a building and I'm moving and I feel like I'm getting motion sick.""But those who have lived in high places say the sway can also be exciting. ""I actually thought it was really cool,"" said Christopher Meloni, the actor, who lived with his family on the 60th floor of the Park Imperial in Midtown Manhattan for several years until moving to Los Angeles a couple years ago.Even though the Park Imperial has a dampening system, Mr. Meloni said he ""would feel the sensation and then I would look to my right and I'd see the buildings next door moving back and forth through my framed window and go, 'O.K., I'm not crazy.'""To me, the joy about living that high is the weather phenomenon,"" he added. ""Sometimes you're fogged in and so you feel, 'here I am flying through the clouds.' You'll see the storm fronts coming from over New Jersey and over the middle of the Hudson. It always was very, very exciting.""Mr. Meloni's apartment is on the market for $8.95 million. With its high-floor panoramic views, said Mr. Lewis, the listing broker of Halstead Property, it is ""attracting strong interest.""Photograph Among the Tall and Skinny Buildings in Manhattan with Dampening Systems Are, Clockwise From Above: 50 West Street (Center of Frame); 111 West 57th Street; 432 Park Avenue (to the Right of the Empire State Building, Which Predates the Technology); and 53 West 53rd Street.

Tied State House Race in Mississippi Is Decided by a Straw:   [National Desk ],,"JACKSON, Miss. -- Sometimes American politics is about ideas, powered by Jeffersons and Adamses and Reagans. Sometimes it is about strategy, with races determined by the chess-match machinations of Axelrods and Roves.But every once in a while, the fate of governments is determined by a considerably less eminent character, one usually found lurking in back-alley craps games and on the Vegas strip: Lady Luck.In Mississippi on Friday, luck smiled on a Democratic state representative, Blaine Eaton II, who had been forced, by state law, to draw straws for his seat after his race for re-election ended in a tie. On Friday afternoon, in a short, strange ceremony here presided over by Gov. Phil Bryant and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, Mr. Eaton and his Republican challenger, Mark Tullos, each removed a silver box from a bag. Mr. Eaton opened his box to reveal a long green straw.And with that, a mathematically improbable tie for the House District 79 seat -- each candidate had received exactly 4,589 votes -- had been broken, though not by the voters.Moments after winning, Mr. Eaton, who raises cattle and grows timber and soybeans, attributed his win to a farmer's luck. ""There's always happiness in a good crop year,"" he said.A lawyer for Mr. Tullos said that a challenge had been filed with the State House of Representatives. Mr. Tullos, a lawyer himself, declined to comment but had said he planned a challenge if he lost the draw. He had cited concerns about the way a county election board handled nine paper ""affidavit ballots"" filed by voters who believed their names were erroneously left off the voter rolls.Resorting to a game of chance to break an electoral tie is common in many states, and coin tosses are often used to settle smaller local races. But in few instances had the pot been as rich as this: If Mr. Tullos had won, his fellow Republicans would have gained a three-fifths supermajority in the State House of Representatives, the threshold required to pass revenue-related bills.At stake, potentially, was hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue. The three-fifths requirement has allowed the Democratic minority to block Republican tax-cut proposals in the past on the grounds that Mississippi needs the revenue to finance schools and other services. Republicans, who also control the State Senate and governor's mansion, say the cuts, including a proposal to phase out the state's corporate franchise tax, will jump-start the economy and promote job growth.District 79 is a rural chunk of farmland and piney woods about an hour's drive east of Jackson. Mr. Eaton, 48, had not threatened a challenge if he lost, but, like his opponent, was not happy with the way the race was decided.""It's wrong -- philosophically, morally,"" Mr. Eaton said before Friday's drawing. ""It's archaic, it's medieval, and it's wrong. We need a new election."" He repeated the sentiment even after winning and said that he hoped to co-author a bill to change the law that settles some elections by the drawing of lots.The mere fact that the election came to this is one of a long string of disappointments for Southern Democrats, who once ran the region as a virtual one-party zone but whose power has collapsed in recent years. In every state south of Virginia, Republicans control the governor's mansion and both chambers of the legislature. In 2011, Mississippi Republicans won a majority in the State House for the first time since Reconstruction, and increased their numbers in voting this month. If Mr. Tullos had won, he would have been the 74th Republican in the House out of a total of 122 seats.Mr. Eaton, a gregarious and proudly homespun man, met a reporter Wednesday morning at the Huddle House in his hometown, Taylorsville, and tried to make light of the forces of history, and perhaps fate, that appear to be arrayed against him.""If I lose the coin toss, it's going to be kind of like that Hank Williams Jr. song, 'Dinosaur,""' he said, and he recited a few lyrics: ""I should've died a long time before,"" he said.Another line: ""Excuse me, man, but where's the door?""If nothing else, the drawing of straws was a fittingly civilized conclusion to a race that was run with exceeding small-town politesse. The men know each other, and both are well known among the voters in District 79, which encompasses Smith County and part of Jasper County.""I told Bo's wife when I qualified that she'd never hear a bad thing come out of my mouth about her, or her husband, or her family,"" Mr. Tullos said.Mr. Eaton has served in the House for 19 years, occupying a seat formerly held by his grandfather, a pine-belt populist who was also named Blaine Eaton and was known as ""the silver-tongued orator of Sullivan's Hollow.""There were no debates in the contest. Mr. Eaton passed out fliers noting his Southern Baptist church membership and a ""Highest"" rating from the National Rifle Association. In person, he spoke passionately about the need to resist corporate tax cuts, and to expand Medicaid under President Obama's health care law, an idea rejected by Mr. Bryant.After the tie, Mr. Eaton originally said that he hoped to call a special session and change the law. Later, though, he resigned himself to the outcome of Friday's draw.""Look, my life's a gamble,"" he said. ""I'm a farmer. I depend on the weather and the rain. The statute's clear, but my life is not.""Mr. Tullos's law practice is about 20 minutes up the road in the county seat of Raleigh, a small town where many things -- a small park, offices, a dental clinic -- conspicuously bear his family name. He said he went door to door with a campaign that did not emphasize Republican Party talking points so much as a promise to bring more business to the area.Smith County, he said, lacks a retailer where one can buy a decent pair of shoes. ""I want to go to Jackson, and whenever they start talking about economic development, I want to hold up my hand and say, what about this district?"" Mr. Tullos, 51, said before Friday's drawing.Some Democrats wondered whether the Republican-controlled House would be able to impartially judge the matter. On Thursday, Greg Snowden, the Republican House speaker pro tempore, predicted that ""every member of the House will treat this with the utmost seriousness.""""It's not a game,"" he said.Photograph From Left, Gov.

"Gun Violence Leveling Off in New York, Data Show:   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"Despite a wild burst of gunfire that wounded nine people at a party in Brooklyn over the weekend, the number of shootings across New York City was sharply lower last week compared with the same week in 2014, bringing the city effectively even with last year in total amount of gunfire.Through Sunday, there had been 669 shooting episodes reported citywide in 2015 versus 674 at this time last year, Police Department statistics show. Those shootings resulted in 794 people struck by bullets -- virtually the same number at this point last year, when 787 had been struck. The number from this year includes the nine hit, none fatally, at the party in the East New York neighborhood on Sunday.The numbers are a sharp contrast to two months ago, when police commanders noted a rise in shootings and began to flood the most violent precincts with extra officers.Chief James P. O'Neill, the department's highest-ranking uniformed officer, said in June that gun violence was ""our focus"" and pledged to reverse the trend, beginning a summer antiviolence initiative one month early and extending overtime to keep more officers on the streets during high-crime weekend hours.The summer often brings surges in violence. But since early June, shootings have fallen, even as the number of homicides in the city remains 10 percent higher than the historic low from last year -- 196 murders recorded by the police compared with 178 at this point in 2014, according to the preliminary statistics. Three people were killed in gunfire over the weekend.""Having more cops on the street helps, but you can't have cops everywhere,"" said Stephen Davis, the department's top spokesman. ""What we have been doing is targeting some of these groups. Hopefully by targeting the right people, who drive the violence, we reduce the violence.""As an example, Mr. Davis pointed to three separate takedowns last week in the Bronx and Upper Manhattan that resulted in dozens of arrests in connection with shootings and drug sales.The specter of rising violent crime has been an issue for Mayor Bill de Blasio since he took office last year pledging to reform police practices while keeping the streets safe. The level of gunplay remains higher this year than it was in 2013, when shootings hit new lows. But the trend in violence, by the end of July, appears to have flattened out, according to police statistics.""We are the safest big city in America,"" Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a news conference on July 15 when shooting numbers began showing improvement. ""We will continue to be. We will, in fact, go farther.""Policing experts caution against reading too much into the weekly fluctuations in crime data. For example, the final week of July was a particularly bloody one in 2014, with the police recording 40 shootings and 47 people hit. By comparison, last week, a period of relative calm, there were just 18 recorded episodes of gunfire, according to the preliminary statistics.Those episodes included an unusually large number of people struck, 33, including at the backyard party in Brooklyn, where at least two gunmen opened fire, and at a playground in the Bronx, where three people were hit by gunfire early on Sunday. No arrests had been made in either case by late Monday.",0.0
The Logic of an Empty $100 Million Pad:   [SpecialSections ],,"For most investors, a diversified portfolio means a prudent mix of stocks and bonds. For the global elite, diversification increasingly means splurging on New York apartments that can cost tens of millions of dollars, or more.Across Manhattan, real estate developers are scrambling to meet surging demand from buyers around the world who are prepared to pay record-setting prices for new developments with opulent finishes and extraordinary views.These buyers -- some of whom obscure their identities through webs of shell companies-- are not all rushing to call the Big Apple home. Instead, many of them are paying record prices with the expectation that their investments will appreciate, even as they sit empty for most of the year.Last month, the buying frenzy reached new extremes, with one apartment changing hands for more than $100 million.""We've become a global piggy bank,"" said Kirk Henckels, vice chairman of Stribling & Associates.Yet at the upper echelons of the property market, the lines between prudent investing and splashy one-upmanship are inherently blurred.""When you're talking about a bank account that big, diversification is a basic rule of economics and investment,"" Mr. Henckels said. ""It's a wonderful way to justify investing in your toys.""Head-scratching prices aside, New York real estate has proved to be a durable, even lucrative long-term investment. Residential property in Manhattan appreciated 26 percent over the last five years, according to data from the Corcoran Group.That's not bad. But compared to stocks, which have rebounded sharply since the financial crisis, it is subpar. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up more than 75 percent over the same period.Among certain New York properties, though, the appreciation was more striking. New development, which accounts for many of the priciest sales in the city, is up 52 percent over the last five years, Corcoran says. And at the highest end of the market, returns outperformed almost all other asset classes. In 2013, properties that changed hands for more than $9.5 million gave their sellers an average 32 percent profit, according to StreetEasy.""When you study the values of New York real estate, whether it's five or 10 or 20 years, the story says buy,"" said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group.A major factor feeding the sudden buying binge is a flood of new properties that cater to the top tier of global buyers.Half a dozen residential skyscrapers are sprouting in Midtown Manhattan, each promising views, amenities and materials fit for kings and queens.One57, the first completed, has sold most of its units, including the city's first $100 million apartment. Further east, the gridlike facade of 432 Park Avenue already looms over Midtown, its perfectly square windows making it the city's newest architectural statement. Both buildings offer full-floor palaces high in the sky.""Years ago we didn't have these kinds of properties,"" Ms. Liebman said. ""But savvy developers realized that if you build it, they will come.""Even more new residential skyscrapers will soon cast long shadows over the city. The skinniest of the bunch will be erected above the Steinway piano building on West 57th Street, in what has become known as Billionaires' Row.Nearby, a tower next to the Museum of Modern Art, designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel, is on the road to construction. So is 220 Central Park South, a limestone spire designed by Robert A. M. Stern. Around the city, other projects will compete for attention and dollars.It's not that the city lacked inventory. It has the most expensive real estate market in the country, with thousands of multimillion-dollar apartments, townhouses and mansions changing hands regularly.But as tastes changed, apartments that once appeared palatial now seem pedestrian. Today's new construction includes floor-to-ceiling windows, full-floor residences, opulent finishes and amenities like room service from Michelin-starred chefs.""For the superwealthy who are used to five- or six-star hotel services around the world, it's a really great way to not just travel now, but to live,"" Ms. Liebman said.Putting a price on such trophy properties is no science. ""Art is a closer analogy than stocks or bonds,"" said Christopher J. Mayer, a real estate professor at Columbia University. ""What matters is the amount of this stuff available and the number of people looking at it.""And to explain why buyers will pay such soaring prices, brokers often resort to metaphors, not mathematics.""How else do you explain $10,000 a square foot?"" said Mr. Henckels at Stribling & Associates. ""It's the same thing with the price for carats of a pink diamond or square inches of a Warhol.""At least one buyer appears to believe that his new residence is an actual work of art. William A. Ackman, the hedge fund manager who bought a penthouse at One57 as an investment that he plans to keep empty save for the occasional event, called his $90 million party pad ""the Mona Lisa of apartments.""However, the Mona Lisa is one of the most reproduced artworks in the world. And as more such towers rise around Manhattan, the views and floor plans for which Mr. Ackman and others are paying top dollar may not be unique.""There's more space on Park Avenue than there are billionaires who want to live in New York,"" Mr. Mayer said. ""Unlike Picassos, there is not a finite number of these properties.""Even Ms. Liebman, whose company represents sponsors of several new buildings, acknowledges that the market is becoming crowded. ""There will be winners and losers,"" Ms. Liebman said. ""Some buildings are better than others. Savvy buyers will play the buildings against each other.""For now, however, demand is not ebbing. Foreign buyers continue to view New York real estate as a safe place to park money, keeping inventory tight and demand high.""We have the greatest influx of foreign buyers that we've ever seen,"" Ms. Liebman said. ""The Chinese have made a huge impact on New York real estate along with Latin, European, Russian buyers. The past year has brought us a lot of Middle Eastern buyers.""For these buyers -- oligarchs, international corporate chieftains and foreign royalty -- who make up an estimated 30 to 50 percent of high-end buyers, there are various allures to Manhattan property.""It's a repository of money, it's in the dollar currency, and it's in New York City,"" said Gary Barnett, president of Extell Development Company, whose projects include One57.Currency fluctuations, unpredictable world affairs and unstable governments contribute to the desire for a safe haven.""It can be a good idea to have money outside your home markets,"" Mr. Henckels said. ""Hardly any of these people are actually New York City residents.""Yet a market reliant on a small cadre of the world's richest men and women can also be fragile. ""A 50 percent drop in the price of oil is a huge risk,"" said Mr. Mayer of Columbia. ""A significant number of the world's billionaires rely on oil.""Believers in the ever-rising tide of property values point to a notable resale at One57. Last May, a Chicago-based investor bought a three-bedroom apartment for $30.6 million. In October, the unit was sold to a hedge fund manager for $34 million. That quick profit -- an appreciation of 11 percent in less than half a year -- made it one of the better investments of 2014. ""The perception is that if you're getting in on Day 1, you're almost guaranteed to see price increases,"" Ms. Liebman said.But the higher the price, the more elusive the potential returns. If an apartment sold for $100 million today were to enjoy the same appreciation as the first resale at One57, it would trade hands for $111 million later this year. ""I'm skeptical from here about how much appreciation there can be,"" Mr. Mayer said.And with so many other trophy properties coming to market, it is unclear if Mr. Ackman or others like him will be able to find a buyer soon.""I am concerned,"" Mr. Henckels said. ""The biggest question is, have we overbuilt luxury inventory, and I don't know the answer.""Of course, this is not the first time that speculators have bet on Manhattan property or that critics have grumbled about a bubble. In the years before the financial crisis, two marquee properties hit the market and broke records. New construction at 15 Central Park West attracted prominent buyers looking for pristine new construction. And condominium conversions at the Plaza Hotel overlooking Central Park proved alluring to moneyed buyers looking for a piece of old New York.At the time, critics thought buyers were overpaying and prices would never go higher. But over the last eight years, prices in those buildings have continued to rise. ""Look at the profits people have made there,"" Mr. Henckels said.At a certain point, however, logic fails to explain what are ultimately emotional decisions, and real estate experts again turn to the art world for explanations. ""These guys will buy a $50 million to $100 million painting and put it on their wall,"" Mr. Barnett said. ""Or you can buy a $50- to $100-million piece of real estate that is probably more unique, and no one can steal it from you. Some people actually think that way.""Photograph Lofty Living: Two of the New Residential Skyscrapers in New York Provide Striking Views.

Stacking Bricks and Stones to the Sky in a City of Glass Towers:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"A neat little row of bricks and stone blocks sits on a worktable inside the TriBeCa offices of the development firm DDG. Some are classic red, others ivory white; a few resemble smoke, a ghost of their birth in the kiln.""Each brick has a fingerprint,"" said Joe McMillan, chief executive and co-founder of the six-year-old firm.He was not being poetic, at least not entirely. On the top of each 21-inch brick is a pair of thumbprints, a reminder that each one was pressed from a wooden mold by an actual person in Broager, a small seaside town in Denmark where the bricks have been made in this fashion by the Petersen brick company since 1791.""The crazy thing is, no one is ever even going to see that print once it's been set,"" Mr. McMillan said. ""But just knowing they are there, it gives you a sense of how much care went into each brick.""And by hand-laying those bricks -- a nearly lost art -- DDG hopes to show how much care goes into each of its buildings.With everything growing slick, streamlined and interconnected the past few decades, both in construction and in life, DDG's zeal for mortared joints happened almost by coincidence, more through a bond with craft than a love of bricks. Yet the attraction has been just as strong for luxury buyers who want everything in life to be tailored.Whether it is a boutique TriBeCa loft building that looks as if it pushed its way out of the earth or a 521-foot tower with nearly 600,000 hand-laid bricks on the Upper East Side, DDG has a way with mortar that is at once contemporary and recalls the earliest days of cities, which masonry made possible.""I think we're finally over the stripped-down modernist boxes, and we're searching for something with more intrinsic values,"" Peter Guthrie, DDG's head of design and construction, said. (Unlike most developers, the firm does both in-house, part of the reason its work can be so exacting.)He and Mr. McMillan could spend hours talking about bricks, discussing and dissecting them the way some people do wine or literature. The patina, the heft, the hue, the character, even the philosophy of construction are popular topics around the office.This may sound strange, but it is doubly so given how most brick buildings are assembled these days, whether a four-story townhouse or a 40-story tower.After the great fire of 1835, New York mandated that all buildings be made from noncombustible materials. Suddenly the clay-lined shores of the Hudson Valley became a gold mine. ""It became one of the greatest brick industries known to man, almost all of it feeding the growth of New York,"" said Richard Pieper, director of preservation at Jan Hird Pokorny Associates, an architecture firm specializing in historic restoration work.For more than a century, there was an explosion of red brick, brownstone, terra cotta and limestone construction around the region. Even once skyscrapers started rising on their iron and steel frames, bricks played an important role -- the Empire State Building, though clad in stone, has more than 10 million bricks invisibly lining its structure as fireproofing.After World War II, companies like Alcoa and United States Steel looked for ways to put their factories to use building things other than tanks and planes, which spurred aluminum panels and glass curtain walls. Yet New York resisted the modernist urge for some time, at least for residential buildings.After all, the great prewar architects Rosario Candela, J.E.R. Carpenter and Emery Roth had divined the concept of the apartment house, ushering in high-rise living with their great piles of limestone and brick lining Central Park and Park Avenue. The midcentury mode was seen in the white brick behemoth of Manhattan House on East 66th Street and its myriad imitators. But then Richard Meier's glass towers on Perry Street seemed to change that forever.""It just took over in the 2000s,"" Carol Willis, director of the Skyscraper Museum, said of the boom in crystalline construction. ""Somehow glass came to symbolize luxury and first-class construction, even if that wasn't always the case.""Even when developers still use bricks, they have all but abandoned bricklaying in favor of what is known as ""panelization."" Inside factories across the Midwest and China, bricks or stone blocks are arranged into panels many feet or stories in dimension. They are then shipped to the site and hoisted into place, often exposing seams. Panels are even used in modern masonry marvels like 15 Central Park West.Into this void stepped DDG in 2009. The firm's first project was 41 Bond Street, on the blockbuster block of NoHo already home to the work of Herzog & de Meuron, Deborah Berke and BKSK.Given the neighborhood's fabric of cobblestones and Romanesque Revival loft buildings -- and the fact that it was a landmark district -- the firm decided that a hand-laid facade would be most fitting. Rather than brick, though, it settled on slender, undulating bluestone blocks. A local material more common in Brooklyn sidewalks, here it got a modern treatment with deeply grooved window frames. (As with all their projects, the masonry is not structural, but merely decorative, and largely made possible by the firm's employing its own masons.)Two years later, the firm turned to the Danish bricks for an 11-story project on 14th Street just off Ninth Avenue, on the border of the meatpacking district. The zippered corners and mottled coloration of the white bricks could have been achieved with panels, but it would have shown not only on the outside, but also within, given the deeply recessed windows. It is for that same reason DDG will lay all those bricks on the Upper East Side, at the corner of Third Avenue and 88th Street -- 593,989 to be exact, by Mr. McMillan's calculation.""We considered doing panels after the first hundred feet or so, because you'd think you couldn't tell,"" he said. ""But you know where you could? From inside the apartments.""On a newly proposed project on Franklin Street in TriBeCa, DDG tried to branch out with a mostly glass facade with brick accents. The property is in a historic district, though, and the community board was emphatic, so back came the bricks, though again with modern flourishes, in this case subtle perforations in the pattern.At 12 Warren Street, a 13-unit development that is the firm's latest, the designers turned again to bluestone. No two blocks are the same, and while most are a foot or two long, some are the size of small boulders and weigh many tons. All the pieces were arranged in a yard, tagged, and then put into place in the city.Passers-by could be forgiven for thinking they had always been there.",0.0

"Biden Is Taking Steps Toward '16, Supporters Say:   [National Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDED. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his associates have begun to actively explore a possible presidential campaign, which would upend the Democratic field and deliver a direct threat to Hillary Rodham Clinton, several people who have spoken to Mr. Biden or his closest advisers say.Mr. Biden's advisers have started to reach out to Democratic leaders and donors who have not yet committed to Mrs. Clinton or who have grown concerned about what they see as her increasingly visible vulnerabilities as a candidate.The conversations, often fielded by Mr. Biden's chief of staff, Steve Ricchetti, have taken place through hushed phone calls and quiet lunches. In most cases, they have grown out of an outpouring of sympathy for Mr. Biden since the death of his son Beau, 46, in May.On Saturday, the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd reported that Mr. Biden had been holding meetings at his residence, ""talking to friends, family and donors about jumping in"" to challenge Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two nominating states.One longtime Biden supporter said the vice president had been deeply moved by his son's desire for him to run.""He was so close to Beau and it was so heartbreaking that, frankly, I thought initially he wouldn't have the heart,"" the supporter, Michael Thornton, a Boston lawyer, said in an interview. ""But I've had indications that maybe he does want to -- and 'that's what Beau would have wanted me to do.' ""Mr. Biden's path, should he run, would not be easy. Mrs. Clinton has enormous support among Democrats inspired by the idea of electing a woman as president, and her campaign has already raised millions of dollars.Additionally, Mr. Biden, who is 72, has in the past proved to be prone to embarrassing gaffes on the campaign trail. He would also face the critical task of building a field operation.One Democrat with direct knowledge of the conversations described the outreach as a heady combination of donors and friends of Mr. Biden's wanting to prop him up in his darkest hours, and of recent polls showing Mrs. Clinton's support among independents declining, suggesting there could be a path to the nomination for the vice president.Ms. Dowd reported that as Beau Biden faced brain cancer, he ""tried to make his father promise to run, arguing that the White House should not revert to the Clintons and that the country would be better off with Biden values."" Mr. Biden's other son, Hunter, also encouraged him to run, she wrote.The support Mr. Biden has garnered speaks to growing concerns among Democrats that Mrs. Clinton could lose in Iowa and New Hampshire, as the populist message of one of her opponents, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, draws swelling crowds.""The reality is it's going to be a tough, even-steven kind of race, and there's that moment when a lot of party establishment would start exactly this kind of rumble: 'Is there anybody else?' "" said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist.At the same time, the slow trickle of news about Mrs. Clinton's use of private email when she was secretary of state, and the coming Benghazi hearings, may be distracting some voters from the core message of her campaign: the need to lift the middle class.""It's not that we dislike Hillary, it's that we want to win the White House,"" said Richard A. Harpootlian, a lawyer and Democratic donor in Columbia, S.C., who met with Mr. Ricchetti before Beau Biden died. ""We have a better chance of doing that with somebody who is not going to have all the distractions of a Clinton campaign.""A spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign declined to comment.In a July 30 Quinnipiac poll, 57 percent of voters said Mrs. Clinton was not honest and trustworthy, and 52 percent said she did not care about their needs or problems. The same poll showed Mr. Biden with his highest favorability rating, 49 percent, in seven years, with 58 percent saying he was honest and trustworthy and 57 percent saying he cared about them. But Mrs. Clinton's numbers are still strong, especially among likely Democratic primary voters.""The No. 1 thing voters want is a candidate who is honest and trustworthy, and the veep is leading in those polls,"" said William Pierce, executive director of Draft Biden, a ""super PAC"" that is trying to build enthusiasm for a possible candidacy.Mr. Biden could still decide not to run. Confidants say they expect him to make something official by early September. Other than by not ruling out a run, and by holding preliminary meetings, he has not openly fueled speculation about his candidacy. As of Saturday, he had no trips planned to Iowa or New Hampshire in the coming weeks. But an intermediary recruited by the vice president's office has been in touch with potential staff members who have not yet signed on to the Clinton campaign.Kendra Barkoff, a Biden spokeswoman, said, ""As the Biden family continues to go through this difficult time, the vice president is focused on his family and immersed in his work.""A 2016 run would be the third time Mr. Biden, a longtime senator from Delaware, had sought the presidency, which friends say is his ultimate dream.Mr. Biden's first campaign in 1988 ended in heartbreak after news reports that he plagiarized parts of a speech and exaggerated his academic record forced him to drop out. In 2008, he drew less than 1 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses and dropped out after making controversial comments about Barack Obama, then seeking his first term in the White House. Mr. Biden said he was ""the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean.""Mr. Obama later chose Mr. Biden as his running mate. In the early months of the 2016 campaign, the president has been careful not to undermine or wholeheartedly endorse either his former secretary of state or his vice president.""The president has said that the best political decision he's ever made in his career has been to ask Joe Biden to run as his vice president,"" Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, said last week.Friends described Mr. Biden's relationship with Mrs. Clinton in the Senate as cordial and warm. But in his long career in Democratic politics, Mr. Biden has clashed with former President Bill Clinton, and his relationship with Mrs. Clinton has not been without awkwardness. One close Biden confidant, Ron Klain, has been in contact with Mrs. Clinton's campaign about helping her prepare for the Democratic debates, a sign some people interpreted as evidence that Mr. Biden would decide against a run.Mr. Ricchetti, a White House aide in the Clinton administration who is now Mr. Biden's chief of staff, began talking to donors and supporters in the months before Beau Biden died.In recent weeks, those talks, with local elected officials and party leaders, started again, mostly because well-wishers were calling to check on the Biden family. The talk inevitably drifted to 2016, and many of these Democrats urged Mr. Biden to seriously consider getting into the race, said people with knowledge of the talks who agreed to discuss private conversations only anonymously.Mr. Ricchetti declined to comment.The speculation intensified on Thursday when friends of Mrs. Clinton's spotted Mr. Ricchetti having breakfast at the Four Seasons in Washington with Louis B. Susman, a major donor and former ambassador to Britain. Fox News reported on the meeting.Mr. Susman -- who has already made the maximum donation allowed in the primary, $2,700, to Mrs. Clinton's campaign, and who is a longtime friend of the Biden family -- dismissed any implication that he was discussing the vice president's plans. ""He wasn't testing the waters with me,"" Mr. Susman said of Mr. Ricchetti. ""There was never any discussion of the presidential campaign or money.""Mr. Biden is by no means a virtuoso campaigner. But his entry into the race would add an unbridled, often unscripted passion for the presidency that some Democrats say the ever-cautious Mrs. Clinton at times lacks.One Democratic donor with direct knowledge of the overtures from the Biden camp said Mr. Biden had already thought about how he would position himself in the race, delivering an economic message to the left of Mrs. Clinton's while embracing Obama administration policies, like health care reform, that are widely popular among Democrats.Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.",0.0
Niger Adds Its Troops to the War on Boko Haram:   [Foreign Desk ],,"DAKAR, Senegal -- With the regional war against the Boko Haram militant group widening, Niger's Parliament has agreed to send troops across the border to join the fight.The vote was unanimous in the National Assembly on Monday night, reflecting the shock produced by at least four attacks in Niger in less than a week, including an explosion at a market in the country's east that killed a number of civilians.Chad, Cameroon and Benin have also agreed to contribute troops to an 8,700-member force to fight Boko Haram. Attacks by the militant group, which is based in Nigeria, have increasingly spilled across borders in the region.Nigeria's war has spread to its smaller, poorer neighbor, Niger. In Diffa, the main city in the country's far east, just across the border from Nigeria, ""people are in a panic,"" the head of the Red Cross in Diffa, Abdullai Adah, said by phone on Tuesday, after a bombing at a vegetable market and an attack on the city's prison the day before. At least eight were killed, Mr. Adah said.""Everybody is shut up at home,"" he said. ""All the stores are closed. And we are hearing heavy artillery from the Nigeria side.""The civil prison in Diffa that Boko Haram struck held militants and their sympathizers, according to a regional news site, Sahelien.com. The site quoted residents as saying that they had heard armed men calling ""Allahu akbar"" from pickup trucks as the prison was attacked -- a cry that also resounds from three newly released Boko Haram propaganda videos this week.The National Assembly's vote in Niger's capital, Niamey, 850 miles away, followed the attacks in Diffa within hours.""People are worried,"" said a leading political scientist in the capital, Mahaman Tidjani Alou.""That there are bombs in Niger, this is something totally unprecedented,"" said Mr. Alou, speaking by phone on Tuesday. ""It's clear that this is not just at our doorstep now. It is inside the country.""Niger, a country where American and French drones are based, has been attacked previously by Al Qaeda's African affiliate in its desert north. It now finds itself under attack on its southern edge by a different group of Islamist extremists.""Niger has had a very clear position in relation to Boko Haram, and it is equally clear that this position can have consequences,"" Mr. Alou said. ""It's the state itself that has been attacked, the symbols of authority. The state can't simply allow that.""Diffa, only about 100 miles from the Nigerian city that spawned Boko Haram, Maiduguri, was penetrated as long ago as the early 2000s by the radical Islamist ideology on which the sect was nurtured, a French specialist on Boko Haram, Marc-Antoine Pérouse de Montclos, said in a new study.Extremist preachers struggled for influence in the city before being chased from Diffa's central mosque in 2007, Mr. de Montclos wrote. Yet the dusty, low-slung market town was thought by specialists to have been penetrated by Boko Haram cells and to have provided a safe haven for the militants even as they were attacking Nigerians across the border.As the vote wrapped up in Niamey late Monday night, the National Assembly speaker, Amadou Salifou, said there had been a ""collective recognition of the gravity of the situation,"" according to the state news service.With attacks on Boko Haram now coming from the militaries of four countries -- Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria -- the group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, released a video this week on YouTube in which he mocked the forces arrayed against him, especially Chad's.""You sent 7,000 of your soldiers. Why didn't you send seven million?"" he said in the video, according to a translation by the terrorism monitoring group SITE. ""Only 7,000? By Allah, it is small. We can capture them in an attempt or two.""",0.0

The N.F.L. Suspension That Started Them All:   [Sports Desk ],,"In 1925, four high school students, recruited by a star athlete, tried to blend in as professional players during an N.F.L. game in Chicago.The students were, in the end, noticed -- resulting in what is believed to be the N.F.L.'s first suspension. And coming 90 years before the New England Patriots' ball-inflation scandal, that case involving the high school ringers set a precedent for all peculiar N.F.L. scandals and suspensions to come.N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell last week upheld Tom Brady's four-game suspension for his role in the Patriots' use of underinflated footballs in the A.F.C. championship game last season, eliciting much discussion on how the league metes out justice for its players.But in 1925, five years after the league was founded as the American Professional Football Association, a four-game sentence would have seemed lenient.Art Folz, a player for the Chicago Cardinals, was initially barred from the league for life for persuading the four high school players -- Charles Richardson, William Thompson, Jack Daniels and James Snyder -- to play on an opposing team for one game. Ambrose McGuirk, the owner of that team, the Milwaukee Badgers, was forced to sell the franchise in the wake of the incident.In 1925, the Cardinals were in a tight race for first place with the Pottsville Maroons, and to pad their record, the owner Chris O'Brien organized a game for Dec. 10 at Normal Park against Milwaukee, which was 0-6 that year. In the early years of the N.F.L., teams could add to their schedules up until late December, and O'Brien exercised that right.But O'Brien was concerned that the Badgers, who had already disbanded for the season, would not be able to scrap together enough players.""The next day or so I remarked: 'I wonder if McGuirk will come through with a team all right,' "" he wrote in The Chicago Daily Tribune on Dec. 17, 1925, in an explanation that appeared on the front page of the sports section under the banner headline ""Pros Tell Full Story of Prep Scandal.""""That remark was overheard by one of my players, Art Folz. He said perhaps he could pick up some players if extras were needed.""Folz -- described by the sportswriter Robert Pruter as ""one of the most talented quarterbacks ever produced by the city"" -- initially thought of asking two of his former Englewood High School teammates who had been playing professionally in Chicago.""Never once did I think of going to high school players,"" Folz wrote in The Tribune.But two days before the game, he did just that: After he was unable to meet with the professional players, Folz wrote, he ""just happened to drop into the Englewood high school to chat with the boys.""The idea of asking some of the high school players to round out Milwaukee's roster popped into his head. With the game scheduled for a Thursday afternoon, Folz thought there would be no crowd or price of admission, so the high school players' amateur status would not be affected.""I mentioned it, and they were eager to play,"" Folz wrote. ""They seemed to think it would be quite a stunt.""The students, according to a Dec. 24, 1925, article in The Tribune, played ""because they were led into it, believing it was a practice contest, and they wanted to learn some of the fine points of the game from the big pro stars."" They, like Folz, did not think their participation would hurt their amateur standing, the article said.Pruter, who has written extensively about Chicago high school sports, said that the N.F.L. was so young that the differences between high school football and professional football were not nearly as stark as they are today. Folz, a top N.F.L. player, was listed as 5 feet 7 and 157 pounds.""The professional league was still a baby at that time,"" Pruter said. ""I don't think it was that huge of a leap.""And so, when game day arrived, so did the four high school students.According to an Associated Press article published in The New York Times on Dec. 24, 1925, the four boys said they told their parents the night before about their involvement in the game. They also said that they were introduced to the other players under their own names and that they even used their Englewood High School signals.Folz wrote that he distributed Badgers jerseys to the boys, turned them over to McGuirk and ""never thought anything more about it.""""I was somewhat surprised to see there was quite a crowd of spectators at the game,"" he added.Those fans saw a demolition. Chicago, powered by Folz's four touchdowns, won by 59-0.""They were creamed,"" Pruter said of the Badgers. ""It was embarrassing. It was an embarrassing win.""It got worse, for pretty much everyone involved. Joseph Carr, the league president, was in the hospital at the time, recuperating from appendicitis, according to the biography ""The Man Who Built the National Football League: Joe F. Carr"" by Chris Willis.In addition to barring Folz for life, Carr fined the Cardinals $1,000 (about $13,600 in 2015 dollars), put them on probation for one year, fined the Badgers $500 and ordered McGuirk to sell the team within 90 days. (The Badgers ended up folding as a franchise after the 1926 season.)In his state-of-the-league address the next February, Carr said that the incident ""threatened to tear the very foundation from under our league,"" according to the biography, which also said Carr's penalties were ""universally praised across the country.""The high school players were initially barred from athletics for having played against professional players, which represented a violation of amateurism. Perhaps such a young and uncertain league needed Carr's severe punishment, especially given the nature of the scandal: a professional athlete persuading four young players to join an opposing team, for the sake of pursuing a championship.The newspapers painted a picture of ""vile professionals"" luring innocent high school students ""into trouble with lies and deception,"" according to the book ""Shaping College Football: The Transformation of an American Sport, 1919-1930"" by Raymond Schmidt.Folz, for his part, expressed tremendous regret and accepted all blame.""I am heartbroken over it and would do anything in the world to get them back, because those boys were blameless in the affair,"" Folz wrote in The Tribune.Whether his remorse played a role in what happened later is unknown. O'Brien's fine was retracted and Folz's lifetime ban revoked, though he did not return to professional football. The high school players were forgiven, and Richardson and Thompson even earned all-star honors at the end of the season.And after another N.F.L. scandal in December 1925 -- this one involving territorial rights and ending with Carr's suspension of the Pottsville Maroons -- the Chicago Cardinals were named league champions.There is hope for Brady yet.Photograph The Chicago Cardinals Playing Against the Chicago Bears in 1925.

"Manuel Contreras, Chilean Spy Chief, Dies at 86:   [Obituary (Obit); Biography ]",,"SANTIAGO, Chile -- Gen. Manuel Contreras, Chile's intelligence chief during the military dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, died on Friday in the military hospital in Santiago while serving 526 years of multiple prison terms for human rights violations. He was 86.General Contreras, who had colon cancer and advanced diabetes, spent the past 20 years in two special military detention centers, one of which more resembled a resort, as judges piled on almost 60 prison sentences for crimes committed by the National Intelligence Directorate, or DINA, the secret intelligence agency he directed from 1973 to 1977. Appeals were pending in dozens of other cases.After the announcement of his death, dozens of people gathered outside the hospital to celebrate, chanting and opening bottles of Champagne. Dozens of others did the same in Plaza Italia, near downtown Santiago. Some waved Chilean flags and held up pictures of people who had disappeared after General Pinochet's coup in 1973 that overthrew President Salvador Allende. One woman held a sign saying, ""Happy trip to hell, assassin.""DINA, which was established weeks after the coup, operated clandestine detention and torture centers across the country and had been found responsible for most human rights abuses during General Pinochet's 17-year dictatorship. Official human rights reports estimated that more than 3,200 people were executed or never found after being seized, and almost 38,000 were imprisoned and tortured during that period.General Contreras wielded unbridled power to eliminate political opposition and have his agents infiltrate all echelons of society, including government offices, as well as Chilean exile groups. He often boasted that he reported solely to General Pinochet. In the most recent decisions against him, on July 29, judges sentenced General Contreras, who had retired from the military, to 15 years for the disappearance in 1974 of a university student and 20 years for the murder in 1975 of six members of a family, including a pregnant woman. Imprisoned in a DINA torture center, some of those victims had their eyes gouged out, and others were burned with boiling oil or water, according to the investigation.A C.I.A. report released in 2000 said that by April 1975 it had become clear that ""Contreras was the principal obstacle to a reasonable human rights policy within the Junta."" Nevertheless, weeks later, ""elements within the C.I.A. recommended establishing a paid relationship with Contreras to obtain intelligence based on his unique position and access to Pinochet."" The suggestion was overruled, the report said, but ""given miscommunications in the timing of this exchange, a one-time payment was given to Contreras.""General Contreras never admitted to any of his crimes. In his last televised interview in 2013 by CNN Chile, he was defiant and completely unrepentant, denying that any prisoner had ever disappeared, saying that ""they are all in the General Cemetery.""""In the approximately 25 human rights cases related to the DINA in which I have taken part, Contreras never cooperated or provided any truthful information,"" said Francisco Ugas, executive secretary of the Interior Ministry's Human Rights Program, which has served as a plaintiff in a number of judicial investigations.Manuel Contreras was born on May 4, 1929, in Santiago. He is survived by his wife Nélida Gutiérrez and one son and three daughters from a previous marriage. As the director of DINA, he orchestrated a secret alliance known as Operation Condor among the intelligence services of the military governments in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia in the 1970s. It involved intelligence-sharing and coordinated operations to capture, interrogate, torture and exchange prisoners in Condor member countries and carry out assassinations abroad, one of them in the United States.On Sept. 21, 1976, a bomb planted by DINA operatives under the car of Chile's former ambassador to the United States, Orlando Letelier, killed Mr. Letelier and an American colleague, Ronni Moffitt, in Washington.An F.B.I. investigation traced the crime to DINA, and under pressure from the Carter administration, the Chilean government in 1978 handed over to the United States an American citizen Michael V. Townley, a DINA agent involved in the murders. Mr. Townley served a short prison term and was enrolled in the witness protection program.""Manuel Contreras will go down in history as a criminal and will always be remembered as a criminal,"" said Senator Juan Pablo Letelier, the son of Orlando Letelier.In 1978, a grand jury in Washington indicted General Contreras; his deputy, Pedro Espinoza; and another DINA agent, Armando Fernández Larios, and sought their extradition for the Letelier-Moffitt murders. Chile's Supreme Court denied the request, but in 1987, Mr. Fernández surrendered to American officials and reached a plea bargain. Mr. Fernández currently lives in Miami.Photograph Gen.

Slow to Save Salamanders:   [Science Desk ],,"We humans can drive species toward extinction by hunting them or destroying their habitat. But we can also threaten them in a more subtle but no less dangerous way: by making them sick.In the early 1900s, humans introduced malaria-spreading mosquitoes to Hawaii, and many native bird species were decimated. More recently, a fungus introduced to the United States from Europe has proved lethal to several species of bats.Now, scientists and wildlife managers are struggling to prevent the next infectious disaster. A recently discovered fungus is killing salamanders in Europe. It is likely spread by the pet trade and could soon arrive in North America, home to about half of all salamander species.For months, biologists have been calling for a halt to the trade in pet salamanders so they can mount a defense against the fungus. But federal officials have yet to take action.""You would think there would be something in place,"" said Vance T. Vredenburg, a biologist at San Francisco State University. ""We really need a government agency at some level to take action and do something.""Dr. Vredenburg and his colleagues have already seen what a fungal infection can do to amphibians. In the 1990s, they discovered that Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd for short) was wiping out entire populations of frogs. Humans have spread Bd around the world, and now it threatens hundreds of species with extinction.""People really didn't believe that something could happen that was so bad,"" Dr. Vredenburg said. ""I really don't want to see that happen again.""In 2013, unfortunately, scientists in the Netherlands discovered that a related species of fungus, called Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, or Bsal, was killing fire salamanders. Since then, they have also found it in Belgium and Britain.Having seen what Bd could do, researchers scrambled to understand Bsal better. Three species of Asian salamanders that are popular as pets can carry the fungus without getting sick, they found. It is likely that the pet trade is spreading Bsal to wild salamanders in Europe, which have not developed resistance to the disease.Researchers in North America have been looking for Bsal, and so far have not found any trace of it. But based on a study of North American salamanders, published Thursday in the journal Science, Dr. Vredenburg and his colleagues predict that some regions of the continent are at high risk of an outbreak.""It shows a terrible picture,"" Dr. Vredenburg said.The pet trade brings huge numbers of salamanders into the United States. Fish and Wildlife Service records show that about 780,000 salamanders were imported from 2010 to 2014. Dr. Vredenburg and his colleagues found that 98 percent of the imported animals were native to Asia.In Asia, Bsal-carrying salamanders tend to live in cool, moist climates. Dr. Vredenburg and his colleagues identified several regions in North America with the same conditions where the fungus should grow well. Some of these regions are home to a high diversity of salamanders.The scientists identified three regions as particularly hospitable to Bsal: the Southeast, the Pacific Northwest and Sierra Nevadas, and the highlands of central Mexico.Dr. Vredenburg sees an additional threat to salamanders in these areas: Some regional cities, such as San Francisco and Atlanta, are arrival points for imported salamanders.Because Bsal was discovered only two years ago, scientists still have a lot to learn about it. The fungus may grow in a wider range of conditions than currently known, for example. Discovering new host species in Asia could help scientists better predict where else Bsal could thrive in North America.Karen R. Lips, a biologist at the University of Maryland, agrees with Dr. Vredenburg that the United States should ban imported pet salamanders, at least until scientists can figure out the scale of the Bsal threat and come up with a plan for blocking it.It might become possible, for example, to test imported salamanders for Bsal and disinfect animals carrying the fungus. ""The longer we can keep things out, the better chance we'll have of putting a plan in place,"" Dr. Lips said.The Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council supports a temporary halt in salamander imports. ""A moratorium on importation of Bsal-susceptible salamanders should be put into place until such time as effective testing and treatment regimens have been developed,"" Robert Likins, the council's director of governmental affairs, wrote in an email.The Fish and Wildlife Service can stop the import of ""injurious wildlife"" under a law known as the Lacey Act. This spring, the service announced that it would evaluate pet salamanders for their risk of introducing Bsal. That process is inching along.""The act does not include a provision to list injurious species on an emergency basis,"" said Laury Marshall Parramore, a spokeswoman for the service.Priya Nanjappa of the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies said that the Bsal experience showed how badly we need new laws allowing the government to respond effectively to emerging wildlife diseases.""It's demonstrating that even when we have the foresight, we're still stumbling,"" she said.Photograph Salamanders in the Pacific Northwest, Like This Western Red-Backed, May Be Vulnerable to a Fungus That has Decimated European Salamanders and Could Come to the United States.

Bush Campaign Sees Upside to Trump's Surge in the G.O.P.:   [National Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- It may be the Summer of Trump, but the publicity-hungry real estate magnate is not the only Republican presidential candidate relishing all his attention.Donald J. Trump's surge in the polls has been met with barely concealed delight by Jeb Bush and his supporters. Mr. Trump's bombastic ways have simultaneously made it all but impossible for those vying to be the alternative to Mr. Bush to emerge, and easier for Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, to position himself as the serious and thoughtful alternative to a candidate who has upended the early nominating process.With little indication that his support is slipping and the promise of the center stage at Thursday's debate, Mr. Trump has essentially frozen the rest of the field.""The longer it goes, the greater the panic is going to build,"" said Alex Castellanos, a longtime Republican strategist. ""And that means you may not have the luxury to flirt with an undeveloped, budding candidate. Trump has set the Republican Party on fire, and if you're going to put that fire out you don't have time to waste. You're going to have to grab the biggest blanket you got and throw it, and right now that's Jeb.""Many Republican officials, while acknowledging that Mr. Trump has tapped into the current of anti-establishment anger, believe he has little chance to ultimately win the nomination. The broad attention given to his position atop national polls overshadows more worrisome indicators for him, including the substantial number of potential primary voters who say they would not support him under any circumstances.But for the moment he is depriving many of the other 16 Republican candidates of the political oxygen they need to win attention from grass-roots supporters in early nominating states and commitments from fence-riding donors.That mainly helps Mr. Bush, who can quietly continue to build his daunting advantages in money and organization while his would-be challengers struggle to break through.The frustration among those other aspirants is beginning to spill into public.""I think this is a temporary loss of sanity,"" Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said on CNN Thursday of Mr. Trump's support, adding: ""If you would give some other candidates time from 8 in the morning to 8 at night all day long for three weeks, I'm guessing some other candidates might rise as well.""Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey could barely contain his exasperation when asked about Mr. Trump's claim that he would not only build a wall on the Mexican border but would even have Mexico pay for it.""When you do that, it hurts the credibility of the presidency,"" Mr. Christie said on CNBC.A Monmouth University poll of New Hampshire voters released last week emphasized the problem for them: With Mr. Trump in the race, Mr. Christie drew 4 percent and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin 7 percent. But the same poll showed that, if Mr. Trump were to drop out, Mr. Christie would pick up 15 percent of Trump voters, and Mr. Walker 14 percent.In Iowa, a crucial state for Mr. Walker, Mr. Trump is now statistically tied with him, according to an NBC Marist poll of potential Republican caucusgoers.Mr. Bush's enthusiasts, meanwhile, are all but giddy, even though it would be much better if he were simply dominating the field.""You got to give Trump credit,"" Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said with a grin. ""He's really created a firestorm here. Because he is such a controversial character, and an interesting one at that, it's taken away opportunities for an awful lot of others to break through."" At the same time, Mr. Hatch said, Mr. Bush ""comes across as the one guy you can rely on.""Mr. Bush has been openly critical of Mr. Trump and ""the vitriol that he's spewing out these days,"" while being increasingly emphatic about the need for Republicans to embrace a more optimistic and inclusive message. It is a theme aimed not just at the general electorate, but also at Republican primary voters eager to back a candidate who can generate broad appeal and win the White House.""We have to campaign all across this country with joy in our heart rather than anger,"" Mr. Bush said in suburban Orlando last week, vowing to a heavily white crowd that he would campaign in minority communities and on college campuses -- ""places where Republicans haven't been seen in a long, long while.""Mr. Bush's campaign is aggressively highlighting these efforts. He began last week speaking before a diverse group of pastors in Orlando, which has a fast-growing Hispanic population, and sitting for an interview with Jose Diaz-Balart of MSNBC.And he ended it with an address to the National Urban League Conference and an interview with Lester Holt of NBC.Privately, Mr. Bush's top strategists, who have become increasingly fixated on halting Mr. Walker, believe that Mr. Trump is nothing short of a godsend. That is because Mr. Trump is drawing support from voters -- blue-collar, less-educated, more conservative -- who are unlikely ever to support Mr. Bush but are essential to Mr. Walker's candidacy.What complicates matters for Mr. Walker, and any of the other Republicans vying for that restive conservative base, is that they will have difficulty matching the bluster or promises of Mr. Trump because he does not operate within the conventional boundaries of political discourse.""Trump is much more willing to be provocative,"" said David Winston, a Republican pollster. ""He'll say something outrageous, and then where do they go? And that's the challenge.""The extent to which the other candidates feel they need to compete with Mr. Trump for that pool of voters may become clear in Thursday's debate. If candidates like Mr. Walker, Mr. Christie, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas directly engage with Mr. Trump, it is an indication of the urgency they feel to cut into his support.But it is unclear what exactly can be done to tarnish Mr. Trump with voters who are drawn to him. His incendiary comments and his personal history have done little to diminish his appeal.""It'll be death by 100 cuts, and he's probably only in his 20s,"" conceded Chris LaCivita, an adviser to Mr. Paul and a veteran operative, adding that Mr. Bush's team is ""laughing their way through the summer.""Even those skeptical about Mr. Trump now say they believe he will remain a factor in the race into this fall, at least through the second debate in mid-September. Many party strategists anticipate he will ultimately self-destruct if exposed as having little familiarity with the pressing issues facing the country.If there is good news about Mr. Trump's rise for those looking for a shot at Mr. Bush, it is that the first votes will not be cast for six months.""If you're another candidate, the good thing is that it's early,"" said Robert Gleason, chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, adding of Mr. Trump: ""He's put the block on everything, just stopped everything dead.""Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.Photograph Jeb Bush Spoke at the National Urban League Conference in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., On Friday, Part of an Effort to Go to ""Places Where Republicans Haven't Been Seen in a Long, Long While.""

"In India, Glimpses of Economic Optimism and Frustration:   [Editorial ]",,"MUMBAI, India -- Arriving at the new international airport here last month, I felt like I had gotten on the wrong connecting flight and ended up in Shanghai. Instead of the smelly and decaying terminal I remembered from the four years I spent here as a news correspondent, the building was sparkling. The walkway to the immigration counter doubled as a museum filled with paintings, sculptures and handmade crafts from around the country.But the old familiar India soon returned when my cousin drove me out of the parking garage and past the slums near the airport that were made famous by Katherine Boo's book, ""Behind the Beautiful Forevers."" Stunning wealth and wrenching poverty have always coexisted here. And it still does -- despite the unbridled optimism of politicians, business executives and middle-class Indians about the kind of economic transformation symbolized by Mumbai's airport. I spent a week listening to such talk. Everybody was sure things would change for the rest of India just as they had for the airport because the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a technocrat with a controversial past, had captured a landslide election victory last year.The rest of the world is also hopeful about India. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are projecting that India will become the world's fastest-growing major economy in the next several years, surpassing China. The Indian government said this week that its economy may already be growing as fast or faster than China's.It is inevitable that India will eventually grow faster than China for the simple mathematical reason that it is easier to make a small economy bigger than it is to increase the size of a larger one. China's economy was more than twice as big as India's in 2013, after adjusting for population and purchasing power, according to the World Bank. Also, China's population is aging and its labor force is shrinking whereas about half of Indians are 25 or younger and its work force will be expanding for many years to come.What is less clear is the kind of an economy India will have. Will it be one that caters to the small elite that can afford air travel, or will there also be money and room for decent, affordable housing with running water and round-the-clock electricity? A recent report found that the country has the largest number of billionaires after the United States and China. Yet roughly half the population is stuck in subsistence farming, hoping for better futures for their children. Those young people receive such a lousy education that many businesses consider them unemployable. Many Indians recognize their country's unique challenges, which will take years to address successfully even as others hope for revolutionary change. I struck up a conversation with a working-class man I met in the northern city of Jaipur, Chhagan, who only identified himself by one name. I asked him if he thought Mr. Modi would make India better, he said: ""Modi is a good man, but he is just one man."" At the Jaipur Literature Festival being held nearby, corporate executives, analysts and government officials offered a more upbeat assessment. One session was titled ""India's Turn: Catalyzing Economic Transformation.""Mr. Modi's government, in office for less than nine months, has already raised expectations significantly among investors and ordinary people by promising to turn the country into a latter-day China with bullet trains, 100 new ""smart"" cities and tens of millions of manufacturing jobs.But there is growing frustration that the change he promised might not come soon enough or that it might be disrupted by some of his fanatical right-wing supporters. Nearly two-thirds of Indians surveyed in a recent poll commissioned by The Times of India said Hindu nationalist groups allied with the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., were hurting ""the development agenda."" Earlier this week, an upstart political party trounced Mr. Modi's B.J.P. in local elections in the territory of Delhi. Last year, his party swept all seven races for the lower house of Parliament in Delhi.Economic euphoria can evaporate quickly. When I lived there in 2010, the Indian economy roared back to life after the financial crisis, and seemingly everyone thought the good times were back for good. The Economist magazine, for example, published on its cover a photo of a racing tiger under the headline ""How India's growth will outpace China's."" But that growth spurt fizzled largely because political leaders at the time became complacent and let corruption and mismanagement spiral out of control.Later this month, Mr. Modi's government is scheduled to present its first full-year budget. Investors and business executives are hoping that it will include proposals for transportation projects, the sale of government-owned companies and changes in taxation. While such measures are important, the budget will have failed if it does not offer a plan to improve public services like education, health and housing.Mr. Modi cannot be expected to cure all of India's problems. For one thing, he is not as powerful as he seems. Like the United States, India is a federal country in which state governments provide most public services. His job is to use all the tools at his disposal to make sure the poorest Indians are not left behind as the economy revs up.Graph Graphic",0.0
"Muslims, Marriage and Bigotry:   Commentary",,"In North Carolina, three young Muslims who were active in charity work were murdered, allegedly by a man who identified as atheist and expressed hostility to Islam and other faiths. Police are exploring whether it was a hate crime, and it spurred a #MuslimLivesMatter campaign on Twitter.And, in Alabama, we see judges refusing to approve marriages of any kind because then they would also have to approve same-sex marriages. In one poll conducted last year, some 59 percent of people in Alabama opposed gay marriage. Somehow a loving God is cited to bar loving couples from committing to each other.These are very different news stories. But I wonder if a common lesson from both may be the importance of resisting bigotry, of combating the intolerance that can infect people of any faith -- or of no faith.I don't think Muslims should feel obliged to apologize for the Charlie Hebdo terror attacks. Nor do I think atheists need apologize for the killing of the three Muslims.But it does seem useful for everyone to reflect on our capacity to ""otherize"" people of a different faith, race, nationality or sexuality -- and to turn that other-ness into a threat. That's what the Islamic State does to us. And sometimes that's what we do, too.O.K. I'm sure some of you are protesting: That's a false equivalency. True, there is a huge difference between burning someone alive and not granting a couple a marriage license. But, then again, it's not much of a slogan to say, ""We're better than ISIS!""There has been a pugnacious defensiveness among conservative Christians to any parallels between Christian overreach and Islamic overreach, as seen in the outraged reaction to President Obama's acknowledgment at the National Prayer Breakfast this month that the West has plenty to regret as well. But Obama was exactly right: How can we ask Islamic leaders to confront extremism in their faith if we don't acknowledge Christian extremism, from the Crusades to Srebrenica?More broadly, one message of the New Testament is the value of focusing on one's own mistakes rather than those of others. ""You hypocrite,"" Jesus says in Matthew 7:5. ""First take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.""We could do with a little more of that spirit these days, at a time when everybody wants to practice ophthalmology on everyone else.When I posted on my Facebook page about the North Carolina murders, one follower, Frank, wrote dismissively: ""Muslims are slaughtering people around the globe (including their own) but let's highlight this story -- seems legit.""I've previously urged Muslims to reflect on intolerance in their camp, and this is an occasion when Christians, atheists and others can do the same. Did the furor in North Carolina that led to the cancellation of the Muslim call to prayer from Duke University's chapel tower inflame sentiments?The Alabama legal drama, with Chief Justice Roy S. Moore of the State Supreme Court defying federal authorities, is, of course, different. But it also is redolent of faith as I-am-holier-than-thou chest-thumping, a reminder of the need for humility.Do Judge Moore and other conservative Christians think that when God made gays and lesbians fall achingly in love with each other, He screwed up?It seems odd to me that so many conservative Christians are obsessed with homosexuality, which Jesus never mentions, yet seem unworried about issues Jesus did emphasize like poverty and suffering. Jesus explicitly advised a wealthy man, ""Go, sell your possessions and give to the poor"" (Matthew 19:21), so maybe that's the Scripture that Judge Moore should follow to demonstrate his piety.Then there's Jesus's praise for those who make themselves eunuchs (Matthew 19:12); but I'd settle for a little ""love thy neighbor as thyself.""I've written often about committed and self-effacing Christians doing outstanding work combating injustice around the world, and it's frustrating that they don't get attention. The problem is that their heroism is often overshadowed by sanctimonious blowhards.Among Americans aged 18 to 24, a 2012 survey found that half or more describe present-day Christianity as ""hypocritical,"" ""judgmental"" and ""anti-gay."" And more regarded it as immoral to view pornography than to have sex with a person of the same gender. Alabama is, once again, on the wrong side of history.Pope Francis has been a breath of fresh air to Catholics and non-Catholics alike because he seems less moralizing and more moral, less about pointing a finger and more about offering a helping hand. After the tragedy in North Carolina and the legal chaos in Alabama, maybe that's a good instinct for all of us.I'm trying something new, an email newsletter.

A Chinese Investment Helps A.I.G. Profit Climb:   [Brief ],,"The insurance company American International Group reported a 5.6 percent increase in quarterly operating profit, driven by investments in one of China's biggest insurers, the People's Insurance Group of China Limited, as well as earnings from the aircraft leasing company AerCap Holdings N.V. A.I.G., the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, also increased its share buyback program by up to $5 billion, and more than doubled its quarterly dividend to 28 cents a share. Operating income after tax increased to $1.9 billion, or $1.39 per diluted share, in the second quarter, from $1.8 billion, or $1.23 per diluted share, a year earlier.The operating income was bumped up by pretax earnings that more than doubled, to $127 million, from AerCap, the world's largest independent aircraft lessor. A.I.G., which is trying to exit AerCap, sold most of its 46 percent stake in early June.The insurer, which began in a two-room office in Shanghai in 1919, also gained $170 million from investments in the People's Insurance Group of China Limited, PICC Property and Casualty Company Limited. However, A.I.G.'s underwriting operations struggled with plummeting commercial property and casualty insurance rates. Pretax operating profit fell 4 percent, to $1.19 billion, in its commercial property and casualty insurance business, typically a strength. The insurer also paid out $88 million more in catastrophe losses. A.I.G.'s stock closed at $64.14 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.",0.0
Designate a Devil's Advocate:   [Question ],,"This interview with Kevin E. Lofton, chief executive of Catholic Health Initiatives, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.Q. Were you in leadership roles when you were younger?A. A lot of what I learned from an early age was around influence. I was involved in a lot of things. I ran track in high school, and I also played piano and competitive chess. I think people generally always looked at me as a leader, and I felt like I was having influence. People wanted to know what I had to say.I didn't have a lot of formal leadership positions, though I was class vice president in my sophomore year of high school, during the same year that Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the class president.Tell me about your parents.My father was an electrician. He worked two jobs when we were young. My mom was a dental assistant during most of my years growing up. She later went back to school and became a dental hygienist.My grandmother in Texas was a big influence on us, too. She was a domestic, but she was a fighter. Needless to say, it was segregated down in Texas at the time, and the street my grandparents lived on when I was little still had ditches. My grandmother led the civic effort to get the streets paved.Another influential person was the dentist my mother worked for. He treated us like we were his children, and a lot of the exposure that I got to things at an early age came through his influence. His wife, for instance, was a bass cellist in the symphony orchestra, and we would go to concerts at Lincoln Center. He actually paid for me to go to the music school that his children were in. We played in Carnegie Hall and New York World's Fair.What was your first management role?My first hospital job was as an emergency department administrator in Jacksonville, Fla. At the time, it was the seventh-busiest emergency department in the country. I was probably 24 and straight out of grad school. I had a staff of about 250 people.That's a big jump. How did you handle it?I realized that a big part of my job was to help people see the ultimate value of the job they do. It was also about looking at what needed to be done and not accepting any excuses. This was a county hospital, the kind of place where sometimes people accept mediocrity. I moved up rapidly because I didn't accept that, and I got things done.At the end of the day, people really want to do the right thing. I saw my job as removing barriers and then celebrating successes. I also brought people into the process. When you bring staff into a meeting and you talk to them about the things we can do to improve, and then you actually act on their ideas and they see that their input made a difference, people will follow you.You also have to be able to relate to people, and not look down on them or talk down to them. I may have a title, but that's not the reason that we need to do this. We're here to do A, B and C. Here's the way you can help with that. What suggestions do you have to make it better? Those are the secrets to success.Were you ever nervous about all that responsibility at such a young age?An early mentor of mine said something to me when I was going to a new job: ""Don't worry. It's just another dog and pony show."" That really stayed with me. When you're taking on another new challenge, you just take a couple of deep breaths and say, ""You can do this. It's just another dog and pony show.""What's unusual about the culture of your current company?In our senior management meetings, we appoint a designated devil's advocate, as we call it. So if we're discussing a critical issue, we'll appoint someone -- and the role rotates -- to be the devil's advocate, no matter what their personal point of view is. That helps you avoid groupthink.How do you hire?I start with the ""why"" -- why are you here, why would this role fit into your career path, and why are you interested in coming to our organization? I then focus on the ""what"" -- what are the things that you've done that relate to what you might do here, and what are your ideas for how you can help us?And then I move to the ""how,"" and that's where character comes in. How do you do business? Somebody might be a cardiovascular surgeon who is going to put a lot of money on our bottom line, but if they yell at nurses in the operating room, then we don't want them.What kind of advice do you give to new college grads?I give a lot of talks to students, and I usually close the sessions with this advice: They should take a blank sheet of paper and an envelope, write down a goal of something that they want to do over the coming year, then seal it. Nobody's ever going to see this except you, I tell them -- it's not for your teachers; it's not for your parents; it's just for yourself.Then a year later, you take it out and grade yourself on whether you worked toward that goal, and then you set a new goal for the next year. It's really just to get them in the habit of looking at the things they need to work on, setting a personal goal and then seeing how they've done against that goal. I still do this myself every year.AuthorAffiliation ADAM BRYANT Each week, Adam Bryant talks with top executives about leadership. Follow him on Twitter: @nytcorneroffice.

Ex-Officer Faces New Charge in Rikers Death:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"A former New York City correction officer implicated in the beating death of a Rikers Island inmate could, if convicted, face up to life in prison after a federal grand jury in Manhattan upgraded the charges against him on Tuesday.The former officer, Brian Coll, was arrested in June for the 2012 death of Ronald Spear, a 52-year-old inmate with kidney problems who walked with a cane. Federal authorities say Mr. Coll, 45, kicked Mr. Spear in the head repeatedly while he was being restrained by two other guards and then falsified official records to make it appear that the use of force had been warranted.Mr. Coll was originally charged with deprivation of rights under color of law and obstruction of justice. On Tuesday, the grand jury added a more serious charge alleging that his actions directly caused Mr. Spear's death.In a statement, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Mr. Spear's death ""was the direct result of Correction Officer Brian Coll's unconstitutional beating."" Mr. Bharara added, ""Repeatedly kicking a downed inmate in the head and then picking up and dropping his head on the ground as he lay helpless, as Correction Officer Coll is alleged to have done, had deadly consequences for Ronald Spear.""Since his arrest, Mr. Coll, who pleaded not guilty to the original charges, has been held at the federal detention center in Brooklyn while he awaits trial. His lawyer, Sam A. Schmidt, said on Tuesday that it was Mr. Spear's serious health problems and aggressive behavior toward officers that ultimately caused his death. ""The jury will be able to see the other side of the story and not simply the allegations by the government,"" Mr. Schmidt said.Another officer, Byron Taylor, 31, who the authorities say held Mr. Spear down while he was beaten, faces several charges, including obstruction of justice for allegedly lying to a federal grand jury. A third officer, Anthony Torres, 59, has already pleaded guilty to filing a false report and conspiracy to obstruct justice in the case. He is scheduled to be sentenced in December.Last year, New York City agreed to pay $2.75 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Mr. Spear's family.",0.0
"At Hiroshima, Japan Again Mourns Dawn of Atomic Age:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"HIROSHIMA, Japan -- Every year on Aug. 6, Hiroshima becomes a city of mourning. And one full of reminders -- some delivered politely, some pointedly -- of the most extreme dangers of modern warfare.Seventy years ago, the city was incinerated by an atomic bomb, its population halved by the new and terrifying American weapon nicknamed Little Boy.On Thursday, political leaders, aging survivors and ordinary citizens gathered at 8:15 a.m. to mourn the moment when the city unwillingly became part of the world's introduction to the nuclear age. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima, together with another that hit Nagasaki three days later, killed more than 200,000 people, most of them civilians.At a ceremony near the onetime industrial exhibition hall that has been preserved as a skeletal monument to the attack, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe renewed a longstanding Japanese pledge to seek worldwide elimination of nuclear weapons. The mayor of Hiroshima, Kazumi Matsui, accused ""selfish"" nuclear powers, including the United States, of standing in the way of that goal.Mr. Abe and other dignitaries placed wreaths in front of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park's eternal flame, where a placard reads: ""Rest in peace. We will not make the same mistake again."" A minute of silence was punctuated by the ringing of a temple gong.The memorial was witnessed by the United States ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy, who was only the second American envoy to attend such a commemoration. Her predecessor, John V. Roos, first did so five years ago, on the 65th anniversary of the bombing, in a shift that was seen as symbolic of the Obama administration's commitment to advancing the cause of nuclear disarmament. But a visit to Hiroshima by President Obama himself, which many in Japan hoped would follow, never came -- much less an apology by the United States for dropping the bombs. The desire for an apology has persisted here even as Japan struggles to come to terms with atrocities committed by its own forces during World War II.Mr. Abe is also pursuing unpopular policies on two issues linked closely in the public's mind with the bombings: national defense and nuclear energy. Small groups of demonstrators gathered at the edge of the ceremony grounds to protest moves by his government to pare back postwar restrictions on the military and to restart nuclear power plants idled after meltdowns at a plant in Fukushima in 2011.Kohei Oiwa, an 83-year-old bombing survivor, sat silently through Mr. Abe's remarks at the ceremony but criticized him bluntly afterward. He condemned legislation now before Parliament that would allow Japanese forces to fight overseas, in limited situations, for the first time since the war. And he criticized as hypocritical the government's repeated pledges to help rid the world of nuclear weapons. Japan, he noted, accepts the protection of the United States, its former enemy turned close ally, including the deterrent provided by the American nuclear arsenal.""Abe's peace is a phony peace,"" Mr. Oiwa said as he waited in line to lay a bouquet of flowers in front of the eternal flame.Such sentiments are widely shared by other survivors. After the ceremony, the leaders of seven groups representing survivors delivered a letter to Mr. Abe demanding that he withdraw the proposed legislation on military deployments. Yet while there are still close to 200,000 officially recognized survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, their average age is over 80, and their numbers are quickly dwindling.The mayor, Mr. Matsui, also took clear if indirect aim at Mr. Abe. In his official ""peace declaration,"" he criticized a desire often expressed by the prime minister and other conservatives to change the pacifist Constitution imposed by the victorious United States. Three generations after the conflict, they argue, Japan should be less constrained by its consequences. Mr. Matsui, however, said, ""It is demanded that the path to true peace indicated by the pacifism of the Japanese Constitution be spread to the world.""Hiroshima, which rebounded vigorously after World War II, is now a thriving city of 1.1 million people, and most of its residents are less overtly political. Kazue Ichikawa, 77, who came to the ceremony with her daughter and granddaughter, said she was in the yard of a Buddhist temple that served as a wartime primary school when the bomb exploded. It was just far enough away that she and her classmates were spared. ""The force knocked me over a gravestone,"" she said.She said that she had not recounted her experiences to anyone outside her family, but that she was considering volunteering at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum ""to inform others of my granddaughter's generation.""Photograph Lanterns Were Released Into a River in Hiroshima On Thursday, As the City Remembered the 1945 Atomic Bomb Attack.

"Activists Block Repair of Sabotaged Lines in Crimea, Leaving Region in Darkness:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"MOSCOW -- Crimean Tatar activists and Ukrainian nationalists on Monday prevented repair crews from restoring the main power lines in southern Ukraine that supply Crimea, leaving the disputed peninsula in the dark and Ukraine and Russia headed toward a standoff over the issue.The power lines were knocked down by saboteurs on Sunday, forcing millions of residents to live without electricity.The Tatar activists who blockaded the damaged site said they would thwart repairs until Russia released political prisoners and allowed international organizations to monitor human rights in Crimea. The activists say that the 300,000-member Tatar minority has faced systematic repression since Russia annexed the peninsula in March 2014.President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine, without mentioning the electricity cutoff directly, appeared to endorse the confrontation.After a meeting with the foreign ministers of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, Mr. Poroshenko echoed the demands of the Tatar protesters, saying that the international community should work to release arrested activists, restore Crimean Tatar broadcasts and reverse the exile of Tatar leaders.""We are not satisfied with today's status quo when the occupational authorities neglect basic rights of Crimea Tatars,"" Mr. Poroshenko said, before making an indirect reference to the destruction of the electricity lines. ""These irresponsible actions caused significant escalation between the activists and occupational authorities.""Mr. Poroshenko also released a letter on Monday that he had first sent to the Ukrainian cabinet on Nov. 4, calling on the prime minister to study the question of halting all freight transport to and from Crimea.The sudden release of the letter almost 20 days after he sent it also seemed to offer a subtle endorsement of the electricity protest.In Moscow, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, reacted calmly, saying that he was unaware of any timetable to repair the lines but that he hoped that Ukraine would take ""rapid measures"" to do the work.President Vladimir V. Putin, who was traveling to a meeting of gas exporters in Iran, did not immediately comment. He was unlikely to take kindly to Ukraine disrupting life for all of Crimea, however, given that he has made its absorption into Russia something of a personal project.Sergei V. Aksyonov, the Kremlin-appointed prime minister of the Crimean Republic, was more exercised, calling the power cutoff ""a terrorist act"" in a statement on Monday.""I would urge Crimeans to be patient and to see what our situation is,"" Mr. Aksyonov said. ""Nobody will be allowed to blackmail us in order to solve any issues.""Ukraine still claims the peninsula, and its senior officials have been perturbed that its seizure by Russia has seemingly dropped off the international agenda, rating a fleeting mention at best whenever the crisis over fighting in southeastern Ukraine is discussed.The issue of supplies coming from Ukraine has been a repeated source of tension, as food, water and electricity still flow from the mainland to the peninsula. A major irrigation canal was shut down in 2014, but significant rainfall and other local sources prevented serious damage to crops this year. In September, Tatar and other activists tried to blockade the main road leading from Crimea to Ukraine, disrupting food supplies.Crimea's only other surface link to the outside world is a ferry line to Russia, with limited capacity. Russia plans to build an enormous bridge, but that would not be completed for at least three years.It was not immediately clear who destroyed the main electric pylons on Friday and Sunday, but the blasted away stump of at least one near the demonstrators was wrapped in the distinctive Crimean Tatar flag, blue with a yellow trident in the upper left-hand corner.Video shown by the ATR network, a Tatar television station now operating in Ukraine after its main channel in Crimea was forced to close, showed Tatar activists tackling the special Ukrainian police units trying to gain access for repair crews.The leadership of both the Crimean Tatars, forced into exile by Russia, and a right-wing nationalist group, Right Sector, endorsed the destruction without claiming responsibility.Mustafa A. Dzhemilev, the leader of the Crimean Tatar minority, told the Ukrainian news website Lega.net that the power pylons ""could have been blown away by the wind.""""Why should we supply the invader with everything he needs?"" asked Mr. Dzhemilev, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament. ""If they have occupied our territory, then we must smoke them out.""Mr. Dzhemilev said those blockading the site would allow repairs to the power lines that supply electricity to the surrounding area in the Ukrainian region of Kherson, but not to Crimea.Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk of Ukraine said he would begin negotiations with Tatar representatives on Monday to try to allow repair crews to begin to work, but there were no immediate results from the discussions.Russian officials said the power supply could be restored in two hours after the trunk lines were repaired. Senior officials at Ukrenergo, which runs Ukraine's power grid, said it would take three to four days to rebuild the pylons.Four local power plants, including two nuclear ones, scaled back production because they had no means to distribute the electricity, Ukrenergo said.More than 1.6 million people still lacked power on Monday morning, Russia's Energy Ministry said in a statement. Local power plants in Crimea, as well as backup generators, were being used to provide power to hospitals, schools and other vital facilities.Russian news media played down the effects of the blockade, noting that balmy weather conditions made heating unnecessary. The Ukrainian news media painted a bleaker picture, emphasizing that cellphones and most gas stations were out of service. Pictures from Crimea showed long lines forming at gas stations and bakeries, and vendors selling candles on street corners.The Crimean authorities declared Monday a day off for nongovernment workers and declared a state of emergency, which can last as long as one month. Crimean officials also said they had enough fuel stocks on hand to keep the backup power plants and generators running for a month.Russia is building an ""energy bridge"" from its mainland territory to Crimea that officials hope will supply most of the peninsula's needs. Its first phase will begin operating by the end of this year, Mr. Aksyonov said.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"Brazilian Implicated in FIFA Case Remains Free, Unlike Many Others:   [Sports Desk ]",,"Some are sitting in jail in Switzerland, while others are under house arrest in places including New York and Asunción, Paraguay. But of the 14 people indicted in May in a far-reaching corruption case within world soccer, only one remains a free man.José Margulies, 75, has not had his daily routine disrupted in São Paulo, Brazil, in a country whose constitution forbids the extradition of its citizens unless they are accused of trafficking drugs or of committing crimes that predate their Brazilian citizenship.""He's living in Brazil as a free man because, according to Brazilian law, it's impossible to charge him,"" said Jair Jaloreto, Mr. Margulies's lawyer. ""He's old and sick, and he mostly prefers to stay home with his wife.""Mr. Margulies has heart disease and diabetes, Mr. Jaloreto said. He was, however, on vacation in Germany when United States officials indicted him in May, according to Mr. Jaloreto; he returned to Brazil soon after and has not left since.As other countries have done with the implicated FIFA officials and business executives who live within their borders, Brazil has begun its own investigation into the United States' allegations against Mr. Margulies. He was indicted on four counts of racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, based on allegations that he, as a broadcasting executive, helped arrange illegal payments between marketing executives and soccer officials.But Brazil's inquiry is expected to take at least a year, Mr. Margulies's lawyer estimated, and in the interim he will remain free.""Without a judicial order, it's impossible to arrest him,"" said Antonio Sergio Pitombo, a lawyer with the Moraes Pitombo firm in São Paulo. But while extradition is unlikely, he said, it is not impossible. Mr. Pitombo suggested that under the Palermo convention, which relates to organized crime and corruption, the Brazilian authorities could agree to send Mr. Margulies to the United States temporarily to testify, requiring that he be returned to Brazil afterward.Mr. Margulies -- who according to prosecutors also goes by José Lazaro, a ""nickname,"" according to his lawyer -- was born in Argentina. He became a Brazilian citizen in 1973, decades before activities that led to the charges began. He also holds Polish and Argentine citizenship.The federal police in Brazil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""It's extremely common for countries all around the world to put in place protections for their own nationals,"" said Rebecca Niblock, an extradition lawyer with Kingsley Napley in London, noting that Russia uniformly refuses to extradite its nationals and that Switzerland, too, offers its citizens strong protections.Though six of the indicted FIFA officials remain in Switzerland, where they were arrested, they are not citizens of that country. Another official, Jeffrey Webb, the former president of a regional soccer confederation, was also arrested there, but he consented to extradition and was arraigned in federal court in Brooklyn last month. Mr. Webb is out on bail in New York, as is Alejandro Burzaco, a marketing executive who turned himself in to the authorities in Italy.Elsewhere, several defendants are fighting extradition but have been arrested by local authorities who are carrying out their own investigations. Among them is Nicolas Léoz, who is under house arrest in Paraguay while that country continues its own inquiry into the charges against him.Ms. Niblock said it was not unexpected that Brazil's investigation of Mr. Margulies might extend into next year while he remained free. ""An investigation like this one would be immensely complicated, and a year would be perfectly reasonable,"" she said.In the interim, Mr. Margulies is immune to arrest only if he remains in Brazil, and international authorities are on alert. In June, Interpol issued so-called red notices for Mr. Margulies and five other defendants, telegraphing that they are wanted by the United States authorities.On Friday, Pietro Calcaterra of Interpol confirmed that the notice for Mr. Margulies was still in effect, meaning if he were to travel outside of Brazil, the United States authorities would be notified upon his arrival in another country.Interpol is also still on watch for Jack Warner, a former FIFA vice president and a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago. Mr. Warner, too, has largely continued about his daily life in that country, where he is active in politics. But, unlike Mr. Margulies, Mr. Warner was arrested and required to surrender his passport before posting bail.Edward Fitzgerald, a lawyer representing Mr. Warner, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York declined to comment.""Mr. Margulies is still wanted by the F.B.I,"" Kelly Langmesser, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York, said Friday. ""He's a wanted fugitive, and we still have a poster out for him.""",0.0
Iowa's Opening Burst Dooms a Cooling Maryland:   [Sports Desk ],,"Iowa could be primed for a big run in the final month of the season, and Maryland could be in danger of a slide at the end of its first year in the Big Ten.Aaron White scored 17 points, Adam Woodbury matched a career high with 16, and host Iowa throttled 17th-ranked Maryland, 71-55, on Sunday.Peter Jok also matched a career high with 15 points for the Hawkeyes (15-8, 6-4), who have won two in a row to finish above .500 in a brutal 10-game start to league play.Iowa opened the game on a 22-3 run and handed the Terrapins their third straight road loss; all of those losses have been by double-digit margins.""We got going offensively, and it snowballed on them a little bit,"" Iowa Coach Fran McCaffery said.The Terrapins (19-5, 7-4) scored just 17 points on 6-of-25 shooting in the first half.

The Terrapins looked just as bad against the Hawkeyes.Maryland had as many turnovers -- eight -- as it did shots in the first 10 minutes. Its defense was even worse, allowing Iowa -- which entered the game ranked 12th in the Big Ten in field-goal percentage -- to hit 10 of its first 15 shots.The Terrapins got a bit of traction behind Trimble and some full-court pressure, but their horrid start was simply too much to overcome. A dunk by White put Iowa up by 34-13 with 2 minutes 3 seconds left before halftime.Dez Wells had 12 points for Maryland, which had 16 turnovers.Mike Gesell had nine assists for the Hawkeyes, whose schedule lightens considerably from this point.

"Paid Notice: Deaths ZAZANIS, GEORGE A.:   [Paid Death Notice ]",,"ZAZANIS--George A.,M.D, pioneer of neurosurgery and former Chief of Neurosurgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, died of cancer on February 4th, 2015, in Vero Beach, Florida. He was 84 years old. Born in Youngstown, Ohio to parents who emigrated from Greece, Dr. Zazanis graduated from the University of Michigan. He earned both M.D. and M.S. degrees from Temple University School of Medicine, and while enlisted as a U.S. Army captain in Newfoundland, Canada, he was awarded a commendation medal in 1959. He completed his residency at Temple University, where he met Marina Pappas Zazanis, his adoring wife of 52 years. Following his residency, he joined the practice of his late partner Henry Liss, and in 1965, they performed the first stereotactic neurosurgical operation in the state of New Jersey. He served as Chief of Neurosurgery at Morristown Memorial Hospital until 1987, when he was appointed to chair the department at UMDNJ. Dr. Zazanis' neurosurgical procedures and clinical research were widely presented and published, and he sponsored numerous postgraduate candidates and postdoctoral fellows. Dr. Zazanis was honored with the title of Archon for his outstanding leadership and service to the Greek Orthodox Church and to the community at large.

Kerry Hails Progress on Trade Pact With Asia:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SINGAPORE -- Days after negotiators failed to wrap up an Asia trade agreement, Secretary of State John Kerry expressed confidence on Tuesday that the pact would be completed, calling it vital for the economic well-being of the region.""We made progress, good progress, in our negotiations toward one of the most significant trade agreements in history, the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" Mr. Kerry said in a speech at Singapore Management University.""No country can expect its economy to grow simply by buying and selling to its own people,"" Mr. Kerry added. ""It is just not going to happen. It defies the law of economics. Trade is a job creator and prosperity builder, period.""The trade pact has been a top priority for the Obama administration, which has proclaimed a policy of focusing more on Asia as part of a ""rebalancing"" of American interests.The White House had hoped that Congress's passage in June of ""fast track"" negotiating powers would pave the way for concluding the accord, which would be the largest regional trade pact in history.But the 12-nation talks have been snagged by differences over access to agricultural markets and protections for drug companies, among other issues. Trade ministers meeting in Hawaii failed to reach a final agreement on Friday, raising concerns that the discussions would be extended into the politically charged presidential election campaign in the United States.Mr. Kerry acknowledged in his speech that the negotiations had been tough and that there were still ""details to be hashed out,"" though he did not discuss any of the obstacles to progress or suggest how they might be overcome.Still, he said there were compelling reasons for negotiations to continue. In addition to generating jobs, he said, the accord would raise the region's standards for labor practices, discourage corruption and better protect the environment.""It will send a message to people within the T.P.P. and outside of support for good governance, transparency, accountability,"" he said, using the initials for the accord.""Every participant will have to comply with core international labor and environmental standards,"" Mr. Kerry said. ""Every participant will have to refrain from using underage workers, unsafe workplaces. Every participant will have to ensure that state-owned companies compete fairly with ones that are privately owned. And every participant will have to fight trade-related bribery and corruption, ensure free and open digital trade, and safeguard intellectual property.""Mr. Kerry said that the Obama administration was still determined to move ahead -- ""boldly,"" he said -- with its policy of focusing more on Asia. But his current round-the-world trip illustrates the challenges in trying to carry out that shift.With the United States increasingly concerned about the Islamic State, the militant group that has laid claim to much of Iraq and Syria and that has found adherents in the Sinai Peninsula and in Libya, Mr. Kerry began his trip in Egypt. As Congress reviewed the nuclear deal that the United States and five other world powers negotiated with Iran, Mr. Kerry then went to Qatar to secure support for the accord from the Arab monarchies in the Persian Gulf before arriving in Singapore on Tuesday morning.Mr. Kerry, who in his speech also endorsed Mr. Obama's clean power initiative and made an appeal to fight climate change, spoke shortly before leaving for regional meetings in Malaysia. He plans to visit Hanoi, Vietnam, on Friday to observe the 20th anniversary of the re-establishment of United States-Vietnamese diplomatic relations.",0.0

Taking an Imagined Journey With John Lennon:   [Review ],,"""Beatlebone,"" the strange and exhilarating new novel by the Irish writer Kevin Barry, is about John Lennon -- kind of. It follows him closely for around 200 pages, through a few comically calamitous days in 1978, as he travels through western Ireland to an island off its coast, bought on a lark 11 years earlier. He's nearing 40 here; past drugs, past scream therapy, far past the Beatles, and stripped raw emotionally, tired ""but not for sleeping,"" full of ""large sad warmish feelings.""A few days alone on his island, he hopes, will bring him the peace that even marriage and fatherhood, though he loves them, haven't. The poignant knowledge that this is an end-of-life crisis, not a middle-of-life one: That belongs to us, not to him.These first 200 pages are nearly perfect, observant, melancholy but not mournful, and tremendously funny, largely because John's endearingly lofty vision of his trip's purpose, a communion with nature and himself, runs immediately into very practical problems. For starters he has trouble simply finding his island; the local fixer taking care of him, a man named Cornelius who is incapable of fixing anything, doesn't have a great idea of how to get there. He tries anyway, leading his famous charge through a series of misadventures, as they dodge journalists, visit the pub in disguise and become stranded in a derelict hotel with a few holdovers from the hippie era.And then another character enters the book: Mr. Barry himself.Suddenly it's 2011, and we're inside his head as he stands ""with all the other hunched pilgrims"" outside the Dakota in New York, the apartment building where John Lennon lived and was killed. Mr. Barry realizes something. ""If I was going to make beatlebone everything it should be,"" he writes, ""I needed to get to the island."" And so he sets off.This gesture is at least as old as Laurence Sterne -- ""baring the device,"" literary critics named it nearly a century ago -- but in this context it feels startling, even risky, because ""Beatlebone"" would have been an excellent novel without it, a tender portrait of a man ""37 years along the road -- the slow-quick, slow-quick road,"" as the novel puts it in a typically lovely, darting line.And yet the risk pays off. The hallmark of Mr. Barry's previous fiction has been his remarkable gift as a stylist; in his only other novel, the much-honored ""City of Bohane,"" a slangy tale about a gang war in the near future, a glance could be a ""lamp,"" a ""check,"" a ""sconce"" -- quick-witted coinages at once low and literary, in that peculiar, flexible Irish fashion. But ""City of Bohane"" was also, in its thinner moments, filmic in the wrong ways, like a Quentin Tarantino reboot of ""West Side Story,"" its violence and lurking sentimentality correlated.""Beatlebone"" is far more profound. Mr. Barry's language is still poetic and reaching and imaginative, but now in effortless service to more substantial themes, in particular love and ""the way that time moves."" As the novel's attention alternates between Mr. Barry's real trip to the island and John's made up one, the identities of the two men -- both artists, both marked by the loss of their mothers -- mingle, until their stories begin to overlap more and more exactly, and finally the two become indivisible, ghosts of each other across the decades. The effect is beautiful, reminiscent at different moments of Virginia Woolf and Geoff Dyer, especially the ambiguous narrator of Mr. Dyer's wonderful novel ""Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi.""Yet it also leaves lingering a significant question, which is how close this book, as it moves further away from John Lennon, actually ever got us to him. Or is that the author's point: that any work about an artist is in some sense a self-investigation, and that to introduce yourself into the narrative is the most honest way to admit that?I happen to love the Beatles, so ardently that I sometimes think that if I could preserve the work of any artists from the last century, shipping it down into the care of our descendants, it would be theirs. Which means, of course, loving John Lennon.""Beatlebone"" faultlessly captures Lennon's acidic, self-loathing, yearning, weary side. (And his sense of humor, too, an essential element: ""Do you have a reservation?"" a hotel clerk asks him. ""I have severe ones,"" he replies, ""but I do need a room."") What Mr. Barry finds more elusive is the other part of John, which remained innocent enough to create the luminous songs he wrote throughout the 1970s.So when John says late in ""Beatlebone,"" ""I think we should all love and ravish each other but I'm holding out no great hopes,"" it's as if Mr. Barry really were the one speaking, with a novelist's appreciation for the complex messed-up-ness of the world. John Lennon always did seem to hold out great hopes.Even as the journeys of the author and his protagonist merge, Mr. Barry and Lennon remain stubbornly distinct. But perhaps what ultimately makes this a great novel is its author's exploration of the ways that sometimes, in art, we do get to become each other -- kind of.BeatleboneBy Kevin Barry299 pages.

Report Sees Weak Security in Cars' Wireless Systems:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Serious gaps in security and customer privacy affect nearly every vehicle that uses wireless technology, according to a report set to be released on Monday by a senator's office.The report concludes that security measures to prevent hackers from gaining control of a vehicle's electronics are ""inconsistent and haphazard,"" and that the majority of automakers do not have systems that can detect breaches or quickly respond to them.""Drivers have come to rely on these new technologies, but unfortunately the automakers haven't done their part to protect us from cyberattacks or privacy invasions,"" said the senator, Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, whose office published the report after obtaining detailed information from 16 automakers.In addition to finding ""a clear lack of appropriate security measures to protect drivers against hackers who may be able to take control of a vehicle"" or hackers who wish to ""collect and use personal driver information,"" the report expressed concerns over how automakers track drivers' behavior and collect, transmit and store that information.The report found that large amounts of data on driving histories are harvested, frequently without consumers being explicitly aware that the information is being collected or how it will be used. At least nine automakers use third-party companies to collect vehicle data, which can make consumers even more vulnerable, and some transmit that data to third-party data centers too.""This reveals that a majority of vehicle manufacturers offer features that not only record but also transmit driving history wirelessly to themselves or to third parties,"" the report said.The information collected includes where drivers have been, like physical location recorded at regular intervals, the last location they were parked, distances and times traveled, and previous destinations entered into navigation systems. A host of diagnostic data on the car is also captured.The findings in the report are based on information received from BMW, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Porsche, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo. Aston Martin, Lamborghini and Tesla did not respond to the requests.Technological innovations for vehicles are expanding rapidly: Safety features powered by radars, lasers and cameras are available in some vehicles and coming to more, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication -- in which cars can share information -- is expected to be available in the near future.At the same time, connecting cars to the Internet means that more vehicles have smartphonelike interfaces that allow for new possibilities, but also carry inherent risks.In November, two auto industry trade groups -- the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Association of Global Automakers -- tried to address consumer concerns by publishing a set of voluntary privacy principles aimed at limiting the use of vehicle data for marketing purposes. The principles called on automakers to collect information ""only as needed for legitimate business purposes.""The report says the phrase ""legitimate business purposes"" is vague enough to allow for all kinds of collection, and asserts that clear federal rules should be established for what are permissible and appropriate uses of drivers' data.Ford and Toyota declined to comment on the report. Fiat Chrysler and General Motors referred questions to the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.Wade Newton, a spokesman for the trade group, said ""automakers believe that strong consumer data privacy protections and strong vehicle security are essential to maintaining the continued trust of our customers"" and cited the November principles as a way that the industry was taking proactive steps.""Auto engineers incorporate security solutions into vehicles from the very first stages of design and production -- and security testing never stops,"" he said.Auto companies post privacy policies in their owner's manuals and on corporate websites, he said, and they ""pledge to provide heightened protections to the most sensitive types of consumer information -- protections that go beyond similar principles in other industry sectors.""",0.0
Rohingya Women Flee Violence Only to Be Sold Into Marriage:   [Foreign Desk ],,"GELUGOR, Malaysia -- The young woman had been penned in a camp in the sweltering jungle of southern Thailand for two months when she was offered a deal.She fled Myanmar this year hoping to reach safety in Malaysia, after anti-Muslim rioters burned her village. But her family could not afford the $1,260 the smugglers demanded to complete the journey.A stranger was willing to pay for her freedom, the smugglers said, if she agreed to marry him.""I was allowed to call my parents, and they said that if I was willing, it would be better for all the family,"" said the woman, Shahidah Yunus, 22. ""I understood what I must do.""She joined the hundreds of young Rohingya women from Myanmar sold into marriage to Rohingya men already in Malaysia as the price of escaping violence and poverty in their homeland.While some Rohingya women agree to such marriages to escape imprisonment or worse at the hands of smugglers, others are tricked or coerced. Some are only teenagers.Their numbers are difficult to gauge, but officials and activists estimate that in recent years hundreds, if not thousands, of Rohingya women every year have been married off this way, and that their numbers have been increasing.The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that a surge of maritime migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar this year brought an increase in ""abductions and marriages arranged without the consent of women whose passage was ultimately paid for by prospective husbands.""""Hundreds, if not thousands, of women and girls have been forced, sold or arranged for marriage via these trafficking corridors since 2012,"" said Matthew Smith, the executive director of Fortify Rights, an advocacy group in Bangkok that monitors Rohingya refugees. ""For some families, it's viewed as an imperative, as a survival mechanism.""""The trafficking gangs are treating this as a rather lucrative business,"" he said, adding that for the women and girls, ""being sold or forced into marriage is the least-worst outcome, and that's a problem.""Ms. Yunus, who now shares a house with her 38-year-old husband and 17 other Rohingyas on Penang Island, Malaysia, said she had little choice after an uncle who had promised to pay for her journey failed to do so.""I chose to marry my husband because the smugglers needed money to release me,"" she said. ""We were afraid of rape. It is better to marry a Rohingya man who can take care of us.""Sharifah Shakirah, a Rohingya refugee in Kuala Lumpur who advises refugees on resettlement, said that many of the women held by smugglers fear that if they do not find husbands quickly, ""the traffickers might sell them to do sex work"" in Thailand or India.While such trafficking is not unheard-of, it appears to be deployed more commonly as a threat than an eventuality.Some women have no say in the matter, according to Mr. Smith of Fortify Rights, which is preparing a report on marriages and human trafficking.""They don't care about anything,"" one 15-year-old girl said of her traffickers, according to notes provided by Mr. Smith. ""If someone pays money, we would have to go to them.""The young women often undertake the journeys under pressure from parents, anxious to send their daughters to safety and to reduce their domestic burdens, and are lured on by smugglers' rosy promises about the cost of the voyage and the good life that awaits them in Malaysia, Rohingyas and experts said.In reality, single women who board smugglers' ships without the means to pay become merchandise, held in a camp or aboard a ship until someone pays for their release.If the smugglers know the woman's family cannot afford the cost, ""they will inform other people and say, 'We have this woman,' "" Ms. Shakirah said.The husbands often turn out to be older and poorer than promised. Some women end up trapped in unhappy or abusive relationships.Two years ago, Ambiya Khatu, 21, married a man in Malaysia who paid $1,050 for her release from smugglers in Thailand. ""Even though he is too old for me, my mother agreed to the marriage,"" she said. ""There was nobody to rescue us, so I agreed.""In Myanmar, formerly Burma, she had hoped to study nursing and work in a hospital. Now she lives in a suburb of Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, caring for her mother, her ill sister and her sister's baby in a cramped room, while awaiting the return of her husband. He disappeared months ago, saying he was looking for work.""After being rescued, my husband asked if I wanted to marry him,"" Ms. Khatu said, her round, expressive face a palette of conflicted emotions. ""He said, 'If you don't want to marry me, you can simply pay back my money which I spent on you.' ""That was impossible.""I don't know the language, so how will I work to pay him?"" she said. ""Also, we don't have any relatives here, and I don't have any legal documentation, so there was no option for me except marriage.""Her mother, Mabiya Khatu, shook her head and murmured in disapproval. Her own husband was killed in 2012, when rioters swept into their village, leaving the family impoverished, she said. The alternative was her daughters being sold into sexual slavery, she said.""If I didn't give my daughter to him, then the traffickers might have sold her into the wrong hands,"" the mother said. ""Traffickers tried to sell both my daughters, so I got them married, and here she is in safe hands, and able to eat at least.""The younger Ms. Khatu frowned. ""I didn't like him,"" she said, ""but I had to like him.""Rohingya men who paid smugglers for brides were reluctant to discuss how the deals were struck. But a phone call recorded by investigators from Fortify Rights last September between a Rohingya woman held in a camp in Thailand and a Rohingya broker reveals the harsh calculus determining a woman's fate.""You have never married yet?"" the broker asks, according to a transcript provided by Fortify Rights.""I have never married,"" she says.The broker says that he knows an eligible man, an elderly Rohingya, willing to pay $780 for the rest of her journey to Malaysia.""Will you marry?"" the broker asks.""Yes, I will marry, if that is the will of God,"" she answers. ""We are in a difficult situation. Would you please try to take us in two or three days? We cannot get food, water, clothes, and cannot take a bath.""After the deal is made, the broker tells a guard in the camp that he needs several more single women for prospective husbands.""You can see them first,"" the guard says. ""If you want to take one or two, that is your decision.""The transactions are not always so clear-cut, however, especially given that Rohingya women come from a culture where arranged marriages are the norm. But in their villages, the women often know the prospective husbands, and they are likely to have more say in the decision.In some cases, impoverished families arrange marriages in advance to pay for a daughter's trip.Some of the women who marry to pay a smuggler's fare describe it as a choice, but Susan Kneebone, a professorial fellow at the University of Melbourne in Australia who is studying forced migration and marriage in Southeast Asia, says that these marriages amount to trafficking when violence, threats or misleading promises are used.""The idea of trafficking is really one of whether there has been an abuse of power,"" she said. ""These women actually don't have that much freedom within their own community, I suspect, and that's all made much worse by the fact that they're traveling to another country.""After anti-Muslim violence erupted in Western Myanmar in 2012, most of the refugees were men. But the number of women and children fleeing from Myanmar has risen in the past two years.One reason is the scarcity of eligible Rohingya men in Myanmar. The shortage has also raised the cost of dowries paid by the brides' families, said Chris Lewa, a Rohingya rights advocate based in Bangkok. Conversely, she said, the high ratio of Rohingya men to women in Malaysia made men there more willing to pay for a bride's journey and to forgo a dowry.This year and last year, she said, ""one can safely say that at least 5,000 young women embarked on boats and would have entered in a marriage after arriving in Malaysia.""For now, the smuggling has been paused by a regional crackdown and the rough weather of the monsoon season. But some Rohingya women are waiting for the trade to resume so they too can flee, even if the price of a ticket is marriage.Tahera Begum, 18, a Rohingya woman who had fled Myanmar a few months earlier, was staying with her sister-in-law in a makeshift camp in Kutupalong, Bangladesh, waiting to continue her journey to marry a man in Malaysia who was chosen by her brother, also in Malaysia.She had not seen a picture of the man, but they had spoken to him on the phone several times.""When I talked to him, he said he had a job, so he had an income,"" she said. ""I would have been happier if I could stay here, but my brother wanted me to get married in Malaysia.""If I get the signal from my brother or husband-to-be,"" she said, ""I will try again.""",0.0

Look Out Below!:   [House & Home/Style Desk ],,"I've occasionally been known to throw myself onto the face of a home-improvement cliff so steep that I can barely make it to the top, let alone finish with something pretty. Last week, I bailed halfway up the cliff, and the crash was gloriously, hideously ugly.But I learned something. I hope.The plan was to spruce up my ceilings with 100 feet of crown molding and roughly 200 square feet of tin panels. I sought advice from, among others, Brian Patrick Flynn, the principal designer of Flynnside Out, a Los Angeles design firm; Don Mandeville, a Home Depot district manager; and Ben Herzog, a Brooklyn-based architect.How hard could it be?Here's how hard: The tin ceiling job was an excruciating disaster. The crown molding job came out O.K., but only after being scaled down to the dimensions of a tiny bathroom.The moral of this story is that, especially with ceiling work, poor planning leads to wasted energy. Wasted energy quickly leads to fatigue. Fatigue leads to stupidity, and stupidity is how you arrive at the bottom of a cliff.The idea of refining your ceiling is a good one, Mr. Flynn said. ""Most homeowners don't realize there's more drywall space above their heads than on the walls, and when you walk into a room your eye goes immediately to the biggest empty space,"" he said.Both Mr. Flynn and Mr. Herzog favor exposed beams and, especially with older restoration projects, tin ceilings. Of the latter, Mr. Herzog said, ""It's a cool material, and it's probably easier to install than putting up a Sheetrock ceiling and painting.""I didn't hear that ""probably."" What I heard was some form of the word ""easy.""The cathedral ceiling on our sun porch is covered with ill-fitting beadboard panels that we installed a few years ago. It seemed a good candidate for tin, since we could simply nail the material to the wood. (When attaching tin to drywall, the installation is more complicated.)Tin tiles cost around $2 to $10 a square foot. We chose tiles toward the low end of that range, painted white. The tiles come in ""field"" patterns and textured border patterns that can slip beneath molding. But our sun porch has chunky molding that we hoped would cover the edges of the field pattern well enough so that we could skip the complexity of a tin border.To install, you simply lay one dimpled border atop the next so that they fit snugly, and then nail the edges into place. My contact at American Tin Ceilings, a manufacturer and online retailer of decorative tin panels, said I should place the first tile at the center and work toward the edges, using metal snips to trim the tiles to fit the outer edges. He even sent a diagram to help.I dutifully measured the beam atop our 12-foot-high cathedral ceiling and nailed the first tile in place with a $30 electric stapler that also shoots so-called brad nails.The first row of five tiles went up easily and looked relatively straight. Soon, though, the tiles stopped aligning perfectly.No big deal. Who would notice the borders separating by a hair? Besides, the longer I obsessed, the more my shoulders and neck complained.Then came the third row. The first tile fit well enough. The second, not so much. The third was O.K. Then came the fourth and fifth tiles, which looked as if they had been installed by someone with a deep hatred of geometry, an extreme fondness for vodka, or both.My shoulders and neck burned as I inspected the mess. On a hunch, I slipped a piece of molding into place to check how it looked over the high ridges of the tiles. Not great.I called my sources.My big mistake, they told me, was not starting at the very center of the ceiling. Instead, I'd laid the first tile on the westernmost edge, which, it turned out, wasn't straight. Naeem Malik, the national sales manager of retail at Armstrong Ceilings, a manufacturer of flooring and ceiling products, said that once the middle tiles are properly set, the rest fall into place.But Mr. Flynn recommended sketching a grid on the ceiling to account for every tile before starting and said that novices should expect to spend three or four weekends covering a 10-by-12-foot ceiling.If we loved the look, I might have forged ahead. But we didn't, so we returned the unused tiles for a refund and called it a day.Beer never tasted so good.>Next came the crown molding, which was easier on the body but harder on the brain.Design-wise, crown molding is usually associated with grand spaces and big budgets. And intricately carved molding can indeed command prices in the range of $20 a foot. But prices for simpler patterns and cheaper materials start at around $1 a foot, and my sources said that these moldings would work fine in less formal spaces.Mr. Flynn, for instance, said that molding that is four inches wide, or slightly less, works well with eight-foot ceilings. ""But installing it can be tricky because no room is completely straight,"" he said. ""So if you're in an older house and you know things aren't straight, it's better to leave it to your carpenter.""To which I'll add: If you're in a newer house with walls that are absolutely straight, it may still be better to leave it to your carpenter.The challenge is getting the molding to lie flat on every surface, while crafting the corners so the separate pieces perfectly abut. That requires measuring every angle, calculating the corresponding angles of the molding and cutting the material with nearly surgical precision.Mr. Mandeville, of Home Depot, said that a compound miter saw is essential equipment for the job, since it simultaneously cuts two angles. Cheaper units sell for $80, but I spent $200 on one with a laser-cutting guide, among other helpful features, and it was well worth it.Another good investment is the book ""Crown Molding and Trim: Install It Like a Pro!"" by Wayne Drake, of CompoundMiter.com, which sells the book and installation materials. I ordered a set of templates, which are physical reminders of how to place the molding in the saw before cutting it, and gauges for determining the exact angle of any given corner.The book was slightly confusing at times, but it included a huge bonus: Mr. Drake's contact information. He offers free installation advice to customers, and at least once during my installation a tip from him saved me from burying my head in a snow bank.Mr. Mandeville recommended using a partner to help install the molding, so I called my favorite victim, Bob Sr., who knows his way around a miter saw but who was equally puzzled by compound miter angles.We surveyed the living room. We looked at the miter charts. I remembered my recent debacle in the sun porch.""Want to try the bathroom first?"" I asked.""Definitely,"" he said.Even with the angle-measuring tools, the templates and Mr. Drake's live counsel, we ruined several pieces before finishing. Smartly, I had painted the pieces before cutting, but I'd foolishly bought molding made out of cheap particle board, and when I tapped one piece against a wall it broke.Four hours and many head-scratching moments later, we completed the installation. I added some spackling paste to the holes and touched up with some paint. Everything was tight and neat-looking without being too fussy.And now that I know how to measure and cut the molding, I may even try it on the whole first floor.Photograph Caulk Molding Before Installing to Close Gaps (Workforce Caulk Gun, $6.50; Dap Latex Caulk, $1.50 for 10.1-Ounce Tube).; Basic Tools Will Cover Much of a Crown Molding Job (Plumb 16-Ounce Hammer, $10).; a Power Saw Can Help with More Precise Cuts (Ridgid 10-Inch Dualbevel Miter Saw with Laser Guide, $199).; the Right Charts Eliminate Guesswork and Reduce Waste (Compoundmiter .Com Miter Table and Compound Miter Chart: $3 Each).; Left, American Tin Ceilings Pattern 13 in Speckled Oak, $17 for 24-Inch-Square Tile; Right, American Tin Ceilings Pattern 19 in Copper Brushed Bronze, $42 for 24-Inch-Square Tile.; Crown Molding Often Requires Longer Nails (Grip-Rite 10d, 3-Inch Finish Nails, $3.50 for 1-Pound Box).

Trade Deal Negotiation in Pacific Stumbles:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. LAHAINA, Hawaii -- Trade negotiators from the United States and 11 other Pacific nations failed to reach final agreement on Friday, with difficult talks on the largest regional trade agreement ever deadlocking over protections for drug companies and access to agriculture markets on both sides of the Pacific.Trade ministers, in a joint statement, said late Friday they had made ""significant progress"" and will return to their home countries to obtain high-level signoffs for a small number of final sticking points on the agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with bilateral talks reconvening soon.""There are an enormous number of issues that one works through at these talks, narrowing differences, finding landing zones,"" said Michael B. Froman, the United States trade representative. ""I am very impressed with the work that has been done. I am gratified by the progress that has been made.""Still, the breakdown is a setback for the Obama administration, which had promoted the talks here as the final round ahead of an accord that would bind 40 percent of the world's economy under a new set of rules for commerce.President Obama's trade push had been buoyed by Congress's narrow passage in June of so-called fast track trade negotiating powers, and American negotiators had hoped other countries could come together once Congress had given up the right to amend any final agreement.In the end, a deal filled with 21st-century policies on Internet access, advanced pharmaceuticals and trade in clean energy foundered on issues that have bedeviled international trade for decades: access to dairy markets in Canada, sugar markets in the United States and rice markets in Japan.""No, we will not be pushed out of this agreement,"" said a defiant New Zealand trade minister, Tim Groser, who held out for better access for his country, the largest exporter of dairy in the world.Australia, Chile and New Zealand also continue to resist the push by the United States to protect the intellectual property of major pharmaceutical companies for as long as 12 years, shielding them from generic competition as they recoup the cost of developing next-generation biologic medicines.""There's always been more than one issue,"" said Representative Sander Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who is here as an observer.The trade ministers who gathered at the luxury hotels of Maui this week for talks that went deep into the night did have some successes. They reached agreement on broad environmental protections for some of the most sensitive, diverse and threatened ecosystems on Earth, closing one of the most contentious chapters of the Pacific accord.They also reached agreement on how to label exports with distinct ""geographic indications,"" such as whether sparkling wine can be called champagne. And they agreed on a code of conduct and rules against conflicts of interest for arbitrators who would serve on extrajudicial tribunals to hear complaints from companies about whether their investments were unfairly damaged by government actions.But the failure to complete the deal -- eight years in the making -- means the next round of negotiations will push the United States ratification fight into 2016, a presidential election year. Most Republican candidates are very likely to back it, but a final agreement would force the Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton to declare her position, which she has avoided.This week, she told reporters, ""I did not work on T.P.P."" as secretary of state, although she gave a 2012 speech in Australia declaring the accord ""the gold standard in trade agreements.""The push for the Pacific deal has already split most Democrats from their president. Further delay raises the prospect that a deal sealed by President Obama might have to be ratified by his successor, just as George H. W. Bush's North American Free Trade Agreement was secured by Bill Clinton.The failure of the Maui talks pointed to the extreme difficulty of reaching agreement with so many countries, each with its own political dynamics. Vietnam, Malaysia and New Zealand were willing to make significant concessions to gain access to United States markets.But with Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, fighting for his political life ahead of national elections in October, Canada would not budge on opening its poultry and dairy markets.Chile, with a new, left-of-center government and existing free trade agreements with each of the countries in the Pacific deal, including the United States, saw no reason to compromise, especially on its demand for a short window of protection for United States pharmaceutical giants.Australia's delegation insisted that pharmaceutical market protections beyond five years would never get through Parliament, and the United States team was demanding 12.Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico's secretary of economy, was defiant on the hard line he took against the export of Japanese cars with any less than 65 percent of their parts from T.P.P. countries. ""I am fighting for the interests of my country,"" he said.The bright spot might have been the environmental negotiations. The completed environmental chapter would cover illegal wildlife trafficking, forestry management, overfishing and marine protection, and it could prove to be a landmark, setting a new floor for all future multilateral accords.""As centers of biodiversity, T.P.P. countries cover environmentally sensitive regions from tundra to island ecosystems, and from the world's largest coral reefs to its largest rain forest,"" reads a summary of the environment chapter, obtained by The New York Times. ""T.P.P.'s Environment chapter addresses these challenges in detail.""Under the agreement, the 12 countries -- from Peru and its rain forest to Vietnam and the diverse Mekong Delta -- must commit to obeying existing wildlife trafficking treaties and their own environmental laws. Environmentally destructive subsidies, such as cheap fuel to power illegal fishing vessels and governmental assistance for boat making in overfished waters, are banned.The chapter singles out the ""long-term conservation of species at risk,"" such as sea turtles, sea birds and marine mammals and ""iconic marine species such as whales and sharks.""Failure to comply would subject a signatory to the same government-to-government compliance procedures as any other issue covered by the trade agreement, potentially culminating in trade sanctions. United States negotiators hope that just the threat of economic sanctions will bolster relatively weak environmental ministries in countries like Peru, Malaysia and Vietnam.Some environmental groups, and many Democrats in Congress, are very likely to be dissatisfied. They complain that agreeing to a series of ""obligations"" falls short of ""requirements."" The Sierra Club has complained that the United States has not pursued trade remedies against countries obliged to environmental enforcement under existing accords, such as the United States-Peru free trade deal.But most major environmental groups remained circumspect, or cautiously optimistic, until they could read the details.""Negotiators have accomplished much, but the hard work is far from over,"" said David McCauley, senior vice president for policy at the World Wildlife Fund. ""Individual nations now must live up to their T.P.P. conservation obligations, including putting in place effective measures to ensure that they are responsible traders in wildlife and products provided by our forests and oceans.""The impact of the Pacific accord's environmental chapter could be broad, both for the nations in the deal and those outside. The 12 participating countries account for more than a quarter of the global seafood trade and about a quarter of the world's timber and pulp production. Five of the countries rank among the world's most biologically diverse countries.Some, like Vietnam and Malaysia, have long been on the watch list for illegal wildlife trafficking, such as the illicit trade in rhino horns. Japan has long been scrutinized for its treatment of whales and dolphins. The World Bank has estimated that as much as 80 percent of Peru's logging exports are harvested illegally.Under the terms of the new accord, member countries would be required to strengthen port inspections and document checks, a provision that could expand the scope of the deal beyond the 12 countries. Illegal wildlife and timber harvests bound for countries like China go through ports of the 12 countries. And countries in the deal are required to take action if they discover contraband that has been harvested illegally, even if the product is not illegal in their country.Negotiators say they substantially narrowed the number of outstanding issues. They vowed to keep the momentum going. But, as one non-United States official said, if talks go into hiatus for long, it could be easier for many of the countries to say no than yes.",0.0
Concern Mixes With Trust Issues for a Troubled Jet:   [Sports Desk ],,"FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- The first eight minutes of Coach Todd Bowles's news conference on Friday were devoted to a subject he had thought he would not have to address again. Willie Colon answered questions about it, as did Brandon Marshall and Damon Harrison.For the third consecutive day, the Jets were forced to discuss the questionable decision-making of one of their best players, defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson. His latest embarrassing episode -- not the four-game suspension levied last month for violating the N.F.L.'s substance-abuse policy -- involved being charged with resisting arrest and numerous traffic violations after the police in Missouri said they had clocked him driving at 143 miles per hour, an incident that could extend his absence from the playing field beyond Week 5.When Richardson reported to work on Friday, he encountered an atmosphere tinged with compassion but also suspicion. As concerned as the Jets are about Richardson's health and welfare, they also cannot count on him as much as before the latest incident. Richardson had to apologize to his teammates and coaches, again, and later he was brought in front of the news media to explain his transgressions, again. The Jets' trust in him has eroded, and he knows it.""I let them down,"" Richardson said. ""Simple as that.""The Jets are still trying to determine what Richardson was thinking on July 14 -- 12 days after his suspension was announced -- when, according to the police, he raced his Bentley at outrageous speeds with a loaded handgun beneath the driver's seat floor mat, a 12-year-old in the back seat and what officers called a ""very strong odor"" of marijuana wafting through the car.Richardson has not been charged with any violations related to the gun or the marijuana or with child endangerment. Tim Lohmar, the prosecuting attorney for St. Charles County in Missouri, said in a telephone interview Friday that he could say ""with a reasonable degree of certainty"" that Richardson would not be charged any further.When Richardson met with Bowles, he explained what had transpired that night, and Bowles said Richardson sounded remorseful. But Richardson did not disclose why he had concealed his arrest from the team.""You lose a lot of trust,"" Bowles said. ""Like I said, actions speak louder than words. As a man, you have to own up to what you've done.""Richardson, a popular figure in the locker room, did not confide in any of his teammates. Nor did he tell his parents, he said, who found out about his arrest through news reports.""It's hard to say a guy's a good guy when two things like this happen,"" Bowles said. ""But he's a good guy. But good guys don't always do the right things.""Bowles added: ""Right now I'm just worried about getting him the help; he needs the help. I'm not even worried about the football player. Like I said, we can win without him. It would probably be more fun with him, but we're prepared to win without him. The biggest thing is working on him getting better as a person.""Several times on Friday, Bowles alluded to Richardson's having a ""problem"" and said that the Jets would try to help him. Asked what that problem was, Bowles said he was not certain but that he was troubled and disappointed by the quick succession of the incidents.""The way I handle my business, I just always handle it on my own,"" Richardson said. ""Just wasn't smart.""Calling it a pending legal matter, Richardson did not share many details with the news media about what happened on July 14. After alluding Thursday to feeling depressed, he acknowledged that he had been rattled by a death in the family. Richardson called it ""just one bad night.""""I thought it would be fun to show my family members something,"" he said. ""They never rode in a car like that before.""Richardson is permitted to practice during training camp and to play in preseason games, but he cannot be on the active roster until Oct. 5, the day after they play Miami in London.The N.F.L. will investigate whether he violated its personal conduct policy, which is separate from the substance abuse program, and it is possible that Richardson could be facing an additional suspension.Richardson, who could be facing a year in prison for his Class A misdemeanor, is to be arraigned on Aug. 31, and he said he hoped the league would wait until he had gone through the justice system before reaching its decision. If Richardson were to plead not guilty, Lohmar said, a trial would be set in six to eight months.""We just want the best for Sheldon,"" Colon said. ""It's not about how we feel at the end of the day. It's his career, it's his lifestyle that's kind of out there. We want him to just be a better person off the field.""That is Bowles's primary concern, as well, but he is also trying to build a team and return the Jets to the playoffs after a four-year absence. He wants Richardson to be part of it.""That's up to him,"" Bowles said. ""That'll all depend on the next couple weeks, days and months go by and whether he gets the message and how it turns his life around. We're here for him. We're trying to help him out.""EXTRA POINTSThe Jets' rookie receiver Devin Smith is expected to miss most of training camp after breaking ribs on Friday, the team said. He was being held in the hospital overnight as a precaution. The Jets did not say how Smith had sustained the injury, but he was slow to get up after an acrobatic catch during practice and was escorted inside for examination.Photograph The Jets' Sheldon Richardson, Who has Been Charged with Resisting Arrest, with Reporters On Friday.

Spinoff Strategy Bears Fruit for IAC:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"Pop quiz. Which company has created more value for shareholders over the last two decades: Disney, Microsoft or IAC/InterActiveCorp?If you guessed Disney or Microsoft, as most people do, you'd be wrong.The correct answer is IAC, Barry Diller's hodgepodge of Internet businesses that has long lived in the shadow of tech behemoths like Amazon and Facebook.Mr. Diller, the colorful media mogul turned early Internet evangelist, has somewhat accidentally built a unique business model: Buy digital businesses, fold them into a conglomerate and then spin out the most successful ones, like the Match Group, the online dating company that had its initial public offering last Thursday after being carved out of IAC. Match now has a market value of about $3.7 billion.In 2008, Mr. Diller began a grand experiment of breaking up IAC, which is based in New York. There's Expedia, TripAdvisor (a spinoff of Expedia), Ticketmaster, LendingTree, Interval Leisure Group, HSN and now Match. At the time, IAC was considered by some to be suffering under what skeptics called the ""Diller Discount."" A 2006 Barron's article, ""Barry Diller's Dilemma,"" argued that IAC's assets were vastly undervalued as a conglomerate, but even when he began to split the company up, the stocks of the spinoffs initially underperformed.But today, the numbers tell a different story.If you invested $1,000 in IAC in August 1995 when Mr. Diller began the business -- at the cusp of the dot-com boom (and subsequent bust) -- you'd have about $16,000 today, assuming you reinvested dividends and held on to shares of the various companies spun off from IAC. By comparison, if you invested $1,000 in a fund that tracked the Nasdaq index, you'd have about $4,800 today. In other words, you would have done more than three times better with Mr. Diller.""I had no idea in my head,"" Mr. Diller said in an interview, when asked whether he set out to create this unusual business model from the outset. ""Everything that I've ever done is one foot in front of the other.""But he said he did recognize that IAC could act as a sort of ""central flywheel"" to create, buy and finance companies to later be spun out. It occurred to him, he said, when he was talking to the chief executive of Ticketmaster, which was then a wholly owned company of IAC in the mid-2000s.""I first realized it"" when the unit's chief executive ""came into my office and said that he wanted to spend money on technology and that he wanted approval,"" Mr. Diller said, because the investment would reduce operating profits by half. ""I said, 'So you mean I'm like your daddy and you're coming to ask me permission to do this thing?""'It was at that moment, Mr. Diller said, that he decided the business would be better off as a stand-alone entity in the public market. ""If you were on your own,"" he told the chief executive, ""do you really think you'd go out in one year and take your operating income in half with nothing else to say about it?"" Mr. Diller added: ""That night I thought, 'You know what? The shining light should not be shielded. The guy's actions should be subject to real-world conditions rather than the false condition of being inside this so-to-speak capital-allocated company.""And so began what has turned IAC into a minifactory of spinoffs. ""I'm really an anti-conglomerateur,"" Mr. Diller said.He is not the only media chief executive whose anti-conglomerateur tactics have paid off. Three other companies that have aggressively spun off assets -- Dish Network, Time Warner and Liberty Media -- performed even better in the stock market than IAC.And it is a business strategy, Wall Street analysts say, that might be deployed by that other Internet giant, Google, which recently reorganized its corporate structure. Earlier this year, Google changed its name to Alphabet and reorganized the company to give its many divisions more independence from its dominant search and advertising business. Alphabet's founders have said they intend to keep all of the divisions as part of the company, but it's only logical that Alphabet could one day spin off Google Life Sciences or its Nest Labs home products unit.Unlike the Google guys, Mr. Diller did not start IAC in a garage. In 1995, after a successful Hollywood career, Mr. Diller struck out on his own, acquiring a 20 percent controlling interest in Silver King Communications for $10 million. Silver King was a small media company, but it broadcast the Home Shopping Network, which became his vehicle to make acquisitions, eventually renaming the entire company as HSN. In 2004, it became IAC/InterActiveCorp, which, at least in architecture circles, is best known for its Frank Gehry-designed headquarters along the West Side Highway in Chelsea.Invariably, skeptics say that all of these restructurings and spinoffs are nothing more than financial prestidigitation. So I put the question to Mr. Diller: Isn't this not so much a business model as it is a bunch of paper shuffling? Shouldn't all these businesses have the same value, together or apart?""It's the opposite of paper shuffling,"" Mr. Diller snapped back, somewhat outraged by the question. ""It is the total distribution of shares in a multibusiness company into a successive number of independent companies, some of which may be controlled or not, but that's not the issue."" These companies, he said, ""are under the scrutiny of a set of shareholders only wanting to own that business. I think that's very healthy.""In Mr. Diller's view, spinning out a business imposes a discipline and focus that it might lack inside a conglomerate. In some cases, it's hard to argue with Mr. Diller's point. In 2012, Expedia, which had already been spun off from IAC, spun off its popular travel guide site, TripAdvisor. Today, TripAdvisor is worth more than $12 billion on its own. (Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Expedia, is a director of The New York Times Company.)""Nothing fundamental changed,"" Mr. Diller said, except that TripAdvisor was public and had to swim on its own. ""The result of it was of course that TripAdvisor was a much better company.""Still, despite all the carving out and spinning off, IAC remains a monolith of some 150 digital brands including Ask.com, About.com, Vimeo, Collegehumor.com, Dictionary.com and The Princeton Review. Just two weeks ago, IAC made a hostile bid for Angie's List, a repository of online reviews for home repairs and other services. In its letter to Angie's List's board, IAC said it would consider combining Angie's List with its HomeAdvisor business. Hmm. Sounds as if Mr. Diller is shopping for his next spinoff.Photograph Barry Diller at a Tribeca Film Festival Party This Year. In 2008, He Began Breaking Up His Company, Iac/Interactivecorp.

Fair Wages for Uber Drivers:   [Letter ],,"To the Editor:Re ""Uber Case Highlights Outdated Worker Protection Laws"" (DealBook, Sept. 16):Our workplace laws need updating, but not for the reasons the article states. Having a say over hours, or the option to quit if conditions are bad, does not convert workers into entrepreneurs who can forgo basic protections like minimum wage.Moved by Uber's and Lyft's lofty promises, one Seattle driver, Takele Gobena, borrowed money to buy a car that met company requirements and began driving 55 hours weekly. His earnings, after expenses, amounted to $2.65 an hour. Sure, he could quit, but he owed $8,500 on the car that drove his bosses' profits.We should update our workplace laws -- to ensure that workers like Mr. Gobena can work for a fair wage and a better life, no matter what their classification or their bosses' claims about what they want. We'd all benefit if these innovative companies stopped battling every attempt to improve working conditions and instead honed a business model that doesn't rely on a cheap, unprotected work force.SARAH LEBERSTEIN>New YorkThe writer is a senior staff attorney with the National Employment Law Project and co-author of its report ""Rights on Demand: Ensuring Workplace Standards and Worker Security in the On-Demand Economy.""Company / organization: Name: Uber Technologies Inc; NAICS: 511210, 518210",0.0
The Case for Aid to Central America:   [Editorial ],,"There are two important policy debates in Washington that deal with the vexing problem of illegal immigration. One is being approached intelligently; the other is decidedly not.The first debate involves the Obama administration's request for $1 billion in next year's budget for development programs in Central America, a funding level that would roughly triple the assistance Washington currently contributes to the region.If the administration succeeds in significantly ramping up aid to Central America, it stands a much better chance of meaningfully tackling the root causes of instability that over the decades have led thousands of people to embark on dangerous journeys to the United States searching for a better life.The second debate is about the budget of the Department of Homeland Security. Republicans offered to allocate funding for the department, which includes the agencies that handle immigration benefits and enforce immigration laws, on the condition that the Obama administration's program to shield certain immigrants from deportation be scrapped. Democratic lawmakers have pushed back.If a funding bill is not passed by the end of this month, when the department's current budget expires, the Republicans will have accomplished little more than placating the conservative base of the party by blocking a presidential initiative they wrongly characterize as amnesty. The Obama administration has rightly threatened to veto any funding bill that would undo the reprieve the administration has extended to some long-term immigrants.The debate over unauthorized immigration is polarizing and complex, and under the best of circumstances, the issue will take many years to address meaningfully. But Republicans who would shortchange the Homeland Security Department should pause in their reflexive assault and consider the merits of the White House's long-term approach. They also should recognize that they would deservedly be blamed if Homeland Security agencies are ill-equipped to respond to natural disasters or other calamities in the months ahead because of lack of funding.Many leaders in Latin America have come to view the United States over the past decade as a largely disengaged neighbor whose foreign policy attention span has been consumed by crises outside the hemisphere. Although the underlying causes of the wave of unaccompanied minors that rushed to the United States in 2014 were years in the making, the influx took Washington largely by surprise.As American officials began exploring ways to stem the flow, they found a surprising, if uneven, level of cooperation from the leaders of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, the three countries where a vast majority of the children came from. Government officials there were persuaded to accept a higher number of repatriated kids and helped dispel the notion that anyone who managed to sneak into the United States would be allowed to stay.Then, when the number of people apprehended at the border became more manageable, the Obama administration began contemplating the type of political and economic reforms that could, over time, make the prospect of migrating to the United States less appealing. It concluded that greater cooperation among countries in a region rived by rivalries and uneasy relations among leaders was key. In addition, the poorer countries in Central America must invest in their education systems and make their economies more attractive to foreign investors.It will take far more than $1 billion in American aid to accomplish those goals. But an infusion of aid would give the United States more leverage in pressing Central American leaders to take initial steps, some of which would come at a political cost domestically. It also would most likely lead to stronger cooperation on other critical transnational problems like drug trafficking, criminal networks and climate change. Having greater influence in the region, which continues to reel from the repercussions of American military interventions in the 1980s, would be sensible at a time when Russia and China are making significant economic inroads in Latin America.In selling the initiative to members of Congress, Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. has argued that the costs of dealing with continuing large waves of migrants, if security and poverty worsen in the region, will almost certainly exceed the kind of investment the White House has proposed. No one who has carefully studied the history of Central America would disagree with that.",0.0
"Passion Play Endures, and Italians Become More Than Merely Players:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SORDEVOLO, Italy -- The horses were skittish. The microphones occasionally went silent or screeched shrilly. Phones in the audience trilled a little too often.But by and large, the amateur performance of ""The Passion of Christ"" here on a cool June evening went off without a hitch, the townspeople taking to their roles with considerable verve.Three times a week until late September, rain or shine, the residents of this small Piedmont town will re-enact t he Passion, the final days of Jesus' life, just as their parents did before them, and their parents, and their parents.More than half of the town's 1,300 residents are involved in the production in one guise or another. About 400 tread the boards -- sand, actually -- of a stage that hundreds of others have worked on for months, recreating a small-scale Jerusalem at the foot of the Alps. This year, the youngest actor is 3, the oldest 72.""It's an obsession in Sordevolo,"" said Celestino Fogliano, the current director of the Passion, which is performed here every five years, consuming the town for the play's run and many months before. ""It's in our DNA.""This year is the play's 200th anniversary in the town.Like most of Sordevolo's residents, Mr. Fogliano, an engineer, boasts a prestigious Passion pedigree, having started as a 5-year-old angel in the 1960 performance, then graduating to speaking parts.""I am a former Christ,"" he said, adding that the lead role was ""a family thing."" His great-grandfather played Jesus in 1870, and his son played Jesus in a children's version.Yes, there is a children's version of Christ's agony, the town's spring training camp for a tradition that remains very much alive despite Europe's shift toward greater secularism, which is palpable through declining church attendance in Italy.Passion plays continue throughout Europe, though the fortunes of this form of popular piety have ebbed since it was introduced in medieval times. Just last month, 90 Passion groups from 15 European countries met in Sordevolo for the 31st annual Europassion conference.Most Passion plays are linked to the week leading up to Easter, but in Sordevolo, the ritual gradually migrated to later in the spring, and then summer for an extended run.The text used for Sordevolo's Passion was written in the 15th century, and scholars still do not agree on how it arrived here. Though the story it recounts is familiar to many, the language is ornate and difficult to follow, even for some native Italian speakers.""We act with our hearts more than technique, but the value is in its popular nature,"" said Guido Galassi, a workplace-security expert by day and the actor portraying the Good Thief by night. Most Sordevolo residents know the text by heart, he added.A procession along the town's main street precedes each performance, and residents line the sidewalks to cheer on their neighbors. Devotion to Sordevolo's Passion remains strong even among people who move away.This is the second time that Marco Caldi, a surfing and scuba-diving instructor who plays Jesus, has returned to his hometown from Bali, Indonesia, where he has lived for the past six years, to take part in the Passion despite an almost paralyzing stage fright.""I've been attacked by 10-meter sharks, and I've been tossed around in storms, but that's nothing compared to the fear I feel in front of the public,"" Mr. Caldi said. ""The only time I really relax is when I die on the cross.""Over the years, Sordevolo has heightened its showmanship with grander sets, more elaborate choreography involving charging horses, and the construction in 2004 of a 2,400-seat amphitheater to keep spectators out of the rain.It is the town's way of measuring up to the production re-enacted every 10 years since 1634 in Oberammergau, Germany, which is by all accounts the brightest star of the genre. That Passion can run as long as eight hours with a three-hour break for a meal. Sordevolo's productions barely top two or three hours, with no intermission.""Oberammergau is a whole other ballgame,"" said Carlo Pedrazzo, the president of the Popular Theater Association of Sordevolo, which finances and coordinates the Passion and is the heir of the committees of residents that have been running the show since 1850. ""It's big business; we know that goal is far away.""Other locals point out, not always kindly, that Oberammergau's residents are paid to take part and that profits are divided at the end of the run. In Sordevolo, the only paid actors are the 14 horses used by the Romans to periodically charge across the stage, and the profits are used for charity.That said, Sordevolo admires how Oberammergau has been able to market its Passion, which drew about 500,000 visitors to its most recent staging, in 2010. Sordevolo's brought in 40,000.That same year, the Popular Theater Association of Sordevolo entered into a partnership with an American tour operator to increase foreign visitors, and so far, nearly 40 American groups have booked tickets for this year's shows.""It's not about the money,"" Mr. Galassi said. ""It's about making the Passion known outside Italy.""Money from tourists, local officials say, could also help offset the crisis that Sordevolo and surrounding towns have been facing since the textile industry that propped up the local economy took a downturn a few years ago.""The textile industry is dying, so we invested in culture,"" said Sordevolo's mayor, Riccardo Lunardon. ""We said let the Passion grow, and with it the town will grow.""Over the years, the city transformed a number of abandoned homes into bed-and-breakfasts, and a museum was created to house artifacts of past Passions.In off years, the Passion amphitheater is used for concerts. It has also become the site of an annual international motorcycle rally, which this year was titled ""Blood, Sweat, Beer, and Rock 'n' Roll.""Though the local church has always given its benediction to Sordevolo's Passion, the play is very much a civic affair. ""The parish has always been marginal; this was set up as a lay institution,"" Mr. Pedrazzo said. ""People aren't chosen to participate because they go to church.""In fact, casting is the only ""delicate moment"" of the entire process, when the town's acclaimed harmony is put to the test.""Gossip is part of the history of the Passion,"" Mr. Pedrazzo said diplomatically.Photograph The Cast After an Amateur Performance of ""the Passion of Christ"" in Sordevolo, Italy, in June.

Spartans Stun Buckeyes With a Late Field Goal:   [Sports Desk ],,"COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Michael Thomas and Jalin Marshall, Ohio State's best wide receivers, both had inexplicable drops on what should have been simple throw-and-catches against Michigan State on Saturday. The drops came on two of the staggering six three-and-out drives the No. 2 Buckeyes had.It is difficult to say whether catching the ball would have even mattered. Wherever an Ohio State player was, a Michigan State defender was there to stop him. The result was grinding, sleet-soaked trench warfare in which the No. 9 Spartans, even without their starting quarterback, Connor Cook, played their best game of the year and upset the Buckeyes, 17-14. The victory came on a 41-yard field goal by Michael Geiger, a junior, as time expired -- along with, in all likelihood, the Buckeyes' aspirations of repeating as national champions.Michigan State (10-1, 6-1 Big Ten) now controls its destiny, so that a win next Saturday at home against Penn State would send it to face Iowa on Dec. 5 in Indianapolis for the conference championship game. A win there would make the Spartans likely, if not guaranteed, contenders in the College Football Playoff.Ohio State (10-1, 6-1) faces a more dire postseason picture. To have a shot at the Hawkeyes and the Playoff, not only does it need to win at Michigan next Saturday -- something the Spartans barely managed -- but Michigan State would need to lose.Buckeyes Coach Urban Meyer said he had trouble thinking about the prospect of repeating as national champion: ""Oh, boy, we've got to get a couple of first downs and start finding a way to complete a pass and beat our rival,"" he said, referring to Michigan.The Buckeyes, undefeated and playing at home, were the clear favorites Saturday. As it became increasingly likely that Cook, who injured his shoulder in last week's 24-7 win over Maryland, might not play, oddsmakers set the line at two touchdowns.Michigan State -- used to feeling overlooked in favor of Michigan -- exploited the chip everyone else seemed to place on its shoulder.""We sat around all day and listened to how we were underdogs,"" Coach Mark Dantonio said.Michigan State center Jack Allen added, in reference to two Ohio State defensive linemen: ""I read somewhere someone said we couldn't stop Joey Bosa or Adolphus Washington. I didn't see them back there too much today.""Michigan State quarterbacks Damion Terry, a redshirt sophomore, and Tyler O'Connor, a junior, entered Saturday's game with a combined 63 pass attempts in their college careers.Yet they traded duties admirably on Saturday. O'Connor was 7 of 12 for 89 yards, Terry 1 of 4 for 2 yards. Though Michigan State used some misdirection and some designed runs, particularly for the more mobile Terry -- who rushed for 25 yards -- it more often ran a modest version of the pro-style offense that Dantonio has favored.The rain, which started minutes before kickoff and turned harder as the temperature fell, made passing less of an option anyway.""We like that nasty weather,"" said Shilique Calhoun, a Michigan State defensive end.The Spartans' first touchdown, in the second quarter, came after O'Connor hit wide receiver Aaron Burbridge for 36 yards and running back Gerald Holmes ran twice, for 9 and 7 yards, setting up a 12-yard touchdown pass from O'Connor to fullback Trevon Pendleton.Ohio State committed four penalties for 20 yards, not including a declined pass-interference call on the 36-yard Burbridge completion. Its defense did not play like the highly ranked unit it is, giving up 294 total yards and forcing just one turnover from two inexperienced quarterbacks.That turnover came when Bosa sacked Terry and Sam Hubbard forced a fumble. The Buckeyes recovered at the Michigan State 32-yard line, and it led to Ezekiel Elliott's 1-yard touchdown run on fourth-and-goal with 12 minutes 45 seconds left in the second quarter.But Bosa, who is projected to go high in next year's N.F.L. draft, also committed three offside penalties, including one on a Michigan State fourth-and-8 in the fourth quarter on a 75-yard drive that culminated with a two-yard touchdown run by Gerald Holmes to tie the game at 14-14 with 12:03 remaining.It was telling that the only turnovers -- Terry's fumble and a muffed punt reception late in the third quarter by Michigan State's Macgarrett Kings Jr. -- led to the only two drives Ohio State started in Spartans territory and, in turn, Ohio State's only two scores.Ohio State entered the day averaging more than 36 points per game, but Michigan State's defense held the Buckeyes to 132 total yards. Quarterback J. T. Barrett went 9 of 12 for 46 yards.Meyer blamed himself, saying he was ""not content"" with the play calling. Elliott, a junior running back and a strong contender for the Heisman Trophy who ran for 33 yards on 12 carries, questioned the play calling after the game.Both Elliott and Cardale Jones -- who started at quarterback during Ohio State's championship run last year and for the majority of this season -- indicated after the game that they would leave after this season, presumably for the N.F.L.Ohio Stadium set a record with an announced crowd of 108,975. O'Connor said he had played here once before, in a high school all-star game. A native of Lima, Ohio, he seemed to speak for several Spartans from Ohio with grudges to bear, including Cook, Pendleton and Geiger.Ohio State, O'Connor said, had contacted him just once during the recruitment process -- as a punter.Photograph Michael Geiger (4) After Kicking the Winning Field Goal for Michigan State As Time Expired.

G.O.P. Candidates and Mass Shootings:   [Editorial ],,"Despite the repeated horror of mass shootings in churches, movie theaters and schoolrooms, the Republican candidates running for president are remarkably quiet about how they would deal with this most pressing public health challenge.""We define gun control real simple -- that's hitting what you aim at,"" Senator Ted Cruz of Texas told a political gathering in New Hampshire earlier this year, typifying the level of pandering by the Republican field to the gun lobby.In contrast, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, is taking up the gun control issue once more, 15 years after the defeat of Al Gore left her party leaders swearing off the subject as a losing cause. ""We have to take on the gun lobby,"" Mrs. Clinton told a New Hampshire crowd last month. ""This is a controversial issue. I am well aware of that. But I think it is the height of irresponsibility not to talk about it.""Tell that to the Republican candidates staunchly opposed to gun safety laws, like limits on ammunition used in the rapid-fire, battlefield-type weapons favored by mass shooters and a ban on unregistered weapon sales by dealers at gun shows. Mass shootings involving three or more murder victims have been on the rise in recent years, according to federal data, while gun production has more than doubled since 2008.Republican candidates prefer to focus on the mental health of mass shooters as the decisive issue, not easy gun access, as if both issues should not be forcefully pursued by sensible public leaders.After the recent shooting deaths at a Louisiana movie theater by a man who obtained his gun out of state, Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican presidential candidate, proudly pointed to his state's recently joining the federal watch list that attempts to track mentally troubled people who should be denied guns. But his state had ignored the list for years and remains one of the lowest in spending on mental health care. After the shootings, Mr. Jindal proposed that gun owners be allowed to bring their weapons to movie theaters.While short on sensible gun safety prescriptions, the Republican candidates are quite precise in disclosing the types of pistols and rifles they proudly own. According to The Washington Post, Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio prefer .357 magnum revolvers; Donald Trump has a Heckler & Koch .45; Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina owns an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, and so forth, for a total of at least 40 guns among 15 candidates.The survey found two non-gun owners: Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has been busy on the hustings scrambling back from his state's strong gun safety laws (""There would be a whole list of things I would change,"" he said), and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, who signed the reckless Stand Your Ground law that has been used to reduce gun owners' culpability in shootings.Mr. Bush, rated A-plus by the National Rifle Association, said in his 2003 declaration to N.R.A. conventioneers: ""The sound of our guns is the sound of freedom!""",0.0

For the singer Anita Darian, getting to Carnegie Hall not only took practice; it also took a kazoo.Her versatile voice carried her there in 1960, where she sang and played kazoo with the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein's baton. But Ms. Darian reached far more listeners with her keening, uncredited background singing on the Tokens' 1961 hit ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight.""She died on Feb. 1 at 87 in Oceanside, N.Y. Lynda Wells, a longtime friend and an executor of her estate, said the cause was complications after intestinal surgery.Ms. Darian was a session singer and stage performer when she was asked by the producers Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore and the songwriter George David Weiss to provide backing vocals for ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight,"" which Mr. Weiss had adapted from a South African song.Ms. Darian's high-pitched vocal -- at one point soaring over the lines ""In the jungle,/ the mighty jungle/ The lion sleeps tonight"" -- provided a memorable counterpoint to the lead vocal and the harmonized lower-register refrain ""A-wimoweh-a-wimoweh."" The record spent three weeks atop the Billboard pop chart.Ms. Darian also sang behind Mickey & Sylvia on their 1957 hit ""Love Is Strange"" and recorded with Burt Bacharach, Dinah Washington, Patti Page and others, usually without credit and often emulating the eerie sound of a theremin.Her talents were more frequently acknowledged onstage.

U.S. and French Responses to Refugees:   [Letter ],,"To the Editor:Re ""Bill to Restrict Syrians in U.S. Passes in House"" (front page, Nov. 20):The same Congress that has not acted on President Obama's request to authorize military action against ISIS was all too eager to act against its victims -- Syrians fleeing death or enslavement.Make no mistake about it, the hysteria surrounding Syrian refugees, reflected in this legislation, is a victory for ISIS.One of the primary goals of terrorism is to scare individuals and governments into inaction or overreaction, thereby validating the power and legitimacy of the terrorists.

The recent terrorist attacks in Paris were a horrific tragedy, but they should not be used as the basis for rapidly expanding mass surveillance programs without due consideration and public debate, where possible, about the proper balance between national security concerns and privacy and civil liberties.As the 9/11 Commission aptly noted in recommending the creation of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, the choice between security and liberty is a false one; if our liberties are curtailed, we lose the values that we struggle to defend.Our relatively new, independent, bipartisan agency can be a critical part of the solution to the problem you have identified, and as chairman I am cognizant that our mission has never been more critical.The extension of existing surveillance programs or creation of new ones can be important in preventing future attacks, but such programs must safeguard the constitutional rights that Americans hold so dear.The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board is uniquely situated to examine these programs and will continue pursuing its mission of providing in-depth, informed analysis to the president, Congress and the public.DAVID MEDINEWashington",0.0
"Stocks, Especially of Banks, Sink in Greece as Athens Market Reopens:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"ATHENS -- Investors issued a vote of no confidence in Greece's economy on Monday, dumping stocks as trading on the Athens exchange resumed for the first time in five weeks.A plunge of more than 16 percent for the main Greek index and a 30 percent sell-off for bank stocks were the latest signs of Greece's shattered economy. But the resumption of trading was a necessary step as Greece tries to emerge from controls on financial activity that the government, confronted with a bank run, imposed at the end of June.Analysts said stock prices could begin to recover in the weeks to come, bringing much-needed capital into the country, as investors with an appetite for risk look for bargains.In yet another sign of trouble, though, new survey data on Monday showed a fall in Greek manufacturing activity since the government imposed controls in late June on the flow of money out of Greece.Much depends on the outcome of negotiations between government officials and representatives of the country's international creditors on a multibillion-euro bailout, Greece's third in five years. The talks entered a second week on Monday.""If the new deal with creditors is struck and ratified, Greek stocks could rebound nicely,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said in an email. ""And if the deal then actually holds, with Greece implementing the structural reforms demanded by creditors, Greece could recover strongly.""He added: ""That is a big if.""After initial talks with foreign envoys on Friday that focused on Greece's finances, privatization of public assets and bank recapitalization, Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said that ""there was convergence on some points, less on others.""The stock exchange had been closed since the end of June, when the government also shut banks in an effort to prevent more money from leaving the country after talks with creditors collapsed. Banks reopened on July 20, but restrictions on money transfers and withdrawals remain in force.The resumption of trading in Athens was intended to be another step toward normalcy, but instead, investors used the opportunity to flee exposure to the Greek economy.Shares on the exchange initially dropped nearly 23 percent as trading began on Monday, with bank stocks leading the rout. While the main index recovered somewhat by the end of trading, bank shares did not. They might have fallen even more on Monday, but selling was halted after the declines reached 30 percent, in accordance with Athens stock exchange rules.Banking has been among the hardest-hit sectors of the Greek economy, and lenders are dependent on emergency cash from the European Central Bank to stay afloat.Greek shares recovered slightly by closing and were down 16 percent, but the initial price declines showed that most investors were not yet willing to bet on the country again.Bank stocks ""will fall quite a bit more and will take a while to rebound,"" said Nikos Pantelakis, chief executive of Pantelakis Securities, an Athens brokerage firm.Mr. Pantelakis said that shares of companies outside the financial industry, like the telecom company OTE, Aegean Airlines or the betting firm OPAP ""will recover faster.""",0.0
Bill Blocking Plan to Reduce Mute Swans Is Vetoed:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. It was always destined to bring public relations misery: a state agency's campaign, approved by experts but undeniably unpleasant, to exterminate the lithe-necked, snow-white mute swans of New York State, in the name of ecological health.To judge by the commotion that greeted the announcement nearly two years ago, and that has bedeviled the State Department of Environmental Conservation ever since, the agency might just as well have marked out butterflies or kittens for mass murder.But in the dispute between those who see mute swans as an invasive species and those who question the science behind that label, the nadir did not arrive until Monday, when a state senator suggested the mute swans were the innocent victims of a hazy political conspiracy.""There's something else going on here, in my opinion,"" the senator, Tony Avella, a Democrat from Queens, said in an interview, two days after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo vetoed a bill Mr. Avella sponsored that would have halted the state's culling plan for two years and required the environmental agency to provide scientific proof that the mute swans were, in fact, harmful.""This has nothing to do with the mute swans. Somebody who has real political influence doesn't like them, in my opinion, because there's no real evidence here that they're an invasive species or why they have to come up and kill them all,"" Mr. Avella added. ""Someone, some political entity that has political connections, is exerting some huge influence to get the agency to kill them.""It was the second time in two years that Mr. Cuomo had vetoed the bill, each time explaining that it duplicated efforts by the environmental agency to revise its swan-management plan in the wake of the public outcry.The plan, which originally called for eradicating virtually all 2,200 of the state's mute swans by shooting, gassing and other measures, was changed this year to emphasize non-deadly control methods. The revised proposal, however declawed, failed to appease animal-rights activists and the bill's sponsors, who continued to insist that the agency had presented no convincing evidence that the swans were harmful.""Impartial observers find it impossible to really assess what the D.E.C. is accusing the mute swans of, because they haven't provided any specific data, just these very broad, speculative accusations that may or may not be true,"" said David Karopkin, the founder of GooseWatch NYC, an animal-rights group. ""I'm not really sure it should be called science, because it doesn't seem scientific to me,"" said Mr. Karopkin, who added that he was not a scientist.After the revised plan was announced, the Department of Environmental Conservation received about 8,000 comments, the vast majority of which were form letters expressing opposition, said Jomo Miller, a spokesman for the agency. It hopes to issue a final version of the plan by the end of this year, he said.Mute swans were first imported to New York from Europe in the 1800s, in order to adorn the estates of wealthy landowners outside New York City. They are now more numerous and, according to wildlife experts, more destructive than their early admirers could have imagined: They pollute waters with their feces, destroy the habitats of native ducks and geese and, according to the environmental agency, pose a threat to airplanes.""In extreme cases, mute swans may attack and kill ducklings, goslings or other small water birds,"" the agency's revised proposal notes, citing two scientific studies and ""many video clips on the Internet.""The new plan aims to limit the swans in Long Island, New York City and the lower Hudson Valley to fewer than 800 birds. Upstate, where swans have settled mainly around Lake Ontario, about 200 birds would be eliminated.The agency promised to use nonlethal methods such as egg-addling, a process in which swan eggs are coated with oil to prevent them from hatching, ""where practical and timely.""Dr. Paul Curtis, a wildlife management expert at Cornell University, said that while mute swans in New York had not yet reached the numbers they had in other states, where swan populations have grown exponentially, the environmental agency was correct in trying to get ahead of the problem.The proposal points out that there are two species of swans that are native to New York, the tundra swan and the trumpeter swan.""Both of these native swan species provide some opportunities for public enjoyment of swans in New York,"" the revised plan noted, looking, perhaps, for silver linings.Unfortunately, the public seems to enjoy the mute swan most of all.""Leave the swans alone. That should be the policy. Enough already,"" said Assemblyman Steven Cymbrowitz, a Democrat from a swan-packed waterfront area of Brooklyn who sponsored the bill in the Assembly, in a statement after Mr. Cuomo's veto.He and Mr. Avella both vowed to reintroduce the bill during the upcoming legislative session, which begins in January, for what would be its third journey through the Legislature.Follow The New York Times's Metro coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the New York Today newsletter.",0.0
Deadly Siege Ends After An Assault on A Mali Hotel:   [Foreign Desk ] [1 ],,"DAKAR, Senegal -- Heavily armed gunmen shouting ""Allahu akbar"" stormed a Radisson Blu Hotel early Friday in Bamako, the capital of the West African nation of Mali, seizing scores of hostages and leaving bodies strewed across the building.The gunmen barreled past the hotel's light security, using fake diplomatic license plates to confuse guards, and then burst into the lobby with their guns blazing.""They started firing everywhere,"" said a receptionist at the hotel who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. ""They were shouting, 'Allahu akbar,' "" meaning God is great. ""They cut someone's throat, a white man.""""I hid in my office,"" he said. ""I saw four of them, armed to the teeth.""By late afternoon, the siege appeared to be over, and no more hostages were being held, said Col. Salif Traoré, Mali's minister of interior security.United Nations officials said that at least 19 people had been killed, as well as two or three attackers, with bodies found lying in the basement and on the hotel floors. They noted that security forces were still sweeping the building in search of bodies and evidence that would shed more light on the assault.An American development worker, Anita Ashok Datar of Takoma Park, Md., was killed, as was at least one Belgian citizen. The nationalities of the other victims were not immediately clear.The gunmen took ""about 100 hostages,"" said Gen. Didier Dacko of the Malian Army, before soldiers sealed the perimeter and stormed inside, ""looking for the terrorists.""From early on, dozens of guests, including women, children and older people, streamed out of the hotel after hiding in their rooms, many of them crying and barely clothed.The attack unfolded with 125 guests and 13 employees inside, according to the operators of the hotel. The visitors had come from far and wide, including Europe, India, China, Turkey and Algeria. They included diplomats, businesspeople, pilots and flight attendants.President Obama condemned the assault from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, calling it ""another awful reminder that the scourge of terrorism threatens many of our nations.""The siege in Mali, a former French colony, occurred only a week after terrorists with assault rifles and suicide vests killed 130 people in attacks across Paris.It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack in Mali. Al Jazeera reported that it had received a recording asserting that a local militant group, Al Mourabitoun, had carried out the assault in conjunction with Al Qaeda's regional affiliate, though the claim could not be independently confirmed.France's defense minister told French television that Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a longtime Qaeda member who claimed responsibility for the 2013 siege of an Algerian gas plant in which dozens of hostages were killed, was ""likely behind"" the attack in Mali, but he acknowledged that ""we are not completely certain of it.""Mr. Belmokhtar has long been a shadowy figure among extremists. Since June, he has been reported killed at least twice, but American officials concede that he is probably still at large.Mali has long struggled with insurrection and Islamist extremism, including smaller-scale attacks on a restaurant and another hotel this year.""We don't want to scare our people, but we have already said that Mali will have to get used to situations like this,"" President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita of Mali, who was visiting Chad, told France 24. He added, ""No one, nowhere, is safe, given the danger of terrorism.""Northern Mali fell under the control of rebels and Islamist militants in 2012. A French-led offensive ousted them in 2013, but remnants of the militant groups have staged a number of attacks on United Nations peacekeepers and Malian forces. Hundreds of French soldiers remain in the country.A peace accord was signed in June between the government and several rebel factions. But the truce has been broken several times, growing lawlessness has driven civilians from the north of the country, and the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali is proving to be one of the deadliest in the world. So far 40 peacekeepers have been killed.United Nations officials said they were worried that the attacks could have been intended, at least in part, to undermine the halting steps toward peace. Some of the people at the hotel were diplomats in town for a meeting to monitor those efforts. In a statement Friday, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's office said he ""deplores any attempt to derail"" the peace process.The Radisson Blu Hotel is a popular place for foreigners to stay in Bamako, a city with about two million people.Twelve to 15 Americans were believed to be at the hotel when the gunmen arrived, an American Defense Department official said. About 20 Indian citizens were there but were evacuated safely, the Indian ambassador to Mali said.Germany's Foreign Ministry said that two Germans were among the hostages who had been released.Six Belgians were registered in the hotel, according to a Foreign Ministry spokesman in that country. At least one of them, a 39-year-old Belgian working for the Wallonia-Brussels regional Parliament, died during the attack. He was in Mali for a conference aimed at training Malian civil servants. Another Belgian remained missing, the ministry said.A diplomat at the Chinese Embassy in Bamako said eight Chinese businesspeople had been trapped in the hotel. Embassy officials at the scene were in touch with some of the Chinese hostages by WeChat, a Chinese messaging service, the diplomat said.Kassim Traoré, a Malian journalist who was in a building about 160 feet from the Radisson, said the attackers had told hostages to recite a declaration of Muslim faith as a way of separating Muslims from non-Muslims. Those who could recite the declaration, the Shahada, were allowed to leave the hotel. The Shabab, a Qaeda affiliate in East Africa, used a similar approach in the attack at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2013.Clément René, 57, a French citizen, came out onto the balcony of his fifth-floor room after he heard repeated gunshots around 7 a.m. One of the attackers, bearing an AK-47, was running into the hotel, shooting back at the hotel security forces.As shooting intensified, Mr. René fled back into his room, turned off the lights, put his phone on silent mode and waited. ""The sound kept coming up as if it was moving from floor to floor,"" he said. ""The sound of guns, explosions and what seemed to be a grenade.""He felt as if he was in the middle of the crossfire. ""I then sent hundreds of text messages, to my family, my wife and two daughters,"" Mr. René said.He was finally freed from his room by Malian soldiers who stormed the corridor of his floor. In the lobby, he passed a body with a tarp thrown over it.""All I could see were his shoes sticking out,"" Mr. René said. ""Big black ranger boots, which made me think it might be one of the terrorists."" The glass lobby doors had been shattered.Kamissoko Lassine, the hotel's chief pastry chef, said two armed men arrived at the hotel around 7 a.m. ""They were driving a vehicle with diplomatic plates,"" he said. ""You know how easy that is at the hotel? The guards just lifted the barrier.""""They opened fire and wounded the guard at the front,"" Mr. Lassine said. ""They took the hotel hostage and moved people into a big hall.""A member of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Mali said there were many French people in the hotel, including Air France staff members. The airline later said in a statement that 12 of its crew members had been at the hotel and were freed.Five Turkish Airlines crew members, including pilots and flight attendants, were also freed, while two remained inside the hotel, a Turkish government official said.Mali has been crippled by instability since January 2012, when rebels and Qaeda-linked militants -- armed with the remnants of the arsenal of the Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi -- began advancing through the country's vast desert in the north and capturing towns.A coup, stirred in part by anger over the government's handling of the insurrection, ousted Mali's elected government in March 2012. Amid the chaos, Islamist rebels consolidated their hold on the northern part of the country, imposing a harsh version of Islamic law.In January 2013, the Islamist forces began advancing south from their northern stronghold, heading in the direction of Mali's capital. France sent in troops to stop them. A brief military campaign halted the Islamist advance, recaptured cities and towns like Timbuktu that had been under the militants' control, and chased the remaining Islamist fighters into the desert.But then, with no warning, other militants linked to Al Qaeda stormed a vast gas production facility in the desert of neighboring Algeria, taking dozens of expatriate workers hostage. Thirty-eight were killed during the siege of the gas plant.With hundreds of French troops still in Mali and the country highly reliant on donors, elections in 2013 restored a democratic government. But its hold on the north remains weak.There are frequent attacks by Islamist fighters, in particular on United Nations troops, in the northern provinces. In August United Nations workers were killed in an assault on a hotel in central Mali. Five months before, militants killed five at a restaurant in Bamako.In the assault in August, jihadists stormed a hotel in Sévaré, north of the capital, where United Nations staff members were staying, seizing hostages and killing at least five Malian soldiers and a United Nations contractor.",0.0

"Political Clout in Mexico, Homes in the U.S.:   [News; Series ]",,"In the fall of 2013, one of Mexico's top housing officials posted an item on Twitter about an advertising campaign promoting mortgages for low-income Mexicans. The campaign's message was simple: ""The most important thing in life is in your house.""It carried the tag line, ""Homes with value.""The official, Alejandro Murat Hinojosa, knows something about homes with value, especially across the border.Over the years, he and members of his immediate family -- starting with his father, José Murat Casab, a former governor of Oaxaca -- have bought at least six properties in the United States, including two condominiums near a ski resort in Utah, another at the beach in South Texas and at least one in Manhattan, according to records and interviews. In New York, José Murat's children have also lived for periods of time in one of the more modest condos at the luxurious Time Warner Center overlooking Central Park.Ownership of the homes was often obscured through variations on family names listed on deeds or through shell companies, according to records examined by The New York Times. In fact, on the day the younger Mr. Murat tweeted about the housing program, public filings in Florida recorded the transfer of a $750,000 Boca Raton condo that had been purchased in his wife's name to an entity called IMRO 2013 Trust.The Murats' real estate holdings stand in contrast to the Everyman image that José Murat, renowned for his political might and booming personality, worked to project as governor.""I arrived to the state government with my wife, Lupita, and my four children,"" he said a year before his term ended in 2004. ""And I'm leaving as I arrived, with the same trousers, with the same shoes, with the same shirts and the same car.""The Murat properties, which emerged during a Times investigation into the people behind shell companies that own condominiums at the Time Warner Center, have not been the subject of any official inquiry and there is no evidence of any wrongdoing behind the purchases. But the private assets of Mexico's public officials have come under intense focus recently with a fresh round of revelations and protests centered on the country's endemic corruption. (Read a summary of this article in Spanish.)Last fall, a scandal erupted over reports that a government contractor had built a multimillion-dollar home for the wife of Mexico's president, Enrique Peña Nieto. While Mr. Peña Nieto's wife, Angélica Rivera, said she was paying for it with money she earned as a soap opera star, she also revealed she owned a condo in Florida. Around the same time, Mr. Peña Nieto disclosed his own $3.3 million in real estate, jewelry, art and other investments. Last week, he said a new federal comptroller would examine purchases by him and his wife of homes in Mexico.And in December, an official at Infonavit, the housing agency run by Alejandro Murat, resigned after a photo of his son with a Porsche was posted on social media, setting off a furor and prompting federal inquiries. The official said the posting was a joke and the car did not belong to his family.These revelations added to the already widespread anger over accusations that corrupt police officers were involved in the abduction and presumed murder last year of 43 college students by a drug cartel. As demonstrations spread, Mr. Peña Nieto was reeling. His Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, had ruled the country for seven decades until 2000, and he had pledged to erase its legacy of corruption when he took office more than two years ago.José Murat, the former Oaxaca governor, has long been a PRI insider. His rise from a childhood in one of Mexico's poorest states to a position as a power broker who has the president's ear is the stuff of lore. There was a failed, and to some skeptics faked, attempt on his life; a long campaign to block a federal audit of state spending; and a record of hardball political tactics. Mr. Murat, who has also served as a federal legislator, recently raised his profile again by leading an effort by the Peña Nieto administration to build a cross-party legislative agenda.Mr. Murat's 39-year-old son, Alejandro, by contrast understated and polished, worked for Mr. Peña Nieto in state government before being appointed to the federal housing post. In some ways, the father and son represent the new and the old of the PRI, said Edward L. Gibson, a Northwestern University professor who studied Oaxaca for a book on authoritarian governments.""Peña Nieto may be the new face of the PRI,"" Mr. Gibson said, ""but the dinosaurs are still part of the coalition.""José and Alejandro Murat denied ownership of several residences around the country that The Times traced to them.José Murat said the Time Warner condo was owned by a relative. Alejandro Murat said the Florida condo was owned by his mother-in-law. Another Manhattan condo, which records show was originally purchased in the name of Alejandro's wife, belongs to an uncle, he said.In an email, José Murat said the only United States properties owned by his immediate family were the two condos in Park City, Utah. They were purchased in 2004 -- one by his two sons and the other by his two daughters -- for a total of $690,000. At least one of the Murat children was a teenager at the time. But Mr. Murat said: ""I do not personally own any real estate directly or indirectly in the United States.""The Murat properties show how the legal mechanisms available in the United States to hold property without disclosing the actual owner's name can make tracing money difficult. This can be a particular problem for Mexico, which, like many developing nations, has long experienced the flight of both legitimate and illicit capital.Wealthy Mexicans are buying property in the United States at a brisk pace with few questions asked, The Times found, even as border security is tightened against poor immigrants trying to cross into the country.""You have all these governors coming and going here, and they have investment properties in the United States with money made in Mexico,"" said Juan Ruiz-Healy, a Mexican journalist who anchored the country's ""60 Minutes"" program and has written about José Murat over the years. ""The U.S. will never say to them, 'Where did the money come from?""'The GovernorThe assassination attempt is like so much of Mr. Murat's 40-year political career, full of drama and suspicions ultimately left unresolved.There are numerous versions of the event, but the initial one went like this: One morning in March 2004, Mr. Murat was outside the Hotel Victoria in Oaxaca when armed men ambushed the 1999 Nissan Quest minivan he was in, leaving six bullet holes.""The matter here is that they tried to assassinate,"" Mr. Murat said in a televised interview days later. ""I have mixed feelings -- anger, rage -- because what they wanted at the end of all this was a dead body.""Even though the governor was slightly injured, there were skeptics who believed he had staged the attack to somehow enhance his image. The federal attorney general issued a news release questioning details of the attack. During the federal investigation, Mr. Murat repeatedly delayed giving a statement and the attorney general asked a judge to order the arrests of seven people who had backed up the governor's account on charges of perjury or altering the crime scene.The whole matter faded away after Mr. Murat demanded that the federal Congress put the attorney general on trial instead.The episode came toward the end of Mr. Murat's term, but by then there was much intrigue around him, built up over decades in politics.Mr. Murat grew up in Ciudad Ixtepec, in poor, mountainous Oaxaca State, where his parents were shopkeepers. He was in law school in Mexico City around the time of the Tlatelolco massacre in 1968, when military and police officers turned their guns on student protesters. While students raged against the PRI, Mr. Murat joined a pro-government group and met other young party loyalists, including Fidel Herrera Beltrán, the future governor of Veracruz, who remains a close friend. Mr. Murat went on to hold numerous PRI jobs, including posts as a party spokesman and as party representative to several states.""He was just a middle-level functionary,"" said Federico Estévez, a political science professor at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México. ""But he had the right connections.""Files from a former Mexican intelligence agency, which kept tabs on many foes and friends of the government, suggest that early on, Mr. Murat caused some amount of controversy.The files, available at the national archives, contain what amount to unverified field reports. One reported on a 1982 visit by the PRI presidential candidate to Oaxaca, which Mr. Murat then represented as a federal legislator. Residents circulated a letter signed by three local politicians, saying Mr. Murat had been putting his friends and relatives in public offices in an effort to ""take over everything"" and impose a ""dictatorship on the people.""Beyond connections, Mr. Murat has a certain bravado and an imposing physical presence. ""It was Lyndon Johnson style,"" Mr. Gibson, the Northwestern University professor, said. ""Stand up, tower over them and just threaten them with his size.""In 1998, Mr. Murat, then about 50, was elected to a six-year term as governor of Oaxaca. Mexico's governors wield considerable power, mostly owing to the large amounts of federal money at their discretion, especially in poorer states like Oaxaca.But there have been few checks on how the public money is spent, and Mr. Murat had a reputation for tightly controlling the distribution of federal funds to local officials as a way to maintain power.Manuela Garza, who worked in the state's planning office, said, ""The distribution of policies and all of that wasn't equal."" As part of her job, Ms. Garza visited villages where people lived without power, water or adequate health care, and she said the perception was that Mr. Murat ""wasn't prioritizing the people, that he was steering money to his regions.""Soon after Mr. Murat became governor, a new federal commission moved to audit Oaxaca's use of federal funds. The Mexican Congress also proposed looking into money that the state had started steering to a handful of companies, according to congressional records.For years, Mr. Murat and some other governors argued that federal audits were an overreach of power. When the audit agency sent officers to Oaxaca, Mr. Murat blocked them. The auditors gained access only after a legal battle that went all the way to the Supreme Court, but by then Mr. Murat had left office. His tenure would never be fully audited.Over the years, Mr. Murat and his family have periodically faced questions about their finances.In a recent email to The Times, Mr. Murat said: ""As is widely known in Mexico, my family and the family of my wife who passed away in 2000 have many assets and sources of income. This patrimony has been built up over generations through hard work and is unrelated to my public service.""Documents and interviews show that over his career Mr. Murat was paid modest salaries in party jobs and that he did some work as a private lawyer. Around the time he first won election as a federal legislator in the 1970s, he reported total earnings of 25,000 pesos, or about $1,100 a month. His salary as governor reached just over $11,500 a year -- plus a bonus whose amount was not disclosed.His brother-in-law, Mateo Jiménez, said that the Murat family was ""more or less middle class"" and that he knew of no large inheritances from Mr. Murat's parents. Early in José's political career, he said, Mr. Murat's mother sold housewares from her home.When Mr. Murat was governor, Proceso, a Mexico City magazine, wrote that he and his deputies experienced ""inexplicable enrichment."" He had a particularly rough relationship with the local newspaper Noticias, which published an article questioning where his mother, Juana Casab, had gotten her money.Ericel Gómez Nucamendi, the paper's publisher, said in an interview that he believed the governor had long held a grudge against him for refusing his request to purchase part of his newspaper. ""He wanted to grab the newspaper,"" said Mr. Gómez, who is now a politician in Oaxaca. ""He offered to buy it and return it to me when he was no longer governor.""Another local businessman, Humberto López Lena, said in an interview that Mr. Murat proposed that he act as a proxy to gain a share of businesses in Oaxaca. Mr. López Lena said that soon after Mr. Murat was elected, the governor said: ""You have a good image and you can be my rep.""Mr. López Lena said Mr. Murat asked him several more times, and he repeatedly turned him down.Recently, Mr. Murat has been drawn into a controversy involving two other former governors, including his friend from the 1970s, Mr. Herrera of Veracruz. It centers on accusations brought in a lawsuit by an activist and lawyer from Chiapas who alleged that the former governor of that state improperly steered state business to construction companies. The lawyer, Horacio Culebro, has said that Mr. Murat and Mr. Herrera have an interest in those companies.In summer 2013, opposition legislators urged prosecutors to look into the allegations, with one saying, ""what we see is a large network of corruption involving ex-governors."" A federal tribunal is deciding whether a state attorney general must review the evidence. Mr. Herrera and Mr. Murat have denied any involvement. Meanwhile, Mr. Culebro said in a deposition that he had received threats via cellphone and Facebook. ""I hold José Murat Casab and Fidel Herrera Beltrán responsible for anything that may happen to me,"" he said.Responding to written questions about his governorship -- including the allegations by Mr. López Lena, Mr. Gómez and Mr. Culebro -- Mr. Murat wrote in an email: ""Most of your questions are based on the libelous and false assumption that I have done something corrupt. As such they do not merit a response.""Purchases in the U.S.Mr. Murat and his family purchased property in the United States throughout his long political career. In 1984, Mr. Murat and his brother, Karim, bought a condominium on Texas's South Padre Island, a resort town popular with Mexicans, according to public property records.The purchase followed a familiar course taken by many Mexicans of means.""The U.S. and maybe Switzerland are the two main places where Mexican wealth has been deposited,"" said Mauricio Cano, a Mexico City lawyer who wrote a book titled ""Game Theory and Tax Evasion"" and advised friends of Mr. Murat on a Manhattan real estate deal.Soon after buying the South Padre Island condo, the Murat brothers purchased a house nearby, in Brownsville. In both instances, they listed only their maternal surname on the deeds -- meaning José Murat's name appears as ""José M. Casab.""The deeds, on file in Cameron County, list their sister's address in Brownsville, where her husband owns a building used for a nightclub. In political filings and other public records, Mr. Murat has alternated between using ""Casab"" and the more common Mexican surname ""Casas.""By the 1990s, The Times found, Mr. Murat's brother, Karim, and his mother, Juana, had begun buying properties in Michigan, where she had relatives. They have four properties there between them -- a modest suburban home, a condo, land and commercial property. A cousin, Alfredo Casab, a lawyer in Michigan, confirmed that Karim and Juana were related to the former governor.Just as Mr. Murat's term as governor was drawing to a close in 2004, his children purchased the condos in Park City, Utah, where the family likes to ski, and put their names on the deeds.Mexicans are among those who have been increasingly using shell companies and trusts to move money abroad, said Geralda Buckley Kral, a wealth adviser based in Zurich. Such mechanisms provide privacy, yet can also enable a person to deny ownership. ""If he gets questioned about these assets, he can legally say he doesn't own it because he doesn't own it in his name,"" she said.Ms. Kral said that she helped set up a trust for a Mexican family named Herrera that was used in 2007 to purchase a condo at 40 West 55th St., a small building just off Fifth Avenue, near the Museum of Modern Art and Central Park. The deed lists the name of a son of Fidel Herrera, Mr. Murat's friend, as a representative of the shell company that bought the condo.After the apartments were upgraded and converted to condos in 2007, the Herreras and four other Mexican families scooped up five units for a total of $6.1 million. ""They were all friends of friends,"" said Louise Phillips Forbes, a broker at Halstead Property who handled the sales.""I have over the years placed many, many wealthy Mexican families, and their philosophy has been that many of them were educated in the States and many of them hold a residence here,"" Ms. Forbes said. ""They're home working, but they come all the time.""Alejandro Murat's wife, Ivette Morán, purchased Unit 6C, according to New York City property records. Next to her apartment, the records show, is a unit purchased by Melissa F. Alcántara, the daughter of José Murat's longtime girlfriend.Upstairs is a unit owned by a shell company, but property records include the name of a son of Fernando Margáin, the former mayor of San Pedro Garza García in northern Mexico. Another owner in the building is Víctor Manuel Álvarez Puga, who ran an accounting firm in Mexico.Despite public records containing their names, sons of both Mr. Herrera and Mr. Margáin told The Times they were simply doing legal work for the actual owners, whom they would not identify. But in both cases, family members registered telephones to the units.For the Murats, the 55th Street condo meant they now had two places to stay in New York. ""The Time Warner came before 40 West 55th Street,"" Ms. Forbes said. ""Alejandro's family owns in Time Warner.""The Time Warner condo used by the Murats is owned by a shell company called Nivea Management, which was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. The condo, purchased for $1.76 million, was one of two sold together on Jan. 12, 2004; the other cost $3.68 million. But figuring out whose money is behind any shell company is difficult.John Zampino, the lawyer who set up both companies, declined to identify the buyers, saying his job called for discretion. ""It's a very delicate situation, and I can be criticized,"" he said. ""I can't even say who I represent.""Both transactions were handled by the Ira Berman real estate law firm. The firm did ""robo-signing for the rich"" and did not check the backgrounds of buyers, according to a former lawyer there, who asked not to be named out of concerns for his reputation. Mr. Berman, who has since served a prison term for day-trading with his clients' escrow money, declined to discuss whether his firm did background checks of its clients and said he did not recall the Time Warner sales.Soozy Katzen, a real estate agent at Fox Residential Group who handles rentals for one of the two condos, said, ""There's no way you're going to reach the owners. They buy under corporate names to not reveal who they are.""But she did say that the owner of the condo on the 57th floor, after originally planning to rent the unit, let his son use it instead.In fact, Alejandro Murat, who was then in graduate school at Columbia, began using that condo, according to records reviewed by The Times. José Murat confirmed that his son lived there in the summer of 2005.As for the ownership of the condo, people with knowledge of the building said they were told it was purchased by a group of Mexicans, including a businessman named Guillermo Vogel Hinojosa.José Murat said in response to questions that the condo was owned by Mr. Vogel. Mr. Vogel, who declined to discuss the properties, is a cousin of Mr. Murat's deceased wife.The Housing ChiefProtesters gathered outside Oaxaca's grand 16th-century church in 2013, as friends and family flowed into a baptism and first communion ceremony for Alejandro Murat's daughters.""Repudiate José Murat"" a sign said, according to news reports at the time. Another called José Murat a ""two-legged rat,"" Mexican slang for thief.The Murats spend much of their time outside Oaxaca, but as Alejandro has risen as a contender to be Oaxaca's next governor, some old tensions over the family are being stirred.It remains an open question in political circles how independent the son is of the father.""Alejandro has his own merits and his father's figure may even be uncomfortable at times,"" said Dulce María Sauri, a former national leader of the PRI.Alejandro Murat practiced law for a few years before working for the State of Mexico, where Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, and then becoming head of Infonavit, which administers loans and mortgages to a large number of Mexican workers.All the while, the family has taken steps that obscure the ownership of several holdings in the United States.Alejandro Murat's wife, Ivette Morán, had purchased the $1.18 million condo on West 55th Street using her maternal surname. The deed reads ""Ivette M. Rodríguez,"" but in one place it lists ""Morán"" under her signature.In 2011, while her husband was working for the State of Mexico, Ms. Morán transferred the property at no cost to a trust called Himo Ltd. That transfer was handled by Mr. Zampino, the lawyer who also set up the shell company that owns the Time Warner condo used by the Murats. (Mr. Zampino told The Times that he never worked for the family.)In a statement provided through the housing agency, Alejandro Murat said the 55th Street condo is owned by his uncle, José Hinojosa. Mr. Hinojosa's name is on the forwarding address for a temporary mortgage placed on the condo, but Ivette Morán Rodríguez is listed as the borrower. She is also listed on the deed as the president of the Himo trust, and she signed the line for the buyer.Alejandro Murat's statement also said the Florida condo is owned by his mother-in-law. But when the condo was transferred into a trust in late 2013, his wife was listed as the trustee. There have been two mortgages on the condo, one signed by Alejandro Murat and his wife, and the other signed by his wife.Late last year, the day after The Times contacted the Murats with an additional interview request, José Murat's four children transferred their Utah condos into shell companies. Both companies -- XILA Company and LOMA AEAI -- were incorporated in Florida in 2013 by Alejandro Murat's wife. The forwarding address for one company was the Florida condominium.José Murat's youngest daughter, Lorena, has been the most recent Murat at the Time Warner Center, living there for two years and studying fashion at Parsons the New School for Design. She now runs a fashion blog called The Fancy Archive. The site's registration lists the Time Warner condo as its base.To contact the reporters, email louise@nytimes.com or alejandraxanic@gmail.com.Design, graphics and production by Tom Giratikanon, Mika Gröndahl, Josh Keller, Yuliya Parshina-Kottas, Graham Roberts, Shreeya Sinha, Rumsey Taylor and Jeremy White.Towers of Secrecy: Fourth of five articles.; Articles in this series are examining the rising use of shell companiesto buy high-end real estate in the United States, and the hiddenowners behind them.

Behaviorists Show the U.S. How to Nudge:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The federal government found a clever way to make a little extra money last summer.Some vendors who provide federal agencies with goods and services as varied as paper clips and translators were given a slightly different version of the form used to report rebates they owe the government.The only difference: The signature box was at the beginning of the form rather than the end. The result: a rash of honesty. Companies using the new form acknowledged they owed an extra $1.59 million in rebates during the three-month experiment, apparently because promising to be truthful at the outset actually caused them to answer more truthfully.The altered form is among the early successes of a year-old effort by the Obama administration to apply academic research on human behavior to the business of running a government. The idea is that a little science might help the government collect taxes, distribute benefit payments and even help people find jobs, get an education or save for retirement.This month, the White House announced the creation of a Social and Behavioral Sciences Team to lead this push, and President Obama issued an executive order encouraging agencies to conduct their own experiments.""The goal is to help people who want to take a given step but may face some barriers,"" said Maya Shankar, the Oxford-educated scientist who leads the team. ""You can do everything to make sure that a program is well designed, but if it's not getting into the hands of people who are supposed to be benefiting from it, everything up to that point was for naught.""Governments generally operate on the assumption that people are rational. One of the basic implications of mainstream economic theory is that public policy works best when people are treated as rational decision makers.Yet a growing body of research has found that people are not only irrational on occasion, but they tend to be irrational in some consistent and predictable ways. People tend to be influenced by the last thing they heard. They tend to fear losses more than they like profits. They tend to be a little lazy.And researchers from this new school argue the government should account for these tendencies.""Almost any domain that they let us go in, we could figure out some way of making at least modest improvements in what they're doing,"" said the University of Chicago economist Richard Thaler, one of the founders of behavioral economics and a leading advocate of governments making use of what he calls ""nudges.""Ms. Shankar and her team of 15 -- including psychologists, economists and sociologists -- conducted about a dozen experiments over the last year to prove the value of the approach, but so far the successes remain small. The rebate forms, for example, increased revenue by about 6 percent.Moreover, nudges are hard to mass-produce. The British government, which created a ""nudge unit"" in 2010, found it could increase collections from delinquent taxpayers by telling them nine in 10 neighbors had paid up, a common marketing technique. But when the United States Treasury Department tried a similar technique last year, it did not work.And changing behavior is tricky. The most important change behavioral economics has made in federal policy is a 2006 law that made it easier for companies to enroll workers in retirement plans by default. The change has increased participation, but it also may have reduced the amounts some people have saved. People enrolled by default also tend to stick with the default savings rate, often lower than the average for people who sign up themselves.""Is the government really competent to determine the directions in which we should be nudged?"" asked John Cochrane, a Stanford University economist.Mr. Cochrane said the administration's experiments so far seem basically harmless -- ""government spam, messaging people to tell them to do x or y or z."" But he said he was troubled by the possibility of more forceful nudges devised by technocrats influenced by lobbyists or other political considerations.""The case for the free market is not that each individual's choices are perfect,"" he wrote in a recent blog post. ""The case for the free market is long and sorry experience that government bureaucracies are pretty awful at making choices for people.""Still, behavioral scientists have won the attention of policy makers partly by holding out the promise of improvements at very little cost. Nudges are cheap. The idea that tweaking a tax-collection letter might bring in as much money as hiring tax collectors is deeply appealing in an era of austerity.""I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being, in happiness, in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money,"" David Cameron, the British prime minister who created the first ""nudge unit,"" said during his 2010 campaign.An early victory: The British team found people who had not registered vehicles were more likely to do so if they were sent a picture of the car beside the standard warning it could be taken away.Civil servants in Britain are being trained in behavioral science, and the governments of Australia, Denmark and South Africa are among those dabbling in nudgery. The British program, spun out of the government, was recently hired by Bloomberg Philanthropies to work with American cities. The World Bank is mulling the lessons for economic development.Ms. Shankar's team asks federal agencies about their priorities, then mines the academic literature for ways to improve those policies. The team also has created a network of academic institutions to provide advice.The adjusted rebate forms, for example, were inspired by a 2012 study. Researchers similarly adjusted the form sent to customers of an auto insurance company asking them to report how many miles they had driven. Those asked to sign at the top reported driving about 2,400 more miles.(The persistence of these effects is an open question. The first time a person signs, they answer the questions more honestly, but by the 10th time, the nudge might be powerless. Ms. Shankar said there had been ""a little dip"" in rebate payments since last summer, but the effect remained quite strong. Mr. Thaler noted that alarm clocks wake people up every morning.)Perhaps even more than new ideas, the behavioral group is bringing a new approach to government. Experimentation is the key: Different nudges are tried systematically, results are quantified and, even after the best approach is selected, the team goes back to see how things are working.The team, for example, created eight versions of an email encouraging members of the military to enroll in a retirement savings program. About 80,000 service members received each version. The most effective, which combined step-by-step instructions with an example of how much a person could save by putting away a little money each month, roughly doubled enrollment rates.These efforts are informed by common sense as much as academic insight. People are more likely to do things that are easier to do. Yet simplicity has rarely been a priority in the development of federal programs. ""They've been more worried about making sure it's legally perfect than making sure it's understandable to anybody,"" Mr. Thaler said. ""So there's a lot of room to simplify things.""Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.",0.0

"Rapping, and Settling Scores:   [The Arts/Cultural Desk ]",,"TORONTO -- This year's OVO Fest truly began about three hours before Drake took the stage at the Molson Canadian Amphitheatre here on Monday night, when a picture of him preparing for the concert while wearing a Free Meek Mill T-shirt slipped onto the Internet.Over the last two weeks, Drake and Meek Mill have been engaged in a war of words, a rarity in hip-hop these days and a referendum on the genre's evolving value systems. Meek Mill accused Drake of using a ghostwriter on a song they recently collaborated on, something Meek Mill and his traditionalist values couldn't abide. He probably saw Drake -- a rapper who also sings and freely emotes and generally isn't much preoccupied with the tenets of the genre as it was in harsher times -- as an easy target no one had yet hit squarely.In February, Drake released ""If You're Reading This It's Too Late,"" which is heavy with the stresses of life at hip-hop's top. It's easily the most anxious, resentful and muscled music Drake has ever made -- the stuff of fighting, not retreating.So Meek Mill shouldn't have been surprised when Drake replied to his provocations with a pair of songs, ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back,"" that tackled him head-on. And he shouldn't have been surprised when Drake opened his performance on Monday, the third and last night of the festival that carries his label's name, with those songs. During ""Back to Back,"" the huge screen behind Drake played an endless scroll of memes insulting Meek Mill, the kind found all over Instagram and Twitter in recent weeks. Online, this would have been called a slide show, or click bait; here, it was a bludgeon.This was the sixth time Drake has hosted OVO Fest here in his hometown, and with this year's performance, he fully turned the annual show into his personal Summer Jam. In years past, the festival carried a heavy dose of local pride and special guests galore; this year, it offered all that and also a place for the host to settle scores.Drake's addressing of Meek Mill played like ""If You're Reading This"" come to life. But later in the night, too, he remained focused almost exclusively on the tougher parts of his catalog -- bionic choruses, punchy rapping, almost no singing to speak of. Notably, he performed only three songs released prior to December 2013. Before then, he was still toggling between hard and soft identities. Those songs were also the only tracks released commercially on one of his studio albums (if you accept that ""If You're Reading This"" is a mixtape -- a commercially released mixtape -- as Drake has said).The Drake of the last 20 or so months has been extremely prolific, releasing songs -- individually or in small batches, some originals, some remixes -- that have revealed new sides to his creative approach. As a result, his career is best understood not in terms of eras but in terms of moments. (The same is true of his merchandise. If you went to the OVO store during the festival, you could buy a T-shirt with an image of a fully charged iPhone battery on the back, a reference to ""Charged Up."")Which explains why, even though a migraine tension permeated ""If You're Reading This,"" every song Drake has released in the last few weeks, even the ones taking aim at Meek Mill, has found him sounding casual, like someone who's learned how to breathe evenly amid tumult.A self-aware oversharer, Drake is the ideal musician for an era of relentless self-documentation. He's not waiting around to deliver grand statements; he'd much rather detail his journey bit by bit, which is why even a show like this, largely restricted to the current phase of his career, can still contain multitudes: pugnacious tracks from ""If You're Reading This""; levelheaded Meek Mill disses; exuberant guest verses on songs by Big Sean and Nicki Minaj; clever remixes of Fetty Wap's ""My Way,"" ILoveMakonnen's ""Tuesday"" and D.R.A.M.'s ""Cha Cha,"" which Drake has remade as ""Hotline Bling,"" a standout reggae-lite song about an old flame gone cold.Twice Drake ceded the stage for long stretches to artists he described as his idols. First came the undeniable Kanye West, who for a half-hour performed some of his most aggrieved material -- ""New Slaves,"" ""Black Skinhead,"" ""Can't Tell Me Nothing"" -- under a phalanx of spotlights. Even as he was clearly losing his voice, he kept shouting. Mr. West is a case study for how hip-hop success can toughen even the most nuanced artists. The puffed-chest persona that Drake is projecting now? Mr. West has been there twice, maybe three times. No rapper is more experienced at navigating the skepticism of others than he is, to the point at which he no longer responds with outbursts and indignation, but instead knowing smiles.Later came Pharrell Williams, the superproducer turned unexpected recent pop star. Unlike Mr. West, a stage natural who's completely free with his body, Mr. Williams was tightly wound. He looked uncomfortable rapping older songs, only loosening up when singing more recent material, like ""Get Lucky,"" his nu-disco collaboration with Daft Punk, and his new single, ""Freedom"" -- which is somewhere between swing jazz and Soho's ""Hot Music."" On ""Freedom,"" Mr. Williams shrieked like Little Richard and was met with a palpable lack of interest. At no point during the night was the crowd quieter.Together, Mr. Williams, Mr. West and Drake constitute a genuine alternative history of hip-hop's development, one that favors nonmacho creative eccentrics and bypasses the typical binaries: gangster vs. conscious, mainstream vs. underground. All three are stars who have found grace in the in-between spaces.Their success has also opened doors for others, whether someone like Future, whose mainstream acceptance was kick-started by a Drake remix four years ago and who made a surprise appearance here early Monday night, or J. Cole, who headlined the festival's previous night with his sometimes awkward, sometimes convincing declarations of modesty.Mr. West and Mr. Williams also encapsulate the two main paths available to an artist like Drake once he peaks. Mr. West remains a provocateur, not eager to jump into fights but with no problem starting them. Mr. Williams, on the other hand, exudes Zen, as if he exists on a plane just high enough to miss the details of what's happening down below but not so high that he can't be seen.Drake, the onetime softy, is not choosing the easy route. At the end of the night, he performed a string of songs from ""If You're Reading This"" (with a quick return to ""Back to Back"" sprinkled in). Included were ""Know Yourself"" and ""10 Bands"": In recent days, reference demos for both songs recorded by Quentin Miller, the ghostwriter Meek Mill named, were leaked online. (If Drake had brought Mr. Miller out onstage at this point, that might have been the ultimate act of power and defiance.)And there were other taunts, too. Drake teased ""3Peat,"" an as-yet-unreleased song dissing Meek Mill. At the end of ""Know Yourself,"" he brought out dozens of his friends to chant the song's chorus, a display of unity and strength (and something of a warning). And when he performed ""Energy,"" he sang some parts of it, including the refrain ""got a lot of enemies,"" as if to demonstrate that softening the delivery didn't soften the content, or the man, one bit.Photograph Drake: The Rapper at Ovo Fest in Toronto, His Hometown, Where He Performed New Songs and Took Shots at His Rival Meek Mill.

Emails Expand on Mosaic of Secretary Clinton's Days:   [National Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- A new batch of emails released on Friday portray Hillary Rodham Clinton when she was secretary of state, dealing with everything from political unrest in Honduras and a freeze on Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories to minor details of her schedule and even a shipment of apples to her office.She discussed the qualities of job candidates: ""It goes w/out saying that someone lacks discretion is not possible,"" she wrote in 2009 during a search for a speechwriter -- while her closest aides lavished praise on her (""Secretary of Awesome"" was the subject line of one email from her chief of staff, Cheryl D. Mills) and kept her up-to-date on her image in the media. Other emails she received sought privileged access and favors, and in one, the wife of the former prime minister of Britain, Tony Blair, passed on a résumé for a young man applying for a job.In all, this second cache of emails that Mrs. Clinton sent and received during 2009 and parts of 2010, released by the State Department by court order, added 1,356 new tiles to the mosaic of her tenure in President Obama's cabinet. And the monthly release of the emails prescribed by the court ensures that her handling of her electronic correspondence will be updated throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.Last week the inspectors general of the State Department and the nation's intelligence agencies disclosed that they had discovered classified information on the private email account that Mrs. Clinton used, stating that such material should not have been stored outside secure government computer systems -- in this case, on a server she kept at her house.Mrs. Clinton has maintained that none of the information on her server had been classified, though the State Department classified dozens of documents after the emails were released, first on June 30 and again on Friday. In one email released on Friday, Huma Abedin, a close adviser, forwarded a note written by an aide to the former British foreign minister, David Miliband, that ""he doesn't want to send through the system.""Five pages that follow have been redacted entirely, and marked classified until 20 years after Nov. 21, 2009, when the note was forwarded to Mrs. Clinton. The aide, Matthew Gould, said that Mr. Miliband had just returned from Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and ""very much wants the secretary (only) to see this note"" and to ""talk it over with her"" as soon as possible.It was not clear that it was among the emails cited by the inspectors general.A note on the email said it had been classified only on Thursday. It and other emails that were released show that Mrs. Clinton and her aides exchanged notes and memos on all sorts of diplomatic matters, from negotiations with the Russians at a time the Obama administration was seeking to improve relations with the Kremlin to the discussions over the Israeli settlement freeze in 2009.""Abu Mazen wants to see it,"" Mrs. Clinton said, referring to the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, in response to an email from another close aide, Jacob J. Sullivan.Like the disclosure of tens of thousands of emails by WikiLeaks in 2010, the release of these emails has provided granular details of diplomacy that would normally would not become public for years, if ever.""Many thx for your kind note,"" the former American ambassador to Baghdad, Christopher R. Hill, responded when Mrs. Clinton praised the work he was doing. ""I wish I felt better about iraqis as a result, but I truly remain worried about these people. They are truly a collective pain in the neck.""Many of the notes involved mundane logistical matters, such as ensuring that her office had the New York State apples Mrs. Clinton liked.Others offered telling insights into the issues and personalities she encountered on the job.Dozens of the emails involved appointments to various positions in the State Department, with people lobbying for themselves and others -- or sometimes against them. Ivo Daalder, a former ambassador to NATO, sent one email detailing ""three major reasons"" why one candidate was ""not the right person for the job."" The name, like all of the potential appointees, is redacted, as was the position in question.The emails underscored the privileged status of having Mrs. Clinton's direct address. Strobe Talbott, the former deputy secretary of state who now heads the Brookings Institution, wrote to her directly, expressing concerns that ""time-sensitive messages"" were not getting through Ms. Mills's State Department email.Mr. Blair's wife, Cherie, used the personal address at least a dozen times in 2009, pressing Mrs. Clinton to meet with ""my friend,"" Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al-Missned, a Qatari royal, and praising Mrs. Clinton's work.With the subject line ""No longer homicidal,"" Mrs. Clinton wrote to Ms. Mills about Mark Penn, who was her pollster and chief strategist when she was a presidential candidate in 2008, who had earlier conducted polling for a former prime minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra.""Could you try to contact Mark Penn to confirm he no longer represents Thaksin before I call Thai PM at 9:30?"" Mrs. Clinton wrote.Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.",0.0
A Play Space for Rhythm Set on the High Seas:   [Review ],,"In ""Cambuyón,"" a percussive dance and music show that opened at the New Victory Theater on Friday, rhythm comes from many sources: wooden crates, metal buckets, matchsticks, glass bottles, kitchen utensils, feet slapping the floor and hands slapping the body. The concept bears more than a little resemblance to ""Stomp,"" but in this production by Enlace Servicios Culturales, a company based in the Canary Islands and in Barcelona, all of the tapping and clanging happens aboard a ship whose location in time and space remains open to interpretation.What century are we in? What hemisphere? Does it matter? Created with young audiences in mind -- a solid under-12 contingent turned out for opening night -- ""Cambuyón"" sets out to explore the cultural cross-pollination engendered by sea travel. This proves less a historical concern than an excuse to smash together lots of different styles -- clogging, tap, hip-hop, salsa -- in one rambunctious, fast-paced, frayed-around-the-edges hour.Rudimentary projections by Jonatan Rodríguez, who is also one of the seven performers, situate us, at the outset, somewhere along the coast of England. (The show's title comes from the phrase ""Come Buy On,"" which, according to the program, British ships would display when selling goods at Spanish ports.) The first of 12 awkwardly linked scenes features a foot-music battle between two scruffy men: Thanos Daskalopoulos, who wears wooden slabs on the soles of his shoes, and Jep Meléndez, one of the company's artistic directors, in tap shoes. As Raúl Cabrera, the cast's most skilled vocalist, sings a hornpipe, Mr. Meléndez insists on breaking out of their upright routine with looser improvisations. Mr. Daskalopoulos, getting exasperated, eventually sheds his clunky footwear to keep up. Thus we zoom through the evolution of tap in a single costume change.Another contest goes down in the next scene between the sisters Clara and Berta Pons, who introduce popping, locking and other stop-motion snaking moves into the mix. These will resurface in the finale, when the deck of the ship is most like a playground.For all its roughness, ""Cambuyón"" is elegant in its commitment to simple means of generating complex rhythms. Mr. Cabrera supplies an entire jazz band with his vocal cords (he does a good trombone); Mr. Meléndez, in an intricate solo, juggles a polyrhythmic orchestra within his limbs. The show tries hard, sometimes too hard, to entertain, but that didn't seem to matter to all the laughing, cheering kids in the audience.""Cambuyón"" continues through Feb. 22 at the New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan; 646-223-3010, newvictory.org.Photograph CambuyóN: In Foreground, Thanos Daskalopoulos, Left, and Jep MeléNdez Find Rhythm From Many Sources at the New Victory Theater.

"On Probation, Lives Can Run Far Off Track:   [National Desk ]",,"BALTIMORE -- On Christmas Day in 2013, Donyelle Hall and her husband, Roland Jr., gave a party for friends and family at their apartment. Mrs. Hall, a nurse's aide for the severely disabled, had recently taken a college course in medical terminology to improve her earning potential. Mr. Hall worked as a kitchen manager. The two had married the year before.Mrs. Hall had gifts ready for each guest -- pajamas for her mother, new boots for her two grown sons. Well before midnight, the party wound down, and Mrs. Hall, who had been drinking wine, got in the car with her husband to drive two guests home. She was 40 at the time, had zero points for bad driving on her license, and had never been in trouble with the law. That was about to change.She was stopped for speeding, failed a breathalyzer test, and was charged with drunken driving. She pleaded guilty in exchange for entering a probation program under which, provided she followed the rules, she would avoid a conviction.But over the next 18 months, Mrs. Hall would find herself in trouble again and again, though she committed no new crimes. She spent countless hours attending court and lost thousands of dollars in fees, legal costs and wages, as well as two jobs. The judge handling her case imposed conditions far harsher than the norm, then repeatedly called Mrs. Hall into court for violations like failing to ask permission before moving to a different unit in her apartment complex.Ultimately Mrs. Hall spent more than a month in jail because she could not afford another $2,500 to bail herself out.Mrs. Hall's misdemeanor, one of more than a million drunken-driving arrests each year, is not one that would normally attract attention. No one was injured and no property was damaged, and most courts do not come down hard on first-time offenders in drunken-driving cases. Yet as more states turn to probation and parole as a means of reducing incarceration, her story shows how even a supposedly light punishment like probation can severely disrupt a working-class life and weigh heavily on its prospects.While Mrs. Hall's case is extreme, she is far from alone in struggling under the burden of an unusually strict or inappropriate probation, experts say. ""There are a number of people around the country being put on probation that don't really need to be on probation,"" said Carl Wicklund, the executive director of the American Parole and Probation Association, a professional group. ""It's a bad use of resources, and it's bad for the individual."" Nationally, only about two-thirds of probationers successfully complete their terms, according to federal data.At its worst, the criminal justice system can backfire on a stable, nonviolent defendant like Mrs. Hall, said Edward Latessa, director of the School of Criminal Justice at the University of Cincinnati. ""If I took you and locked you up for 30 days, what would happen?"" he said. ""You'd lose your job, you might lose your apartment, you end up with a criminal record. I don't help you -- I give you new risk factors.""It was, Mrs. Hall now says, a learning experience. When pressed about what, exactly, she had learned, she replied: ""I've learned that the system is no good.""A Christmas EncounterMrs. Hall's odyssey began that Christmas evening, when a police officer pulled her over for going 38 miles an hour in a 25-m.p.h. zone. The officer said that Mrs. Hall was slurring her words and that her breath smelled of alcohol. She first denied drinking, the police report said, then admitted to having had some wine. When given a field sobriety test that checks for an involuntary jerking of the eyes, the officer wrote, Mrs. Hall refused to open hers. (The test was voluntary -- drivers have the right to decline.) On a form used to assess Mrs. Hall's demeanor, the police checked off ""talkative,"" ""cocky,"" ""antagonistic"" and ""confused.""The Halls have a different version of events. Mr. Hall said that his wife was not speeding, and that the officer refused to show him the display on the speed detector. When he questioned the stop, he said, the officer threatened to arrest him, too. Mrs. Hall said she did not refuse to open her eyes, but bright lights caused her to squint.The officers arrested Mrs. Hall and took her to jail, where she agreed to take a breathalyzer test. Again, she ran into trouble. She failed three times to blow hard enough into the machine. Breathalyzers can be more difficult, and less accurate, for people as short as Mrs. Hall, who is five feet tall, because they have less lung capacity than average. Finally, on her fourth attempt, she completed the test, which showed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.09. In Maryland, 0.07 is considered ""impaired.""For a woman of Mrs. Hall's weight, assuming drinks were consumed over a four-hour period, the difference between 0.06, considered ""neutral,"" and 0.09 would have been about one glass of wine, according to Leonard R. Stamm, a Maryland defense lawyer who specializes in drunken-driving cases.A Mound of Costs and FeesIn Maryland, many first-time drunken-driving defendants are released on their own recognizance, particularly if no one was hurt. But Mrs. Hall's bail was set by a court commissioner at $25,000.A bail bondsman charged Mr. Hall $2,000, payable in monthly installments, to post bond, and Mrs. Hall was released in less than 24 hours. Everyone assured her the case was minor.Drunken-driving penalties vary widely depending on the judge, but Mr. Stamm said a typical sentence for a first offense might be a year of unsupervised probation. Most judges will offer what in Maryland is called ""probation before judgment,"" or P.B.J., in which a defendant's guilty plea is set aside. If the defendant violates probation, the judge may reimpose the conviction and sentence the person under the original offense -- in Mrs. Hall's case, up to 60 days in jail. If the defendant is successful, she avoids a criminal conviction.As expected, the prosecutor offered Mrs. Hall probation before judgment in exchange for a guilty plea. But Judge Joan Bossmann Gordon of Maryland District Court in Baltimore balked over what she viewed as Mrs. Hall's lack of cooperation with the police. After taking a recess to consider the matter, she agreed to the plea deal ""against my better judgment.""Typically, drunken-driving defendants get a professional assessment to determine what kind of treatment they need: a 26-hour class for ""problem drinkers"" or a 12-hour class for ""social drinkers."" Mrs. Hall denies having a drinking problem, and there is nothing in her record to suggest otherwise.But Judge Gordon did not wait for an assessment. She sentenced Mrs. Hall to 18 months supervised probation, costing her $105 a month in fees for probation and drunken-driving monitoring. She also ordered Mrs. Hall to attend 26 weeks of alcohol education at $70 a week and three Alcoholics Anonymous meetings a week.All told, Mrs. Hall was looking at fees of $385 a month, her lawyer's fee of $1,500, fines and court costs totaling $252.50 and the $2,000 bail bond.Still, her financial situation was about to get worse -- in April, the Motor Vehicle Administration suspended Mrs. Hall's driver's license for 14 days. The suspension contributed, Mrs. Hall said, to the loss of her job at a rehabilitation center 20 miles away.A Judge's ConditionsFor several months, Mrs. Hall complied with the numerous conditions of her probation. She found a new, lower-paying job, met with her probation officer, completed her alcohol counseling, and attended the A.A. meetings, which proved eye-opening.""At first it was very inspiring thinking, oh my goodness, you know, they didn't believe in God and now they do,"" Mrs. Hall said. ""They lost their homes and their kids. They lost so much, and I learned so much.""But then it got depressing because you had people in there stating that, you know, one guy was like, he was molested by his dad, and he don't trust any men now, he do drugs, and he drink, and I mean, he can't go home -- it was just so much.""And then when they'd get around to me, I'm like, 'I'm just happy to be here, thank you for letting me share.' ""Judge Gordon had imposed one particularly unusual condition on Mrs. Hall: She could not move without the judge's permission.So when Mrs. Hall's apartment developed a mouse infestation and she made arrangements to change units, she wrote to the judge on Aug. 19. ""I, Donyelle Hall, will be moving on the first of the month, Sept. 1,"" she wrote. She provided the new address, saying it was ""just around the corner from where I am now.""A few days later, the judge made two notes on the letter, both signed and dated: ""This is not a request for permission prior to moving."" And then: ""Defendant DOES NOT have permission to change her address."" On Sept. 19, a police officer knocked on Mrs. Hall's door and handed her a summons to a probation violation hearing.As it turned out, Mrs. Hall had not moved after all, because the new unit was not available. The summons had been served to her at her original address.But it would take her three and a half months, five court hearings, three letters from her landlord and a copy of her lease to convince the judge. Finally, Judge Gordon dismissed the violation, saying, ""At this point, ma'am, you have a clear understanding of what you can and cannot do on probation without getting permission.""Because probation is like a contract in which the defendant agrees to meet certain conditions in order to avoid incarceration, judges may impose ""lawful, rational and non-arbitrary"" conditions that intrude on the probationer's freedom, such as requiring drug treatment.But too many conditions set up probationers for failure, said Mr. Wicklund of the probation association.""One of the biggest challenges that probation has is having to deal with conditions of supervision that aren't relevant, they're not supported by research and they're not realistic,"" he said.Though Judge Gordon, a former prosecutor who was appointed in 2005, was hit by a drunken driver in the 1980s, according to the state Department of Public Safety website, she was not singling out Mrs. Hall. In April, Tanika Holmes, who had shattered a convenience store window, was forced to move when her brother, with whom she had been living, was evicted, according to court testimony. Ms. Holmes was jailed without bail for two weeks, lost her job, then went to live with an aunt. When the aunt, too, faced eviction, Ms. Holmes, 20, asked her public defender to request permission for her to move.""No, no, no, no,"" Judge Gordon said. ""You've had a really bad attitude through all of this, and I'm not going to authorize another change of address, so don't even think about it.""Judge Gordon declined, through a court spokeswoman, to be interviewed for this story. But in court, she offered Ms. Holmes a glimpse of her reasoning: ""The whole idea is to see if you can do things like follow rules, because if you can follow rules, then that gives the court some hope that you can do things like obey laws.""34 Days in a Bad JailAs Mrs. Hall's residency issue ground through the court, her compliance began to fray. In December, she was unable to provide the attendance slips that could prove she had been to her A.A. meetings.Mrs. Hall said she had lost track of the slips during November, when her scheduled probation meeting had been canceled. ""I'm very, very, very terrible at holding onto papers,"" she said. ""I put papers in my car, in certain pocketbooks, I have them in the glove compartment, on my dresser.""After giving Mrs. Hall two more chances, the probation officer reported the missing paperwork to Judge Gordon in February. This time, the judge issued a warrant for Mrs. Hall's arrest, setting bond in advance at $5,000 cash -- meaning no bondsman could be used. When the probation officer told Mrs. Hall about the warrant, she spent a few days hiding at her mother's house. She had only six months of probation left.Finally, she decided to turn herself in. On March 12, she went to jail, hoping the matter would be resolved quickly.The Baltimore City Detention Center is so bad that the governor recently ordered part of it shut down after a recent federal investigation of the jail resulted in 40 convictions. In June, a court filing by the American Civil Liberties Union detailed black mold, vermin infestations, filthy mattresses and prisoners who, lacking working toilets, were forced to defecate in plastic bags.The jail does not provide clean underwear, so prisoners wash their own in mop buckets and sinks. The shower was so filthy that Mrs. Hall often went unwashed. A fellow inmate was on her third drunken-driving offense, this time after fleeing an accident, but was serving only six months. ""She was getting ready to go home, and she had a hit and run!"" Mrs. Hall said. ""I was so upset I called my husband crying.""Finally, Mrs. Hall's hearing date came on April 1. Mr. Hall was there, with every A.A. attendance slip he could find. Mrs. Hall's probation agent was there, prepared to recommend, according to Mrs. Hall's public defender, Nila Bala, that Mrs. Hall be released. (A request for an interview with the agent was declined.) In a letter, her alcohol treatment counselor had written that Mrs. Hall had completed the course with ""excellent attendance"" and that she had frequently spoken of her A.A. meetings.But the hearing could not take place that day. The jail had failed to transport Mrs. Hall to court.Even so, Mr. Hall held out hope that the judge would relent. ""If you let her out,"" he thought, ""she might could get her job back."" Ms. Bala begged Judge Gordon to at least revisit the $5,000 cash bond, pointing out that her client had not missed a single court date and had turned herself in.""I have to treat her as a potential risk to public safety, given the underlying charge and the failure to attend A.A. meetings,"" Judge Gordon replied. She reduced the bond to $2,500 cash -- still too much for the Halls.""Tears just bust out from my eyes,"" Mr. Hall said. By this time he, too, had lost his job, for unrelated reasons, and was struggling to earn money catering and selling takeout dinners. The Halls were falling behind on rent, car payments, insurance and other bills, and had given up on the payments for a recently purchased vacation time share.""What is she being held for?"" Mr. Hall asked. ""Paperwork?""Finally, on April 14, Mrs. Hall appeared before the judge. By then, she had been locked up for 34 days.At first she wanted to argue that she had attended A.A. But public defenders say they have learned that, in Judge Gordon's courtroom, apology is the better strategy. ""She missed the violation and takes responsibility for that. That's on her,"" Ethan Frenchman, representing Mrs. Hall that day, told the judge.The judge reminded Mrs. Hall of her ""willful refusal to cooperate"" with the police, and then reiterated her belief that Mrs. Hall was an alcoholic. ""Ma'am, what are you going to do on your own to try to keep control of this drinking problem?""Mrs. Hall answered meekly. ""I want to continue my A.A. meetings. It was very helpful.""Judge Gordon ruled that Mrs. Hall could be released, but the conviction would be reimposed, saying, ""I think you've realized by now, ma'am that you're going to have a lifelong struggle with this.""And Still No EndMrs. Hall was ready to put the whole ordeal behind her and move on. But the fallout from that traffic stop 18 months ago refused to end. She received a letter from Maryland's Central Collections Unit, informing her that she still owed $1,806.97 to the state Division of Parole and Probation -- a bureaucratic error, her public defender said, that would take time to unravel.Far worse was another matter of which Mrs. Hall was unaware. The drunken-driving conviction had prompted an automatic six-month license suspension, rendering her unable to drive to work. The notification letters had never reached her, according to state records.Informed of the suspension by a reporter's phone call, Mrs. Hall went silent.

"With Debate and Convention, G.O.P. Looks to Reclaim Ohio Edge in 2016:   [National Desk ]",,"CLEVELAND -- When 17 presidential contenders converge on Cleveland to debate on Thursday, not a few party leaders will be shuddering at the prospect of a scene out of ""The Hunger Games."" Or perhaps a duel of insults dominated by Donald J. Trump.But Republican leaders are delighted by one aspect of the debate: the attention it will shower on Ohio, a state they hope to bring back into the Republican fold in the 2016 election. The ultimate bellwether state in presidential politics, Ohio is the site of next Thursday's debate because, just under a year from now, it will host the 2016 convention in the same Cleveland sports arena.""We will have thousands of Ohio Republican volunteers and activists converging on Cleveland next summer,"" said Mark R. Weaver, a Republican strategist in the state. ""They will be re-energized, signed up and ready to rock.""Besides firing up activists, Republicans are using the debate and the convention to woo Ohio's general-election voters -- who have unerringly picked every president since 1964 -- and highlight before millions of voters nationwide the state's economic resurgence, which the party credits to Republican leadership.""No Republican has ever gained the White House without carrying Ohio,"" said Matt Borges, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. ""You've got to be from Mars to not understand that.""Conservatives plan a ""Buckeye Boot Camp"" on the day of the debate here, training activists at the House of Blues. And around Ohio, more than a dozen paid organizers for the national party, who have moved to the state 15 months before the general election, plan debate-watching parties to help recruit volunteers.The top 10 candidates in national polls, who will debate next Thursday in prime time on Fox News, may include Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a late entry to the race who is enjoying the benefits of being a fresh face. The other candidates will square off in an undercard event in the afternoon.State and national party committees are already deep into planning for 2016 in Ohio. They are determined not to be overrun by the Democrats, who did a superior job of turning out voters in 2012, especially African-Americans in the state's big cities, and convincing a majority of Ohioans that their policies would be better for the economy.Democrats in Ohio conceded the boldness of Republicans planting their flag in Cleveland, a Democratic stronghold. But they denied it would win them new friends. ""They may show up in Ohio, but they still can't escape their message,"" said David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. ""That city will not be impressed by the views expressed in that debate.""Despite the intense television exposure of a national convention, the hoopla-driven events have proved to be poor predictors of a party's success in a state. Both Democrats and Republicans lost the battleground states where they picked their nominees three years ago.Still, many Republicans believe they can break the trend in Ohio. ""The fact we're in the field now preparing for November 2016, the fact we have the convention there -- our increased emphasis on Ohio will, I think, help us carry the state,"" said Ryan Mahoney, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee.The committee plans to ramp up from a dozen or so field organizers in Ohio to more than 200 by next year, a fivefold increase over 2012. That big footprint is inspired in part by President Obama's ground-up national campaigns. Rather than being based haphazardly around the state, the Republican organizers will be assigned to ""turfs,"" geographic areas where data crunchers have identified 8,000 to 12,000 ""persuadable"" voters.One goal: to persuade more Republicans to cast early ballots, a turnout-boosting strategy that Democrats have dominated.Mr. Obama's re-election campaign in Ohio stunned Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, by turning out more African-American voters than in 2008, despite a drop-off in enthusiasm for the president detected by Mr. Romney's pollsters.Mr. Obama's margin of victory in the state, just 103,000 votes out of more than 5 million, was driven in part by the 70,000 additional ballots cast by African-Americans compared with 2008, according to census data.A question for 2016 is whether blacks will turn out in such numbers without an African-American at the top of the ticket. ""Barack Obama was a unique figure in history and we know that,"" Mr. Pepper said. ""The good news is, we know who those voters are, and we'll engage all of our voters early and often.""Another potentially historic nominee, Hillary Rodham Clinton, could put together a somewhat different coalition in Ohio, drawing more women and middle-class voters. Recalling that she defeated Mr. Obama in the Ohio Democratic primary in 2008, her first presidential campaign, Mr. Pepper said, ""She drew votes out of red counties you wouldn't see Democrats drawing.""Ohio Republicans are also looking to their strong dominance of state politics to shape 2016. Besides Mr. Kasich, Republicans hold every statewide office, supermajorities in the Legislature and most congressional seats. The drubbing that Republicans handed Democrats in Ohio in the 2014 midterms, led by Mr. Kasich re-elected with 64 percent of the vote, depleted the Democratic bench of elected officials for future races. It also demoralized the grass roots.""We're in the tall cotton right now,"" said Mr. Borges, the state G.O.P. chairman. ""I don't see how things could be going any worse for Democrats, and we must take advantage of this opportunity.""His Democratic counterpart, Mr. Pepper, said the party is rebuilding in races this year for mayor and school board in Toledo, Akron and other cities. ""We think the message of the other side now is way off kilter from what Ohioans want,"" he said.By some accounts, a home-state convention is a double-edged sword, which may explain why Republicans have not won the state where they chose their nominee since 1992.""I think it fires up some Republican activists in the state,"" said Jo Ann Davidson, the national Republican committeewoman from Ohio. ""It might fire up the Democrats in the other direction.""Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.",0.0

"After Violence, U.S. Puts Sanctions on Burundi Officials and Their Rivals:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"NAIROBI, Kenya -- The United States imposed sanctions Monday against four men connected to a wave of violence in Burundi that has destabilized the central African nation and raised fears of all-out civil war.Hundreds of people have been killed in protests, mysterious attacks and a coup attempt in Burundi since its president, Pierre Nkurunziza, announced in April that he would run for a third term, despite many Burundians' saying it was illegal. He won that third term in July in an election that many Western officials said was flawed.""President Nkurunziza's pursuit of a third term in office has precipitated a humanitarian, economic, and security crisis,"" said a statement by Ned Price, spokesman of the National Security Council in Washington. ""Burundi is on the precipice, but there is a clear path available to Burundi's leaders to avoid further violence and reach a political solution.""The sanctions, which come after the European Union also imposed sanctions on some Burundian officials, are part of an executive order issued Monday singling out any individuals who ""threaten peace and security in Burundi, undermine democratic processes, or who are responsible for or complicit in human rights abuses.""Human rights groups have said that both government forces and rebel groups in Burundi have killed civilians. Bodies are often found on the streets of Bujumbura, the capital. Many victims show signs of torture. Others seem to be random killings.The United States government has been quite critical of Mr. Nkurunziza, but in an apparent effort to achieve some neutrality, the four people identified for immediate sanctions include two from the government and two from the opposition. They are: Alain Guillaume Bunyoni, minister of public security; Godefroid Bizimana, deputy director-general of the national police; Godefroid Niyombare, the leader of a coup attempt in May; and Cyrille Ndayirukiye, the deputy leader of the coup attempt. Their assets have been frozen and visas restricted.The United States and other Western governments have tried to push Mr. Nkurunziza into an inclusive dialogue with Burundi's political opposition. The White House said Monday in a statement that it calls on all parties to ""to live up to their commitments to participate in an internationally mediated dialogue outside of Burundi.""Analysts said that the influence of human rights groups on the Obama administration was a big reason the United States moved forward on the sanctions, and leading human rights observers seemed to be pleased.""The U.S. sanctions send a strong message that impunity for serious crimes is not acceptable,"" said Carina Tertsakian, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""We hope these sanctions will deter senior Burundian officials from ordering, carrying out or tolerating serious abuses in the future.""",0.0
"From Cheap Seats, ESPN Misses the Action:   [Sports Desk ]",,"When ESPN brought its announcing crew to Citi Field on Sunday for the Mets-Nationals game, I was leery of what would be accomplished by planting all three announcers in the bleachers, far from the traditional broadcast booth. It was not a very illuminating spot from which to call a game that would, with the Mets' victory, put them in a tie for first place with the Nationals.This had been destined to be an SNY game until ESPN exercised its right on July 17 to give a national prime-time slot to a game that was going to be shown locally.ESPN can select games on two weeks' notice for Sunday nights in August and September, which can irk fans who rely on the original afternoon start times. When they purchased their tickets, they expected to be home by dinnertime, not in time for a late-night snack. Is it fair? No. But it is the business we've all chosen as modern-day fans; powerful networks make choices that inconvenience us. Dissatisfaction with the move could have been principally responsible for the paid attendance of 35,374, well below the 42,996 for Saturday night.ESPN could have moved three other afternoon games (in Los Angeles, Baltimore and Cincinnati) but selected Nationals-Mets. It was, an ESPN spokesman said, ""the best game on the board out of the four possibilities."" So, Mets fans, shifting the game was really praise for your team's resurgence. Blame the prime-time start on Sandy Alderson -- he's finally fielded a winning team!Beyond inconvenience to fans at Citi Field was the shift's impact on viewers. When your games are called by a terrific group of announcers -- Gary Cohen, Ron Darling and Keith Hernandez of SNY -- who are worth watching whether the team is good or awful, do you want anyone else to sit in for them from the Big Network?Are Dan Shulman, Curt Schilling and Aaron Boone (who was substituting for John Kruk) better, more informed voices? Not at all -- and certainly not when handicapped by calling the game from the distant stands. They were so far from the action that they clearly had to rely heavily on their monitors. And they did nothing to make their unusual placement worth the effort. They called the game as they would from the booth, but they could not see the field as they normally would have.After the Nationals' Anthony Rendon slammed a first-inning pitch from Mets starter Noah Syndergaard off the left-center-field wall -- not far from ESPN's version of Uecker seats -- it was called a double until Washington Manager Matt Williams asked for a challenge that he eventually won. It was only then, from such a poor announcing position, that the ESPN crew recognized that it might have been a home run. But Schilling was more interested in teasing Shulman for not reaching for the ball, and Shulman asked: ""Was this over the line? I was too busy ducking for cover to see.""During the eighth inning, the trio in the stands and the reporter Buster Olney discussed, ad nauseam, Syndergaard's improving ability to get first-pitch strikes. Their discussion continued as Rendon shot a ground-rule double down the right-field line. It continued without anyone's saying anything about Rendon's hit. Was it a ground-rule double? No one said. The live shot was not telling (and disappeared quickly), and no replay was shown. The discussion continued as ESPN cut to its announcers and then to Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy conferring on the mound with Syndergaard.Shulman finally acknowledged the vision of a base runner at second when he saw a two-shot of Syndergaard in the foreground and Rendon in the background.More than three minutes had passed from Rendon's hit to the end of the half-inning, and nothing had been said of how he ended up there.This is not a screed against experimenting with the traditional model of two or three announcers in a booth above home plate. But if you want to detour from tried-and-true game-calling, then offer something different or radical, not just three guys trying to call a game as they would in a booth, but from lousy seats. The next time ESPN ventures into the grandstand, it should put one analyst there to interact with fans but not require him to do what he would do in a booth. Let him have fun; let him capitalize on the unusual surroundings.Or let Schilling sit with a scout behind home plate and let them talk about pitching. Just don't move everyone in the booth to the Land of Far, Far Away and expect a fully informed broadcast.Giddy Mets fans will watch their renascent team play wherever the announcers are. After 348,877 viewers in the New York market watched Friday night's victory and 322,945 tuned in Saturday night for the 3-2 win -- combining to be SNY's highest-rated Mets series in three years -- an even larger local audience of 474,00 households saw the ESPN telecast.So far this season, the Mets' average viewership on SNY is up 29 percent, to 206,607.And now, let us return to Gary, Keith and Ron, in a booth, it is hoped.AuthorAffiliation RICHARD SANDOMIR sandor@nytimes.comPhotograph Michael Conforto Hitting a Three-Run Home Run Monday for the Mets, Who Were Coming Off a Rousing Sweep of the Nationals.

The Village Girl Who Grew Up to Be a Billionaire:   [Money and Business/Financial Desk ],,"Zhou Qunfei is the world's richest self-made woman. Ms. Zhou, the founder of Lens Technology, owns a $27 million estate in Hong Kong. She jets off to Silicon Valley and Seoul, South Korea, to court executives at Apple and Samsung, her two biggest customers. She has played host to President Xi Jinping of China, when he visited her company's headquarters.But she seems most at home pacing the floor of her state-of-the-art factory, tinkering.She'll dip her hands into a tray of water, to determine whether the temperature is just right. She can explain the intricacies of heating glass in a potassium ion bath. When she passes a grinding machine, she is apt to ask technicians to step aside so she can take their place for a while.Ms. Zhou knows the drill. For years, she labored in a factory, the best job she could get having grown up in an impoverished village in central China.""She'll sometimes sit down and work as an operator to see if there's anything wrong with the process,"" said James Zhao, a general manager at Lens Technology. ""That will put me in a very awkward position. If there's a problem, she'd say, 'Why didn't you see that?' ""Ms. Zhou has honed her hands-on knowledge into a world-class, multibillion-dollar operation, one at the vanguard of China's push into high-end manufacturing. Lens Technology is now one of the leading suppliers of the so-called cover glass used in laptops, tablets and mobile devices, including the Apple iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy. This year, her factories are expected to churn out more than a billion glass screens, each refined to a fraction of a millimeter.""This is an industry that requires highly sophisticated technology,"" says Stone Wu, an analyst at IHS Technology, the research firm. ""If you have a ruler, check out how thin 0.5 millimeters is, and you'll understand how hard it is to manufacture something that thin.""In creating a global supplier, Ms. Zhou, 44, has come to define a new class of female entrepreneurs in China who have built their wealth from nearly nothing -- a rarity in the world of business. In Japan, there is not a single self-made female billionaire, according to Forbes. In the United States and Europe, most women who are billionaires secured their wealth through inheritance.No country has more self-made female billionaires than China. The Communist Party, under Mao Zedong, promoted gender equality, allowing women to flourish after capitalism started to take hold, according to Huang Yasheng, an expert in China's entrepreneurial class and a professor of international management at M.I.T. And in a country with few established players, entrepreneurs like Ms. Zhou were able to quickly make their mark when they entered business in the 1990s as China's economic engine was revving up.Ms. Zhou's stake in Lens Technology, which went public this year, is worth $7.2 billion. That puts her fortune on par with the media tycoon John C. Malone and Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay.Ms. Zhou isn't a celebrity chieftain, like Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba. Few in China had even heard her name before her company's public offering this year. She rarely grants interviews or makes public appearances.An elegant woman with a cherubic face, owlish glasses and a preference for Christian Dior suits, Ms. Zhou is fastidious and demanding -- ""Sit up straight!"" she commands of a general manager during a meeting. Yet she exudes charm and humility, a quiet recognition that things could have easily turned out differently.""In the village where I grew up, a lot of girls didn't have a choice of whether to go to middle school. They would get engaged or married and spend their entire life in that village,"" she said in an interview at her office, where there was a wooden statue of Mao and a 27-inch desktop Mac. ""I chose to be in business, and I don't regret it.""Leaning Toward the ObsessiveThe youngest of three children, Ms. Zhou was born in a tiny village in the Hunan Province of central China, a farming community about two hours south of Changsha, the provincial capital. Her mother died when she was 5. Her father, a skilled craftsman, later lost a finger and most of his eyesight in an industrial accident.At home, she helped her family raise pigs and ducks for food and additional money. At school, she excelled.""She was a hard-working and talented student,"" Zhong Xiaobai, her former middle-school teacher, says. ""I once read her essay, 'My Mother,' aloud in class. It was so moving it brought everyone to tears.""Despite her academic focus, Ms. Zhou dropped out of school at 16 and traveled south to Guangdong province to live with her uncle's family and search for better work. While she dreamed of becoming a fashion designer, she eventually landed a job on a factory floor in the city of Shenzhen, making watch lenses for about $1 a day.The conditions, she said, were harsh. ""I worked from 8 a.m. to 12 a.m., and sometimes until 2 a.m.,"" Ms. Zhou recalled. ""There were no shifts, just a few dozen people, and we all polished glass. I didn't enjoy it.""After three months, she decided to quit and wrote a letter of resignation to her boss. In it, she complained about the hours and boredom. Even so, she expressed her gratitude for the job, saying she wanted to learn more.The letter impressed the factory chief, who told her the plant was about to adopt new processes. He asked her to stay, offering her a promotion. It was the first of several over the next three years.In 1993, Ms. Zhou, then 22, decided to set out on her own. With $3,000 in savings, she and several relatives started their own workshop next door. They lured customers with the promise of even higher-quality watch lenses.At the new company, Ms. Zhou did it all. She repaired and designed factory machinery. She taught herself complex screen-printing processes and difficult techniques that allowed her to improve prints for curved glass.""In the Hunan language, we call women like her 'ba de man,' which means a person who dares to do what others are afraid to do,"" said her cousin Zhou Xinyi, who helped her open the workshop and now serves on the Lens board.Along the way, Zhou Qunfei married her former factory boss, had a child and divorced. She later married a longtime factory colleague, who serves on the Lens board, and had a second child.Her work habits lean toward the obsessive. Her company's headquarters is at one of her manufacturing plants in Changsha. In her spacious office, a door behind her desk opens into a small apartment, ensuring she can roam the factory floor day or night.Propelled to DominanceIt was the mobile phone that made Ms. Zhou a billionaire.In 2003, she was still making glass for watches when she received an unexpected phone call from executives at Motorola. They asked if she was willing to help them develop a glass screen for their new device, the Razr V3.At the time, the display screens on most mobile phones were made of plastic. Motorola wanted a glass display that would be more resistant to scratches and provide sharper images for text messages, photos and multimedia.""I got this call, and they said, 'Just answer yes or no, and if the answer's yes, we'll help you set up the process,' "" Ms. Zhou recalled. ""I said yes.""Soon after, orders started rolling in from other mobile-phone makers like HTC, Nokia and Samsung. Then, in 2007, Apple entered the market with the iPhone, which had a keyboard-enabled glass touch screen that rewrote the rules of the game for mobile devices. Apple picked Lens as its supplier, propelling Ms. Zhou's company into a dominant position in China.After that, Ms. Zhou invested heavily in new facilities and hired skilled technicians. More than once, colleagues say, she put up her apartment as a guarantee for a new bank loan. Within five years, she had manufacturing plants under construction in three cities.""She's a passionate entrepreneur, and she's very hands-on,"" says James Hollis, an executive at Corning, which has a partnership with Lens Technology. ""I've watched her company grow, and her develop a strong team. Now there are over 100 competitors in this space, but Lens is a Tier 1 player.""Lens operates round the clock, with 75,000 workers spread across three main manufacturing facilities that occupy about 800 acres in the Changsha region. Each day, the company receives bulk shipments of glass from global manufacturers like Corning in the United States and Asahi Glass in Japan.The glass is cut, ground down to size, bored and polished to give each plate a transparent finish. Then the plates are strengthened in a potassium ion bath, painted and cured. Finally, they are cleaned and coated with anti-smudge and anti-reflection films.Ms. Zhou designs and choreographs nearly every step of the process, a detailed-oriented approach she traces to her childhood. ""My father had lost his eyesight, so if we placed something somewhere, it had to be in the right spot, exactly, or something could go wrong,"" she said. ""That's the attention to detail I demand at the workplace.""Lens has not experienced the kinds of labor troubles that have clouded other contract manufacturers like Foxconn. But current and former workers say the job is challenging. Much of the work is done by young women who inspect glass at different angles, trying to detect flaws.""As a quality inspector, I had to stare at those products all day long, so this is a tiring job,"" said Gao Zhimei, who recently left Lens Technology. ""But I should say that working in manufacturing is always tiring and working at Lens is not more tiring than working in other factories.""Expanding a Customer BaseLens Technology went public in March, as the Chinese stock market was booming. With the recent market collapse, the company has lost 45 percent in value, but it is still worth about $8 billion.Last year, the company notched revenue of about $2.4 billion. Profit rose 40 percent in the first quarter. But Lens gets nearly 75 percent of its revenue from Apple and Samsung, making the company reliant on just two customers. In May, at the first shareholders' meeting since the company went public, an investor pressed Lens about how it planned to maintain an edge in a hypercompetitive market that thrives on innovation.Several executives tried to answer the question. Then Ms. Zhou spoke up, saying she was prepared to diversify the company's business with production facilities geared toward higher-end glass, as well as sapphire and ceramic.After the meeting adjourned, investors piled into a bus and rode with Ms. Zhou to the Lens campus, less than a mile away. Ms. Zhou had sat quietly through much of the shareholders' meeting, but on the tour of the factory, she came alive. The shareholders hung on every word.",0.0
"Jets Drop Ball, and Watt Drops Jets:   [Sports Desk ]",,"HOUSTON -- The Jets tried holding on to their playoff aspirations Sunday, but they dropped them, like the deep balls botched by their rookie receiver. The Jets tried sustaining those aspirations, but they were depleted by every sack they allowed, every interception they threw, every dose of gadgetry that stunned them into mediocrity.No matter how Coach Todd Bowles chooses to spin their plight, the Jets are reeling, losers of four of their last five games. The ramifications of this latest flop, a 24-17 loss to the Houston Texans at NRG Stadium, radiated throughout the premises afterward.In the back of the locker room, the stall of the star cornerback Darrelle Revis, who was torched for a 61-yard touchdown in his worst game since rejoining the team, sat empty. He was being treated for symptoms of a concussion that could jeopardize his availability for next week's game against the Miami Dolphins.Toward the front, the rookie Devin Smith -- who butchered one long pass over the middle and then mangled what would have been a 46-yard touchdown -- sat facing his locker, head down, nodding along to the encouraging words of the receivers coach Karl Dorrell.In the interview room, Bowles's nostrils flared, and his eyes raged as he demolished his team for its failure to perform in critical situations. Told that he had expressed the same displeasure before, Bowles said: ""I'm not repeating myself. I'm just stating the obvious.""No longer are the Jets in command of a wild-card berth in the A.F.C., as they were a month ago. No longer are the Jets a prime contender for a postseason spot, as they were two weeks ago. No longer do the Jets have solid positioning on the periphery of the race, as they did 10 days ago.Through 10 games, the Jets are 5-5, an average record for an average team. Because of the ordinary A.F.C., the Jets remain in the hunt, resembling business travelers with meager airline status. They are sort of special, but not really.They believe that they are better than average, which could be true. Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, for one, noted his frustration with losing to teams ""that we feel like we're better than,"" though it was not immediately clear how long that list was. It is also just as possible that the Jets are worse than average.A full deconstruction of Sunday's mess will take place Monday, when Bowles and his staff will evaluate why the Texans looked like the fresher and more prepared team, despite having four fewer days of rest.And why the Jets failed to make the necessary adjustments to counter a backup quarterback, T. J. Yates, and the trickery deployed to minimize his limitations.And why Houston's two best players -- receiver DeAndre Hopkins, who burned Revis on that long score, and defensive end J. J. Watt, who had two sacks, five quarterback hits and five tackles for loss -- made a mockery of the notion that the Jets could contain them.In the aftermath, Bowles will also examine whether Fitzpatrick remains his best option at quarterback after interceptions on the Jets' last two drives stalled any hopes of a comeback. The issue was left unresolved Sunday.That Bowles did not immediately say Fitzpatrick would start next week suggests that Bowles is at least considering a change, even if he is unlikely to make one.""I'm still committed to Ryan,"" Bowles said. ""I just don't think he played very well, just like a lot of other people on both sides of the ball.""With the exception of long snapper Tanner Purdum and Randy Bullock, who made all three of his kicks, Bowles could have been speaking about anyone.With Houston starter Brian Hoyer sidelined, the Jets' defense buckled against Yates, who had thrown only 15 passes the last two seasons and had not started a game since January 2012. The Jets had professed not to care about Yates's inexperience, saying that they were preparing not for him but for Houston's scheme, which nonetheless managed to surprise them.The Texans unleashed the Wildcat formation, gaining two first downs on a 16-play drive that led to a field goal, and then a double pass from Yates to Cecil Shorts, who threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to an open Alfred Blue that snapped a 10-10 tie midway through the third quarter.Asked if he had seen that play before, cornerback Buster Skrine said, ""Never.""Asked if the Jets were caught off guard, Shorts said, ""They had no clue what to do.""There were other indictments, too, like Watt's persistent abuse of right tackle Breno Giacomini and anyone else the Jets tried to block him with, and Hopkins's unfolding a beach chair on Revis Island.""I play football,"" Hopkins said. ""Went out there and played my game. Nothing special.""That is also an apt description of the Jets' suddenly one-dimensional offense, which averaged 3.3 yards rushing on 21 carries and tends to rely too much on receiver Brandon Marshall, who short-armed one pass and was unable to corral a deep ball on the Jets' second series.The offensive coordinator Chan Gailey spoke last week of the importance of another player emerging. Given a chance, with the Jets trailing by 24-10 late in the third quarter, Smith struggled to track a perfect pass from Fitzpatrick that landed in his hands.""Our rookies got to stop being rookies,"" Bowles said, alluding to Smith, who against Buffalo fumbled a kickoff that was returned for a touchdown. ""They need to grow up. They get paid like everybody else. They got to start acting like they're not in college no more.""Those with far more experience contributed to the misery. In his return to Houston, where he spent 15 years working in the front office, Jets General Manager Mike Maccagnan watched the offense he assembled amass all of 57 first-half yards and, for a second consecutive game, score 3 first-half points.The Jets lacked precision. And energy. And yards. And points. And first downs. And third-down conversions.Asked to explain his unit's lethargic starts, Marshall suppressed his candor, pausing for 10 seconds before answering.""We just got to make plays,"" Marshall said.He paused for 13 more seconds before basically repeating himself, and then offered an assessment rarely spoken of teams that fashion themselves as contenders.""We're not playing good football,"" Marshall said, ""and that's everybody in the locker room.""EXTRA POINTSCenter Nick Mangold left after the Jets' second series with a deep gash to his right hand between his pinkie and ring finger. It required stitches, and he did not return. He said he was optimistic that he could play next week against Miami. ...Both of the Jets' 2013 first-round draft picks were inactive Sunday. Defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson was sidelined by a balky hamstring, while cornerback Dee Milliner, sick last week but listed on the injury report as probable, was a healthy scratch.Photograph Jets Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, Who Played with an Injured Left Hand, Being Tackled by Houston Defensive End J.

Going Online to Plead for Help:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"""I can't even believe I'm writing this, or asking for this, but this is the reality.""This appeal on GoFundMe appeared on Monday, like thousands of others showing up each day on that site and others like it. The Nowakowski siblings of Milwaukee were asking for $25,000 to help their parents, as their father struggled to pay for the care of their mother, who has dementia and mobility challenges and recently moved into an assisted-living home.Their biggest goal is a wheelchair-accessible van to restore some sense of normalcy to their parents' lives, allowing them to continue going to the farmers' market and to see their favorite band, the Whiskey Belles.The family's situation is not life or death, or even as severe as imminent eviction or lack of electricity, like some of the requests on older sites like Modest Needs.But it's not in the same category as art projects or entrepreneurial ventures either, such as those you'd see on Kickstarter. Charitable fund-raising campaigns or requests for race-for-the-cure pledges are a different type of plea, too.Instead, the increasing number of personal appeals like this represent a muddled middle, where people who do not have enough ask for help to make life better. The requests lie somewhere along the murky wants-versus-needs continuum, but it would be hard to agree on exactly where they sit.We are not used to this, the sheer nakedness of people putting a number to their problems and disclosing it to the world. But more financial transparency is almost always better than less, and the Internet provides an emboldening platform. Then, it is up to everyone to push the button to give money or not.Plenty of people are making the requests. GoFundMe plays host to about 3,300 new personal campaigns (as the company refers to them) each day. The most common category is medical expenses, followed by memorials and funerals, general emergencies and education costs.While not all requests are successful, people can keep whatever they take in, even if they don't hit their goal (and also if they exceed it). As of September, the askers had raised over $1 billion in the previous 12 months, though the for-profit company does take about 8 percent in fees for customers in North America. The money it transfers for personal campaigns is a gift, so the givers get no tax deduction, and the company does not guarantee that people are telling the truth. It urges people to give money only to those they ""know and trust.""So who are these people who are giving and taking?There is something appealing about the idea that this is ""really Midwestern,"" as a writer for the personal finance website The Billfold suggested earlier this year. Indeed, to the money-talk-isn't-polite crowd, crowdfunding is often something to sneer at. But those of us reared far from moneyed coastal communities keep right on with our barn raisings, virtual or otherwise.It apparently isn't always easy to figure out just how bold to encourage people to be, though. One service called Present Value began as a registry where engaged couples could just ask directly for cash in lieu of upgraded kitchen appliances and more traditional wedding gifts. The platform is still there, but the company has shifted its focus toward helping users figure out how to put the money they receive to work, whether in stocks or college savings.Those gift requests were strictly wants. Other kinds of requests that are further down the necessity continuum began appearing on sites like Indiegogo a few years ago and complicated the proceedings. Yet it didn't make much sense for users to see requests for help with something like fertility treatments next to fledgling art projects in need of money.Plus, the branding was all wrong. ""Indie"" suggests filmmaking, and ""go go"" suggests movement and dancing, not eggs and sperm that are having trouble meeting -- let alone funeral expenses or missed college tuition payments. Indiegogo has now moved the more acute financial requests to Generosity.com.One advantage that all such sites offer is that you don't have to look anyone in the eye when making your request. You can ask everyone without having to ask anyone in particular. It's also less aggressive than making a one-on-one plea.Or perhaps it's just passive-aggressive. There is always the possibility that the person who is asking is making a list and checking it twice (and then 50 times more) to see who has pitched in and who has not. But Dana Nowakowski, who made the van appeal with her brother, Luke, said that she was not doing that at all.""I dreaded doing it,"" she said. ""I've been writing it in my head every morning for the last couple of weeks, in the shower, getting ready, just dreading writing this story.""So why do it? ""There is an element of desperation,"" she said. Hers, she explained, is a family that does not ask for things. They work for what they get and they buy what they can afford and that's just how it has always been. They do not expect things or feel entitled to them.But her parents, she said, had done so much for so many people for so long, baking cookies and making casseroles and giving rides and handing out gift cards. Her father is a retired teacher. And few people knew just how desperate things had become in recent weeks, when her mother moved into the dementia care home and the costs became clear. ""They were the first ones there for friends and family,"" she said. ""So I guess I kind of thought, 'Hey, it's their turn. It's time for everyone to return the favor.""'In an odd coincidence, Ms. Nowakowski works as a writer for an ad agency. So was this just another ""campaign,"" as GoFundMe puts it, except one where she had to sell her family's plight? ""Selling implies exaggerating, calculating, sometimes even manipulating the truth,"" she said. ""The sad truth is I didn't have to sell anything. This crappy situation sells itself.""Even introducing the idea of commerce here, however, ought to make us all deeply uncomfortable. Is this what we've been reduced to, weighing pitches for charity from people we know and pitting them against strangers online, or the needy whom more traditional charities serve?What was I to make of my own cynicism as I found myself deep in the weeds on these sites this week, evaluating a newly fatherless child. Should I support her, given that I was pretty sure that a seven-figure settlement would be coming her way because of the circumstances of her father's accidental death?So here's another way to think about these sites. They don't replace traditional charity, or obviate the obligation to vote and lobby for policy changes that could reduce many of the needs they serve. But they can allow you to honor your own family's history of having been helped by letting you pay back those who have supported you in the past, or toss the rope to others who are in circumstances similar to ones that you once found yourself in.That, at least, is how family, friends and fans of the Nowakowskis seem to be seeing it. As of this writing, they've raised $20,830, more than 80 percent of their goal. And Ms. Nowakowski said she didn't feel a shred of regret.""The support we're getting from this is just as important to me as the money,"" she said. ""You can really feel the love, the warmth, the fact that people have your back. And that's what we needed the most.""Make the most of your money.

Risks: Beware Blood Pressure Shifts:   [Science Desk ],,"Large variations in blood pressure readings from one doctor's appointment to another are associated with cardiovascular disease and death, a new study has found.Researchers used data from more than 25,000 people participating in a study of medicines for hypertension. They took seven blood pressure readings during months six to 28 of the study and then followed the patients for an average of 2.8 more years. The study is in Annals of Internal Medicine.Compared with those in the lowest one-fifth for variability in systolic blood pressure readings, those in the highest one-fifth were 30 percent more likely to die of cardiovascular disease or have a nonfatal heart attack, 46 percent more likely to have a stroke, 25 percent more likely to have heart failure, and 58 percent more likely to die from any cause. The researchers controlled for age, sex, race, smoking, diabetes and other factors.While the study found an association, it does not prove cause and effect.""We usually use average blood pressure as a measure, because reducing that has led to reduced risk. The fluctuations get dismissed,"" said the lead author, Paul Muntner, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. ""But variability in blood pressure appears to be a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and it may be an important thing for doctors to look at.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Graph Graphic",0.0
"Nagasaki, the Forgotten City:   Commentary",,"ON Aug. 9, 1945, the United States dropped a nuclear bomb on Nagasaki, situated on a long, narrow bay on Japan's southernmost main island, Kyushu.From the beginning, this attack was different than the atomic bombing of Hiroshima three days earlier, yet the experiences of the two cities have been fused in memory, to the point that we use the term ""the bomb"" to refer to both events. The result has been to consign Nagasaki to the edge of oblivion.Many Americans believe their government's official narrative: that the two bombs, dropped in close succession, led to Japan's surrender. But it is now well known that the surrender was prompted at least as much by the Soviet Union's decision to join the Allies in the war against Japan. Just 11 hours before the Nagasaki bombing, 1.5 million Soviet troops crossed into the Japanese puppet state in Manchuria, in northern China, and attacked the depleted Japanese Army there on three fronts.The United States expected the Soviet action, but the delivery of the second atomic bomb was not dependent on the timing of the Soviet invasion, Tokyo's response, or even a specific order from President Harry S. Truman. His sole directive had been to use nuclear weapons on Japan ""as made ready"" -- and on Aug. 8, the second bomb's assembly was complete.The next morning -- 30 minutes before the Nagasaki bombing -- Japan's Supreme War Council convened to try yet again to find agreement on surrender terms. Stalin's declaration of war had ended any last hope of Soviet help in attaining more favorable surrender terms.Council members pressing for immediate surrender were gravely concerned about lack of food and supplies for Japanese troops, the dire domestic situation and the Hiroshima bombing. Militarists were willing to fight to the death for the guaranteed preservation of Emperor Hirohito's postwar sovereignty. When news of the Nagasaki attack arrived, the deliberations continued without further mention of it. That night, Hirohito broke the deadlock and sanctioned surrender.In the United States, Nagasaki was overshadowed by Hiroshima from the very start. While the first atomic bombing gained headlines, the Nagasaki bombing shared the day's news with the Soviet advance. In a radio address on the evening of Aug. 9, Truman outlined a political and economic framework for postwar Europe. He referred to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima only once, but did not mention Nagasaki.About 74,000 people in Nagasaki died instantaneously or within five months of the bombing. Only 150 were military personnel. Another 75,000 people were injured, and these numbers do not count those who fell ill and died from radiation-related conditions in the decades to come.Initially, purple spots appeared on their bodies, their hair fell out, and they developed high fevers, infections, and swollen and bleeding gums. Later, cancer rates surged. The survivors, known as hibakusha, lived in constant fear of illness and death.The United States suppressed this part of the story. In the fall of 1945, high-level American officials rebutted news reports of deaths from radiation exposure. For years to come, the occupation authorities censored news accounts, photographs, scientific research and personal testimonies about the attacks.To counter growing criticism of the bombings, American leaders established a narrative that the bombings had ended the war and saved up to 1 million American lives by preventing an invasion of Japan. (These postwar casualty estimates were far higher than pre-bomb calculations.) Most Americans accepted this narrative.Few Americans know much about Nagasaki. A center for trade in the late 1500s, it was the vanguard for the nation's early modernization and the hub for Catholic missionary outreach. When Japan officially banned Christianity in 1614, then closed its borders to outside contact from the 1630s to the late 1850s, Nagasaki alone was allowed to continue limited international trade, providing the city's growing population exposure to Asian and European arts, science and literature. Nagasaki continued to thrive after Japan re-established diplomatic relations with the West, becoming the third largest shipbuilding city in the world. Christians who had long hidden their faith re-emerged, and Nagasaki became the home of the largest Catholic church in East Asia. An estimated 10,000 Catholics died in the 1945 bombing.Sumiteru Taniguchi, 16, was delivering mail on his bicycle in the northwestern corner of the city when the force of the explosion hurled him into the air. Even from a mile away, the searing heat instantly disintegrated his cotton shirt and burned the skin off his entire back and one arm. Three months later, he was finally taken to a naval hospital 22 miles north of the city, where he lay on his stomach for more than three years, begging the nurses to let him die. Later, after he had learned to sit, stand and ultimately walk again, Mr. Taniguchi seethed in anger at what he believed was the unnecessary nuclear devastation of his city and its people.Over the past 70 years, Mr. Taniguchi and tens of thousands of other hibakusha have navigated punishing injuries, late-onset radiation-related illnesses, and haunting fears that they would pass on genetic disorders to their children and grandchildren. Many never speak about their atomic bomb experiences, even within their families. In a remarkable act of resilience, however, Mr. Taniguchi and a small number of hibakusha made the very personal choice, some as early as the mid-1950s, to speak publicly about their survival.They do not tell their stories to promote Japan's victimization, or to minimize the attack on Pearl Harbor, or the suffering and deaths of Asian civilians and Allied military personnel at the hands of brutal Japanese soldiers. Rather, they speak to eliminate ignorance about the realities of nuclear war and to eradicate nuclear stockpiles across the globe.The official narrative remains the dominant opinion of most Americans. In that story, Nagasaki fades in memory; we should not let it. Our time to understand the survivors' experience of nuclear war is running out. Only they can tell us what it was like, and their lives are coming to an end.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.AuthorAffiliation SUSAN SOUTHARD Susan Southard is the author of ""Nagasaki: Life After Nuclear War.""",0.0

U.S. Is Seeking Felony Pleas by Big Banks:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"The Justice Department is pushing some of the biggest banks on Wall Street -- including, for the first time in decades, American institutions -- to plead guilty to criminal charges that they manipulated the prices of foreign currencies.In the final stages of a long-running investigation into corruption in the world's largest financial market, federal prosecutors have recently informed Barclays, JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Citigroup that they must enter guilty pleas to settle the cases, according to lawyers briefed on the matter. The pleas would be likely to carry a symbolic stigma, if limited actual fallout, in handing felony convictions to some of the world's biggest banks.Yet even as those cases head toward negotiations over potential plea deals -- a development that has not been previously reported -- additional currency misconduct has surfaced in a New York state investigation, confidential documents show. The documents, excerpts from online chat rooms reviewed by The New York Times, suggest that banks designed electronic trading platforms that effectively drove up the price of currencies sold to clients. In the chats, replete with expletives and industry jargon, employees described and even joked about how the platform would cancel trades that ceased to be profitable for the bank.New York's financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, initially focused on platforms at Barclays and Deutsche Bank, but he has since subpoenaed four other banks: Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas and Société Générale. None of the banks have been accused of wrongdoing, and they are cooperating with the investigation.The Justice Department's plea deals, if ultimately reached, would not cover any wrongdoing that surfaces from Mr. Lawsky's investigation. Negotiations with the Justice Department are likely to center on which entity will plead guilty: the bank's parent company, or a subsidiary that housed the misconduct. The banks, which have argued that the wrongdoing was isolated to midlevel employees, prefer that a subsidiary take the fall.The currency case is expected to ensnare traders but not top-level executives. As a result, it may add fuel to the criticism that prosecutors have not charged one top executive on Wall Street. Without charges to mollify the public anger over the financial crisis, the recent cases have presented little more than a pyrrhic victory for the Justice Department.Still, the developments underscore a broader reality on Wall Street of late: One investigation begets another. With each settlement for money laundering, manipulating interest rates or aiding tax fraud, new cases crop up, often unearthed in the course of the previous investigation.The currency investigation would expand on those cases, which produced guilty pleas only from foreign banks. In pursuing cases last year against those foreign banks, Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas, prosecutors confronted the popular belief that banks had grown so important to the economy that they could not be charged.After those deals set off few if any practical repercussions -- the stocks of the banks actually jumped following the news -- prosecutors in the currency case are now demanding pleas from JPMorgan and Citigroup, the lawyers said, in addition to Barclays of Britain and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The banks, before entering a guilty plea for any entity, will likely seek assurances that the charges would not prompt a revocation of their licenses or cost them any major business lines. If the banks resist, the Justice Department has warned that an indictment and ultimately a trial await.For the Justice Department, the currency case represents a last opportunity to shape the white-collar legacy of Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who has announced plans to step down once his replacement is confirmed. Blamed for the lack of criminal cases against Wall Street executives, Mr. Holder has emphasized that ""no financial institution, at home or abroad, is too powerful to be held accountable for wrongdoing.""A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment, as did all of the banks under investigation. The lawyers briefed on the investigations spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private settlement talks.The Justice Department and the banks, the lawyers said, will most likely take weeks or even months to negotiate a settlement. The deals could be announced in close succession, if not on the same day.The currency investigation began in earnest two years ago with the suspicion that traders across Wall Street manipulated the foreign exchange market, pushing prices up and down to suit their own holdings. Although foreign exchange is an enormous global market, with more than $5 trillion changing hands each day, it is one of the least regulated.Banks eventually fired dozens of traders implicated in the scheme. Authorities around the globe scrambled to stake a claim to the investigation.In November, six banks sought to close the first chapter of the case, agreeing to pay a combined $4.25 billion to settle with financial regulators in Washington and Britain. The settlement, which included JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, the Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and HSBC, exposed the way banks colluded to manipulate currencies through emails and online chat rooms.""He's sat back in his chair... feet on desk... announcing to desk... that's why I got the bonus pool,"" one trader remarked to a rival after they colluded on a rate, earning, according to regulators, a profit of $513,000 on the trade. Traders who collaborated to rig the market called themselves ""the Players"" and ""the Three Musketeers.""On the eve of the settlement, Barclays withdrew from the deal over concerns that it would not completely resolve its liabilities. The bank had hoped that Mr. Lawsky's agency would join the pact.Now that the Justice Department has opened settlement talks in the case, demanding guilty pleas for antitrust and fraud charges, Mr. Lawsky is likely to join. Each agency will assess its own fines, the lawyers briefed on the matter said.The Justice Department might also pursue its own investigation into the electronic trading platforms under scrutiny by Mr. Lawsky, the lawyers said. Unlike the original currency investigation, which centered on the behavior of individual traders who altered currency prices to benefit their own positions, Mr. Lawsky's inquiry suspects a more systematic gaming of the currency markets through electronic trading platforms.Over the last decade, many banks began to trade currencies through electronic platforms. Not all such platforms were meant to benefit the banks at the client's expense.But late last year, Mr. Lawsky's agency began to scrutinize the platforms at Deutsche Bank and Barclays, as Bloomberg News reported in December.In the confidential documents reviewed by The Times, it appeared that at least one bank steered certain clients to its platform, which provided the bank a moment to weigh its options in an otherwise high-speed environment.For example, once a client agreed to buy euros at a certain price from a bank, the platform would detect whether the market had suddenly moved in a way that made the trade less profitable for the bank. The platform would then allow the bank to cancel the trade, possibly setting up a chance for the bank to eventually process the trade at a higher price.In the online chat rooms, bank employees mocked their clients for not detecting the setup. And in some cases, when clients inquired about the cancellation, the banks falsely blamed a technical glitch.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Photograph Attorney General Eric Holder, Who Will Soon Step Down, has Been Faulted for a Lack of Cases Against Wall Street Executives.

"Paid Notice: Deaths STATON, ALBERT H.:   [Paid Death Notice ]",,"STATON--Albert H.,Jr. Albert H. Staton, Jr. died peacefully Wednesday, July 29th at home in Coral Gables, FL, age 94. He had recently celebrated 72 years of marriage to his beloved wife and life partner, Mary Jane Staton (nee Wilson). Born April 1, 1921 in Atlanta, GA, Albert was a successful international businessman who spent much of his working life in Latin America. A brilliant student, he passed the admission exam at Georgia Tech at the age of 15 but was told to wait a year because of his youth. After earning a BS in Chemical Engineering from Georgia Tech in 1941, Albert served in the US Army for four years, first in chemical munitions and later as an intelligence officer with the 77th Infantry Division in the Pacific. He was promoted to the rank of captain on Okinawa, where he received the Bronze Star. In 1951, Albert moved with his family to Colombia to work for Panamerican Investment Company (Panamco) a pioneering softdrink company founded by his father. During his many years with Panamco in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil, Albert was instrumental in building it into one of the largest and best-run Coca-Cola bottling companies outside the US. One of his proudest achievements was the construction of an immense bottling plant in Jundiai, Brazil, that was at the time large enough to supply the entire city of Sao Paolo. Panamco became a public company in 1998 and was acquired by Coca-Cola FEMSA five years later. Albert will be remembered for his optimism, his wit, his multilingualism and his ability to think outside the box. He loved to tell tales of derring-do about his extraordinarily adventurous life. He was passionately interested in world affairs and up to the time of his death perused several newspapers every morning, including The New York Times and the Financial Times. He was also a devoted husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather and friend. He is survived by his wife Mary Jane, also of Atlanta; his son Albert III and daughter Jane; seven grandchildren and three great- grandchildren. His beloved son Stuart died in 2013. 1/3",0.0

"A Mother of Three, Fighting Evictions:   [National Desk ]",,"Gardenia Valerio's two-bedroom apartment in the Soundview section of the Bronx, steps from the Bruckner Expressway, was welcoming and calm.As soon as Ms. Valerio's three children returned from finishing their homework after school at a nearby licensed day care center, a wave of energy washed over the apartment.Ms. Valerio, who was born in the Dominican Republic, speaks some English but feels more comfortable when her children get extra help with their English while doing their homework. Her oldest child, Valeria, 9, proudly shared a student-of-the-month certificate she was awarded.Small hands quickly scooped up toys, including the accessories to a dollhouse that has two tiny cribs, one for a boy and one for a girl. Ms. Valerio's 5-year-old twins, Ashley and Rafael, and Valeria played games on tablets and on Ms. Valerio's smartphone.She made macaroni and cheese as her children settled in for the evening, changing from their school uniforms to more casual clothing.They comfortably made their way from room to room, secure in their surroundings. But it was only five years ago that Ms. Valerio, now 30, and her children did not have a place to call their own. Her relationship with her partner had deteriorated, and they fell behind in the rent. While pregnant with her twins, she was evicted.She went to her mother's house, where she ended up staying for a few years. Later, she found an apartment on the same block as the one she had been evicted from earlier. Ms. Valerio got work as a home health aide, only to have her hours reduced. In March, facing eviction for a second time, she turned to Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.Catholic Charities negotiated with Ms. Valerio's landlord to cut her rent to $1,175, from $1,400, and paid the back rent she owed, helping her avoid eviction proceedings that were pending in court. She also received help with a Family Eviction Prevention Supplement. With $900 a month from the program, her rent was reduced to $275.Ms. Valerio lived in Puerto Rico before moving to the Bronx, where she dropped out of high school without fully mastering English. She now plans to earn her high school equivalency diploma, improve her English and eventually train to become a medical assistant.Catholic Charities used $379.53 from the Neediest Cases Fund to pay for markers, crayons and backpacks for her children for school.Ms. Valerio said through a Spanish interpreter that she had drawn strength and motivation from her children. They relied on her, she said, so she could not let them down.Their father visits occasionally, but he is not a consistent, dependable figure in the children's lives. She is raising them largely on her own. Ms. Valerio said she was a single parent, but that with her children, she had a family.Photograph Gardenia Valerio, 30, a Native of the Dominican Republic, with Her Children, Valeria, 9, and Twins Ashley and Rafael, 5, in Their Apartment in the Soundview Section of the Bronx.

"Britain: Assange Duty Is Draining Police Coffers, London Chief Says:   [Brief ]",,"London's police chief said Tuesday that the cost of keeping watch on Julian Assange, who is holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy there, was draining resources and must be reviewed.

Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe told LBC Radio that officials were considering ""how we can do that differently in the future, because it's sucking our resources in.""

Rights Group Weighs New Stance on Prostitution:   [Foreign Desk ],,"PARIS -- The question of what should be done about prostitution is as old as the profession itself, but the issue is now front and center again, as a leading human rights group proposes decriminalization, while some countries push toward harsher penalties for those who pay for sex.In France, England and Ireland, lawmakers are considering new measures -- and in the cases of Northern Ireland and Canada, are enforcing new laws -- that impose penalties on clients, using a model adopted in Sweden in 1999.But the effort to crack down on a largely male clientele while sheltering a mostly female work force is taking place just as the human rights group Amnesty International is advocating a new course: decriminalizing all prostitution, both for buyers and sellers.At an international conference next week in Dublin, about 500 Amnesty delegates from more than 80 countries will vote on whether to advocate the elimination of all penalties for prostitution, based on ""evidence that the criminalization of adult sex work can lead to increased human rights violations against sex workers."" The proposal has been denounced by women's groups like the New York-based Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, and celebrities like Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet and Gloria Steinem.""Prostitution has always been considered a domestic matter, and now Amnesty could elevate it to a point of international human rights law,"" said Francis A. Boyle, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois and a former Amnesty board member in the United States. He called that development ""significant.""""But why is the resolution so broad?"" he asked. ""Everything should be organized around that basic principle of protecting the women and girls. We should be protecting human beings, and not sex work.""In June, the French National Assembly voted to support a law to penalize clients of prostitutes. The legislation still faces a vote in the Senate. Last month, Northern Ireland started enforcing new regulations that carry 1,000-pound fines (about $1,500) and prison terms for buyers. Canada instituted similar laws this year. Politicians in England and Ireland are also exploring the so-called Swedish or Nordic model to make paying for sex a crime. Sweden passed its law focusing on buyers 16 years ago, and street prostitution in major Swedish cities has dropped by more than half since 1995. The number of men who said they purchased sex fell, as well, by more than 40 percent in that period, according to a report this year by a Swedish government agency.But Amnesty International, formed in 1961 to bring attention to political prisoners, argues for a different approach in a leaked proposal that has circulated widely. That document contends that sexual desire is a fundamental need and that punishing buyers ""may amount to a violation of the right to privacy and undermine the rights to free expression and health."" The group also cites the benefits for buyers with physical and psychological disabilities who ""feel safe to express their sexuality"" and ""develop a stronger sense of self with their relationships with sex workers.""Amnesty also sides with the argument, made recently by prostitutes in France, that penalizing customers would drive prostitution further underground, making the workers more vulnerable to dangers.The policy vote comes as greater attention is being paid to human trafficking, which often results in forced prostitution, or prostitution as a means of survival. Pope Francis has been outspoken on the issue, calling it a plague on humanity and urging legislation to penalize traffickers and help victims recover.The decriminalization stance has roiled some of Amnesty's two million paying members. Some complain that the draft policy was conceived at Amnesty's headquarters in London. Over the last two years, various versions have been reviewed by the organization's national chapters, and a consensus emerged supporting decriminalization for just the prostitutes, according to minutes of organizational meetings. Amnesty says it has refined its proposal even further, but declined to release the latest version because it is an internal document.The issues raised by the Swedish model are all relevant, said Thomas Schultz-Jagow, a London spokesman for Amnesty, who added that the organization is not discounting them.""We are looking at decriminalization of sex work in a very comprehensive way that goes beyond the Nordic model,"" he said. ""We have looked at the pros and cons of various models."" If a majority approve the decriminalization proposal at next week's conference, it will be shaped into a final form by Amnesty's board. The stance will not have any immediate impact, except it will be the organization's official position as it lobbies on issues in various countries.Nevertheless, women's groups have been sharply critical, arguing that such a position by an organization of Amnesty's stature could sway policy and ultimately result in legalized brothels and owners free to recruit women from poorer countries as prostitutes.""It really undermines the whole concept of human rights to call it the rights of men to buy other human beings for sex,"" said Jessica Neuwirth, a former Amnesty member and the founder of Equality Now, an international women's rights group.She said there are suspicions among the opposition groups that the sex industry helped shape the proposal.Last year, Amnesty's British chapter issued a denial in response to questions about the role of Douglas Fox, who works in the sex industry and claimed credit for pressing for decriminalization through the chapter in Newcastle, England. Amnesty said, though, that he had not been a member for years and had ""zero input"" on its sex work proposal.In an interview, Mr. Fox described himself as a male escort. After joining Amnesty in 2008, he said that he lobbied the group to decriminalize prostitution. He said he quit the organization the following year after it sent him letters asking him to stop promoting himself as a member.""The fact that they are looking to decriminalize is basically what we were proposing,"" he said. ""They are supporting it for all the same reasons."" He added that targeting buyers amounted to ""manufactured moral panic."" He said: ""They think that if you are a foreign sex worker that you are trafficked. We feel they are actually economic migrants.""Niki Adams, a spokeswoman for the English Collective of Prostitutes in London, said that her group has submitted information to Amnesty's chapters in England and Scotland to support decriminalization for all. The organization, which represents women in the sex industry, has also organized a petition drive.""The really crucial element,"" she said, ""is that it defines sex workers as exchanging sex for money as opposed to characterizing them as victims of violence.""But some former prostitutes say they feel betrayed. Rachel Moran, the author of ""Paid For,"" which describes her seven-year experience as a prostitute in Ireland, is involved with a group organizing to oppose Amnesty's proposal.""It's wrong because decriminalizing pimps and johns has been shown to massively inflate the market,"" she said. ""With an inflated market you have more abusers and, as an obvious consequence, more abuse. This has played out in Nevada, Australia, New Zealand, Holland, Germany and everywhere else the sex trade has been legalized.""Photograph Opponents of Prostitution Outside the French National Assembly in Paris in June, When Lawmakers Voted to Penalize People Who Pay for Sex.

Take Your Pick: Fast Talker Or Smooth Talker:   [Review ],,"Judging ""Sneaky Pete,"" which stars Giovanni Ribisi as a con man and recent ex-con hiding out in upstate New York, has a lot to do with context. As an Amazon pilot -- it's one of two, along with ""Casanova,"" going up on Friday -- it looks kind of ordinary, surprisingly like a broadcast network drama. Semi-episodic, slightly procedural, light dusting of dark humor.But set it against the backdrop of the network pilots for this fall, and it takes on a shine. If it were part of that crowd, it would be on everyone's lists of the most promising new shows.""Sneaky Pete"" was written by David Shore, the creator of ""House M.D.,"" and Mr. Ribisi's Marius a.k.a. Pete has a House-like quality: He's an exceptionally skilled observer, which is how he's able to take on the identity of his former cellmate and fool the man's grandparents and cousins, who haven't seen him since he was a child.Marius is in debt to a New York heavy (played by Bryan Cranston of ""Breaking Bad,"" who's also an executive producer) and hopes to avoid him by becoming Pete. He quickly wins the confidence of his new grandparents (Peter Gerety and the ubiquitous Margo Martindale) and an attractive cousin (Marin Ireland), but suffers a comic reversal when he learns that the ""bond"" business his cellmate recalled involves posting bail for suburban criminals rather than trading on Wall Street.Pete's con-man abilities turn out to be well suited to tracking down bail jumpers, though -- one sort of fugitive chasing another -- and by the end of the episode he's joined the family business as well as the family, a point put across not very subtly in some Rockwellian tableaus. Grandma appears to have doubts, however, which are expertly communicated by Ms. Martindale with a few appraising glances.Seth Gordon (""Horrible Bosses,"" ""The Goldbergs""), who directed the pilot, has a taste for the obvious -- whenever Pete notices a detail helpful to his ruse, the camera pulls in on Mr. Ribisi so that we'll notice it too -- but he maintains a brisk pace and a not quite breezy, not quite serious tone appropriate to Mr. Shore's script. And the cast is good, with Mr. Ribisi convincingly charming as the con man with a heart.The second Amazon effort, ""Casanova,"" is the first episodic work by the French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, known for the visual flourish of films like ""City of Lost Children"" and ""Amélie."" On a TV budget he gives us a bright, attractive production with pretty costumes and wigs but nothing very distinctive to look at -- a short early scene on the roof of a Venetian prison is the only moment that makes you wonder what you'll see next.The script by Stu Zicherman (""The Americans,"" ""What About Brian"") imagines Casanova as an 18th-century operative assigned to use his bedroom skills to spy on the French king's mistress, Madame Pompadour (Bojana Novakovic), who's seen as a threat to the state. The opportunities for intrigue and humor in that situation are underutilized; instead we get a proto-feminist Casanova as an excuse to show naked young women being pawed by men, and an enlightened Casanova as an excuse to show the excesses of the ancien régime, including a man being drawn and quartered.Adding to the general blandness and inconsequence is the lead performance by Diego Luna, still best known for ""Y Tu Mamá También."" We're assured that his character is the paramount seducer and adventurer of his time, but Mr. Luna's cautious performance has neither heat nor soul. In the currently crowded ranks of costume dramas, this ""Casanova"" is easy to resist.Photograph Sneaky Pete: Giovanni Ribisi Stars As a Con Man Posing As His Former Prison Cellmate in This Amazon Pilot, Set to Begin Streaming On Friday.; Casanova, a Second Pilot From Amazon That Starts Friday, Features Diego Luna in the Lead Role.

"After Penalty, Fiat Chrysler Profit Falls 3%:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDED. DETROIT -- Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said on Wednesday that profits at its American subsidiary fell 3 percent in the second quarter, primarily because of a record civil penalty against the company for violating federal safety laws.The subsidiary, which encompasses operations of the former Detroit automaker Chrysler, reported net income of $598 million for the quarter compared with $619 million in the same period a year ago.The decrease was attributed to a charge of $90 million for fines agreed to with federal regulators, as well as a $71 million charge to extinguish debt.Last week, Fiat Chrysler signed a consent order with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to resolve the government's wide-ranging investigation of 23 vehicle recalls covering more than 11 million vehicles.The order called for a cash fine of $70 million and a commitment by the company to spend $20 million to satisfy safety performance requirements, including buying back defective vehicles.Fiat Chrysler could be assessed another $15 million in penalties if further safety violations are discovered by an independent monitor, according to the order.Last week, the company's chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said the Chrysler subsidiary had committed to overhaul its safety practices and recall procedures. ""We need to comply 100 percent of the time,"" he said.While its results dropped from a year ago, Chrysler remains the Italian-American automaker's most profitable business unit.Revenue for the subsidiary, which include Chrysler's North American and international operations, rose 11 percent during the quarter, to $22.6 billion.Its worldwide vehicle sales increased 5 percent, to 780,000, in the quarter, from a year earlier. The subsidiary ended the quarter with a United States market share of 12.4 percent, which represented a slight increase from the second quarter in 2014.The subsidiary also improved its cash position during the period, ending the quarter with net cash -- excluding financial liabilities -- of $2.1 billion. At the end of the first quarter, it had about $1.2 billion.",0.0
Luxembourg Tries for an Image Makeover:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"Luxembourg, the country once known as the European ""Death Star"" of financial secrecy, is looking to improve its image.Buffeted by the accusations that it was helping multinational corporations evade billions of dollars in taxes, the country has embarked on a long-term rebranding effort that the government hopes will help the world see it with different eyes.The effort has yet to yield a catchy slogan, but it may not matter. Unless you remember similar exercises that centered on the themes ""The eternal and fascinating Romania,"" or ""I feel SLOVEnia,"" your image of Luxembourg is probably set.This is not the view of a cynical resident or just another analyst. This is the opinion of the man who coined the phrase ""nation branding"" in the 1990s, Simon Anholt.""There is just no evidence that it has ever succeeded in changing the image of a country,"" Mr. Anholt, a policy advisor, said by telephone. ""People recognize it for what it is: state propaganda from a foreign government.""Mr. Anholt said the so-called Luxleaks scandal, in which leaked documents revealing that the government had helped some 300 corporations including Microsoft, Disney and Koch Industries, dodge billions of dollars in taxes, would do more to determine Luxembourg's image than a marketing campaign.""If Luxembourg wants to replace its negative image with a positive image, it would have to do something really good and do it consistently for a long long time,"" he said.Luxembourg, however, believes in branding. The state secretary, Francine Closener, points out that it worked for Switzerland. Because of Swiss marketing, she said, the country is identified with things besides its financial center.""We only started doing this now, because we didn't think it was necessary for a long time,"" she said. ""It wasn't very important to us if we were known in the world and why -- because we were doing fine.""The country has been aware of its tarnished reputation for some time. The previous government, under Jean-Claude Juncker, established a panel made up of the representatives of the monarchy, several ministries and two public-private agencies that promote business to spearhead the branding effort.The panel hired two marketing agencies which conducted surveys and focus groups to determine how residents perceived their country and what it could promote. The project is expected to cost almost one million euros, or just over $1 million, in 2016, when a marketing campaign will begin.The surveys were conducted by the country's statistics agency and the answers submitted showed that Luxembourg was seen as ""reliable, dynamic and open,"" the government announced. These preliminary results will help frame the marketing campaign, it said.But while local products like wine and sausage will be promoted as part of the campaign, it is the financial industry -- as the country's largest -- that remains at the center. This year alone, the group Luxembourg for Finance embarked on so-called financial missions in places like Dubai, Sweden, Canada and China. It also hosted the Luxembourg Renminbi Forum and plans to host an Islamic finance workshop this week.The government has also turned to the public to help improve the country's international standing. Voters were asked in a referendum this year to give voting rights to foreigners, who make up around 46 percent of the country's population. Not only would Luxembourg been the first European Union member to do so, but supporters also saw it as a way to promote the country as a business location. But 80 percent of Luxembourgers voted no.Mario Hirsch, a political scientist, said such marketing campaigns are ""made to divert, to keep people from questioning things.""""To me, nation branding is a smokescreen behind which business can go on as usual,"" said Mr. Hirsch, a visiting senior research fellow at the European Union Institute for Security Studies in Paris, added that that does not mean that ""business as usual is necessarily bad or wrong.""Some believe the country's bad image is a result of an outside smear campaign.""The things we are accused of are things that are practiced by other and larger nations which, of course, don't go at each other but choose to point the finger at us, a small nation, and find support in doing so, because we are doing so well,"" said Emile Haag, author of ""The Rise of Luxembourg from Independence to Success.""A local arts collective has a different view. Richtung22, known for poking fun at national treasures, staged a satirical communication campaign and theater piece about Luxembourg, portraying it as a regressive half-democracy with an industry based on the motto, ""It's not illegal if you do it in Luxembourg.""""How absurd is it to say Luxembourg is open, dynamic and reliable?"" says Lars Schmitz, a member of the collective.Before Luxembourg, it was the former Soviet nations that were best known for rebranding as they entered the global marketplace. Ukraine has made several branding attempts since its independence in 1991. Slogans like ""Ukraine. All about U"" and ""Ukraine. For snowlovers"" painted a portrait of a holiday destination both fun and cozy, far from its Soviet bleakness.After the breakup of the Soviet Union, countries all over Eastern Europe and the Balkans paid marketers for a new start. In addition to the Romania and Slovenia campaigns, there was Albania's ""A New Mediterranean Love,"" the government's effort to attract tourists and foreign investment.Only one year after splitting from Serbia, Kosovo hired BBR Saatchi & Saatchi in 2009 to come up with a brand for the country. The result was ""The Young Europeans,"" a campaign with a video showing young adults collectively building a Kosovo-shaped puzzle on a sunny day. The effort cost the government [euro]5.7 million, a considerable expenditure for the poor Balkan country.Regardless of how Luxembourg's campaign fares, it can be secure in the fact that it already ranks higher than the United States, Japan and Israel on Mr. Anholt's new Good Country Index, which evaluates how each nation takes care of security, health care, climate issues, equality and other issues.""The reality,"" Mr. Anholt said, ""is that it probably deserves a better reputation than it has now acquired for itself.""Photograph Corporations Like Amazon and Ebay Moved Some Operations to Luxembourg, Which Helped Them Avoid Paying Some Taxes.

""Thirty-two points on 12 shots is crazy.""Isaac Copeland scored 11 of Georgetown's first 22 points, helping the Hoyas jump out to a 6-point lead midway through the first.

""Grayson kept us in the ballgame. We could have been blown out of there.""A 3-pointer by Allen, a sophomore guard, with 2 minutes 45 seconds left put Duke up by 8, but Georgetown kept fighting.

"Volume by Volume, Some of Them Purloined, an Investment in Pakistan Continues:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- After his father died, Ahmad Saeed took over the office on the ground floor of the family's storied bookstore here, Saeed Book Bank. Then the elderly men started visiting, seeking to settle old debts.""They all apologized and said they had tried to see my father while he was alive but his office was always too crowded and they were embarrassed,"" Mr. Saeed said.Five times such men arrived, hat in hand, not just to pay their respects to the son and family, but also to say they wanted to pay for books they had shoplifted as children. Mr. Saeed said his father, Saeed Jan Qureshi, who died of heart failure in September, would have been amused: He had always regarded book theft by children as an investment in a future where people still read, and thus become his customers.The man himself became an oracle to those looking for advice on books, taking time to establish a personal connection and to urge favorites on visitors. (That is another thing his son has inherited: He asked a visitor if he had read ""Fallen Leaves,"" the last book by the prolific American historian Will Durant, published in 2014, more than 30 years after his death.)That approach helped Mr. Qureshi make an extraordinary future for Saeed Book Bank, particularly in an era when online sales have been driving independent bookstores out of business, and in a region where unfettered book piracy adds to retailers' travails.With his passion for books, Mr. Qureshi built one of the biggest bookstores in the world -- mostly selling books in English, in a country where that is a second language for most people.Saeed Book Bank has 42,000 square feet of usually busy floor space over three stories, displays 200,000 titles, and stocks more than four million books in its five warehouses -- all, Ahmad Saeed said, ""by the grace of the almighty.""(His visitor had not read ""Fallen Leaves,"" so Mr. Saeed sent one of his 92 employees to fetch a copy. ""It is so good, you must read this book."" Another visitor to the office, an aged doctor named S.H. Naqvi, agreed, having himself read it at their insistence: ""It will touch your heart,"" he said.)Saeed Jan Qureshi came from a family that worked for a feudal landlord named Mir Banda Ali. His estates in southern Sindh Province were so vast that five railway stops reputedly lay within his property lines. His library was similarly scaled, and as a 9-year-old, Saeed was put to work dusting the shelves. One day Mr. Ali found him reading instead of working, and told the boy to get back to work immediately -- but added that he could take a book home every night, so long as he returned it in mint condition.Saeed never got past high school but he was exceedingly well-read, and after school he found a job as a book salesman for a company that sent him to its Peshawar branch. Later, in the 1950s, he opened his own bookshop in Peshawar.During the Cold War years that followed, Pakistan was an outpost in the American rivalry with the Soviet Union, and Peshawar became an important military base, and later a vital C.I.A. base of operations, particularly during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Say what you will about the spooks, they were readers, and Mr. Qureshi built his business around catering to their literary tastes.(Speaking of Afghanistan, Mr. Saeed said: ""Have you read 'The Spinner's Tale,' by Omar Shahid Hamid? No?"" He seemed mildly shocked. Moments later a Pan Macmillan paperback copy of the novel materialized. ""I am sorry, we've sold out of 'Fallen Leaves' -- it's so hard to keep in stock -- but read this,"" Ahmad said. ""A lot of it is set in Afghanistan."")Later the rise of terrorism and fundamentalist Islam made Peshawar, capital of the wild frontier lands of Pakistan, a dangerous place for a bookseller -- especially one who insisted on carrying magazines like Cosmopolitan and Heavy Metal, books by Karen Armstrong on Islam, and even the scientist Richard Dawkins's atheist treatise, ""The God Delusion."" (""You just wouldn't believe how that sells,"" Mr. Saeed said. ""We buy a thousand copies from Random House every year, year after year."")On the other hand, he said, another best-seller is ""The Message of the Qur'an,"" an English translation of the holy book by Muhammad Asad, a European Jewish scholar and diplomat who converted to Islam.Forced to close shop in Peshawar, Mr. Qureshi focused his efforts in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, a place heavily insulated from the country's more extremist elements. Hard times followed as even Islamabad became a ""no families"" posting for diplomats and aid workers, but by then the bookstore was so big that its sheer breadth kept it viable, as plenty of Pakistanis read books in English.""Other Pakistani booksellers laughed at us that we never carried pirated books,"" Mr. Saeed said. ""But only best-sellers get pirated, and we carry everything.""The result is a bookstore of impressive scope, quirky and catholic. ""Islamic Fashion,"" a glossy coffee table book and a best-seller, vies for shelf space with ""Queer Studies.""A thick condolence book for Mr. Qureshi, the third so far, sits on a counter, which sags under the weight of a couple hundred miniature books as well. A few rows away, an entire shelf is given over to Noam Chomsky, 26 titles in all, which may well be more than any bookstore in the world displays for the radical linguist and philosopher.""Honestly, Chomsky sells here,"" Mr. Saeed said.As the eldest son, Mr. Saeed was always destined to take over the business when his father passed away, and to learn the trade he traveled with his father to international book fairs; annually to Frankfurt, thrice yearly to London, twice yearly to Delhi.But not to the United States, the Saeed Book Bank's biggest source of books.""We spend $500,000 annually in America, and I can't get a visa,"" Mr. Saeed said. ""The consular officer said, 'Why can't you just order by email and fax?' They just don't understand about books. You have to go to the warehouses, and see them and feel them -- that's how you buy books.""(""Fallen Leaves"" again: ""When my father was sick, he said, 'Read this book, and you will calm down,""' Mr. Saeed said. ""He was right."" Dr. Naqvi could quote lines from it. ""What if it is for life's sake that we must die?"" Otherwise, ""youth would find no room on the earth."")Mr. Qureshi made sure his children had the education he did not. Ahmad has a master's degree in business administration, with ambitious plans to computerize the store's inventory and build up what is now a clunky and unsophisticated online business. Nonetheless, it sells $1,000 worth of books a day online in a place where credit cards are still a novelty.For his father, books were more than just a business, Mr. Saeed said. One of the penitent former book thieves who dropped in was Suleman Khan, the vice chancellor of Iqra University, in Islamabad.""He came to say that when he was a child, 6 years old or so, he stole an Archie comic book and my father saw him,"" Mr. Saeed said. ""He said he was afraid he was going to get slapped, but my father said: 'This is good that you like books. So every day you can take a book but keep it in mint condition and return it when you're done so I can still sell it.""'And then the vice chancellor said, ""Everything that I am now, I owe to your father.""(Dr. Naqvi, who is getting on in years, had seemed to doze off for a moment but awoke when he heard that story. ""'Fallen Leaves,""' he sighed. ""You have to read that book. Everything is in there."")Photograph Saeed Book Bank in Islamabad, Pakistan, has Become an Institution There, Despite Facing Stiff Online Competition and Existing in a Region Rife with Book Piracy.; Ahmad Saeed, Left, Looking Over a Collection of New Arrivals Before They Reach Store Shelves.

"The Internet Tastes Better With Cat Hair:   [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDED. WHILE it's not true that 15 percent of all Internet traffic is cat-related, as the Friskies cat food company asserted in 2013, it does make a convincing urban legend.""For some reason, cats took off, and then it's this avalanche that just sort of keeps piling up,"" said Jason Eppink, the curator of ""How Cats Took Over the Internet,"" an exhibition that opens on Friday at the Museum of the Moving Image. ""People on the web are more likely to post a cat than another animal, because it sort of perpetuates itself. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.""The exhibition -- which may well be the first mainstream museum installation entirely dedicated to cats online -- is made up mostly of images, videos and GIFs of cats and is meant to be a cultural deconstruction of their enduring popularity. The show takes a high-minded look at anthropomorphism and what it calls the ""aesthetics of cuteness"" as well as a low-brow wallow through cheesy trends -- like the LOLcats who demand cheezburger -- and bad puns, like Caturday, a fad that had people posting cat pictures on Saturdays.The cornerstone of the exhibition is a 20-year timeline that traces the history of cats on the Internet to 1995, when a news group -- a bulletin-board-type online community that was an early form of social media -- coalesced around the members' love of cats. From this began Meowchat, where people swapped role-playing messages posing as their cats, talking in a sort of baby talk. (Predictably, some members of the news group grew revolted and left to form a splinter message board.)The part of the timeline dealing with the present serves as a nostalgia gallery for anyone who has squandered the workday on popular share-mails: There is Cliché Kitty, a frolicking kitten in a field of dandelions that is blithely unaware it is being menaced from behind; Grumpy Cat (of course); and Nyan cat, a cartoon image of a cat named for the Japanese term for ""meow."" There are homages to cat shaming, in which people photograph their cats next to confessional signs (""I puked on my owner's chair""); cat breading, where cat owners place actual slices of bread around their hapless pet's face and take a picture; and -- in a particularly up-to-the-moment cultural reference -- Trump Your Cat, which involves brushing your cat and forming the loose fur into a Donald Trump-style toupee on the cat's head.""Even as far back as 1991, 1995, there was a whole community of cat lovers who found each other online and was doing creative things,"" said Mr. Eppink, 31, who does not own a cat and whose title at the museum is associate curator of digital media. ""They were being performative and creative.""The exhibition reaches back even further, showing what cat video historians believe was the very first example of the genre: a Kinetoscope shot by Thomas Edison in 1894, of two cats in a boxing ring sparring with gloves.Carl Goodman, the museum's executive director, said that the Museum of the Moving Image -- in an arts district next to Kaufman Astoria Studios, a film production hub -- tends to be known for whatever exhibition it is currently showing, which right now is one about the TV show ""Mad Men."" Every year the museum hosts an independent video game festival called IndieCade; it is now installing a permanent gallery dedicated to Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets.Mr. Goodman, who said that he ""happened to own"" a Labradoodle, said he was enthusiastic about the Internet cat exhibition from the start, but acknowledged that there would be doubters. ""Some people are going to sneer at this -- they tend to trivialize cats,"" he said. ""By putting this in a museum, we're not saying that it's art, we're not saying that it's not art -- we're saying it's culturally significant.""The museum is not the first to present cat videos in this context. Since 2012, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis has hosted an annual Internet Cat Video Festival, a sort of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" for cat lovers, a traveling reel of videos that is screened around the country and updated each year. The Walker has lent a hand here, too: One area of the Astoria exhibition, which occupies a pleasant, open space on the second floor of the white-walled and starkly modern museum, is a screening room with bench seating where a half-hour reel of cat videos will be shown in a continuous loop. The reel was compiled by Will Braden, curator of the cat video festival for the Walker. Hard-core cat people will recognize him as the creator of Henri, le Chat Noir, a world-weary house cat who thinks existential thoughts in French.In the reel compiled for this exhibition, ""I tried to showcase the differences in videos that all fall under the banner of cat videos,"" Mr. Braden, who is based in Seattle, said in a telephone interview. ""There are music videos, there are very produced videos, and there are accidental camera phone videos that people just happened to be pointing at their cat. I think that's part of what makes cat videos successful, is that they cover a lot of ground.""Henri -- who in reality is a relative's tuxedo cat, Henry -- appears in a Halloween-themed clip Mr. Braden made called ""L'Haunting,"" in which the cat sneers at the holiday-related paraphernalia around him and observes in French (with English subtitles): ""None of these costumes are truly scary. No one ever dresses as crippling self-doubt.""In related events, the Museum of the Moving Image will hold a ""Cat-vant Garde Film Show"" on Oct. 10, showing avant-garde movies like ""Nightcats"" by Stan Brakhage and ""How to Draw a Cat"" by Pola Chapelle. People can adopt cats at the museum that day and on a second date to be announced.Mr. Eppink, the curator, who once told an interviewer that he was fascinated with the history of the word ""O.K.,"" conducted extensive research on the intersection of cats and the Internet (well beyond Google). From the New Zealand researcher Radha O'Meara, he learned why cat videos are perceived as more appealing than dog videos: Because dogs are pack animals that look artlessly into the camera, whereas cats are hunters that don't care if they are being filmed. ""Cats are more mercurial and liminal,"" Mr. Eppink said.He also crunched numbers with editors from Reddit, YouTube, Tumblr, BuzzFeed and Instagram to suss out what percentage of their traffic was cat-related. Surprise: Other than on Tumblr -- where cats are more popular than dogs -- cats and dogs tend to be tagged, posted and electronically doted on in equal amounts, seldom exceeding .3 percent of a site's traffic.""I take a delight in finding depth in seemingly frivolous subjects,"" Mr. Eppink said.",0.0
"4 Catholic Nonprofits Must Allow Workers Access to Birth Control, Judges Say:   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"Four Roman Catholic nonprofits in New York must allow employees access to contraception, a federal appeals court panel ruled on Friday, reversing a decision by a lower court that allowed the organizations to get around a requirement in the Affordable Care Act.Six other circuit courts around the country deciding on similar arguments involving religious groups have come to similar conclusions, the unanimous three-judge panel noted in its decision, which was written by Judge Rosemary S. Pooler for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York. Other cases are still pending.Under the Affordable Care Act, religious nonprofits that object on religious grounds to providing contraception can opt out by completing a one-page form. Then, a third party, either an insurance company or a health insurance administrator, takes over providing and coordinating payments for the employees' contraceptives.The four New York groups -- a Catholic high school in the Bronx and another on Staten Island, as well as two Catholic health care systems -- argued that the opt-out sheet imposed a ""substantial burden"" on their religious freedom. Either they had to offer ""access to products and services they find objectionable,"" as Judge Pooler summarized it, or they faced high fines.Judge Brian M. Cogan of Federal District Court in Brooklyn upheld that argument in 2013, agreeing that the opt-out provision itself violated the employers' religious freedom. Judge Cogan granted an injunction requiring the to employees pay for their contraceptives.However, Judge Pooler wrote that the opt-out form was, in fact, ""a modicum of paperwork"" that ""relieves, rather than imposes, any substantial burden"" on the plaintiffs' religious freedom.""Eligible organizations are provided the opportunity to freely express their religious objection to such coverage as well as to extricate themselves from its provision,"" she wrote. ""At the same time, insured individuals are not deprived of the benefits of contraceptive coverage.""The health care law requires employers to cover contraceptives for female employees.Religious groups, though, can ""opt out of paying for objectionable medical services without denying these services to employees who may or may not share the religious beliefs of their employer,"" Judge Pooler wrote.The four groups are affiliated with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.As an alternative to the opt-out form, which is sent to the federal Labor Department, religious groups may send a letter to the federal Department of Health and Human Services ""detailing their religious objections in their own words,"" and the government would then notify insurance administrators.If an organization is self-insured, as the four groups are, the administrator may get payments for contraceptives directly from the government, leaving the organization out of the process. Even when the administrator contacts employees who want contraceptives, it has to ""make clear that the eligible organization is neither administering nor funding the contraceptive benefits,"" Judge Pooler wrote.""Viewed objectively, completing a form stating that one has a religious objection is not a substantial burden,"" she wrote.Judge Pooler compared the completion of the form to a conscientious objector's alerting the military to his position. ""There must be some method by which the government can be notified of the objection,"" she wrote. ""Otherwise there is no way that the government can know which organizations it needs to accommodate. Here, the government has provided flexible, largely effortless and essentially cost-free options for notification.""Because the contraceptive coverage was provided under federal law, she wrote, the groups' argument that their completion of the form triggered contraception coverage was incorrect.Brigitte Amiri, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed an amicus brief in the case, said: ""It's a huge victory for all the female employees who work at the organizations. The scorecard is really 7-0 in the Courts of Appeals on this issue.""A spokesman for the archdiocese, Joseph Zwilling, said its lawyers were reviewing the decision. They also represent the religious organizations: Catholic Health Care System, Catholic Health Services of Long Island, Cardinal Spellman High School and Monsignor Farrell High School.",0.0
Turkey Table Trouble:   [Style Desk ],,"My brother and his wife are divorcing. My sister-in-law usually holds Thanksgiving, but this year I am, due to their circumstances. My brother said he will ""give up"" the holiday and we should invite his wife and children. (He is seeing another woman and probably wants to spend the day with her. Meanwhile, my sister-in-law has been texting me about his infidelity. Too weird!) I like my sister-in-law, but she's not family. But if I don't invite her, we won't see the kids. I told my brother they should all come, but he was noncommittal. Ideas?BeatriceNo matter how gnarly a knot I presented to my father as a boy, I could count on his working at it until my shoelaces (or kite strings or yo-yos) were free, at last, for me to knot up all over again. Some people are blessed with patience; others, scissors. Let's try my dad's approach on your Thanksgiving tangle. Dealing with the separate strands makes them easier to handle.First, call your brother on his noble abdication of the holiday. (""I'm guessing you want to spend the day with Sharon. Can't you see her on Black Friday, instead?"") But he may not be keen on sharing close quarters with his estranged wife, depending on how conscious their uncoupling is. Respect his wishes if he says he can't socialize with her. A screaming match is not a tasty side dish.Now, for your sister-in-law: No one (I know) wants to hear about our brother's infidelity, via text, from their estranged spouse. In your kindest voice, say: ""You know I love you. But I am not the person for you to confide in about my brother."" With the results of these separate conversations under your belt -- together with your impulse to be kind to the children -- decide whom you want to invite for Thanksgiving. It's your holiday, too.The Missing MomsFor several years, two gay couples and I (the host and lone singleton) have celebrated Thanksgiving with three of the crowd's widowed mothers. (The other two moms live at considerable distance.) Last year, one of the mothers died; and this year, another one passed away. So our party will be five men, one mother and strong memories of the two who passed. Any suggestions for keeping the party light and avoiding the feel of a memorial service?Joe, New York""There ought to be a hall of fame for mamas,"" as Glen Campbell and Steve Wariner sang pretty convincingly in the late '80s. But there isn't. So, while I understand your desire to avoid a maudlin turkey day, a party constituted consistently of the same small crew of mothers and sons will necessarily need a moment to mark the passing.Try going in the opposite direction from the one you're considering. Don't avoid the deaths. Start the party with a toast to the two mothers who have died. Their sons will appreciate it. And you will have noted the admirable ""through thick and thin"" nature of your Thanksgiving tradition. Also, by acknowledging the elephant in the room, you will create an opening for moving beyond it, to cheerier subjects, too.>The Rejected HostessLast month, I invited a single friend (without family) to join our small gathering for Thanksgiving. She accepted; then 10 days later, she told me she had just received an invitation from close friends with whom she had celebrated before and would be joining them, instead. I understand her preference to be with old friends, but I still feel rejected. Am I being hypersensitive, or could she have handled this better?Susan, Alameda, Calif.I am sorry that kindness landed you with hurt feelings. (And I don't think you are being hypersensitive, especially if you think of this woman as a friend and not merely as a ""holiday orphan."") She had a few options: Stick with the first invitation she accepted; deploy a white lie to spring herself from your dinner; or try a heart-to-heart with you, explaining her predicament. She went with option three and failed.Now, it's your turn: Tell her that her switch-up hurt your feelings. A sincere apology might make you feel better. Or leave things alone, if you prefer. But congratulate yourself on opening your home to someone without a place to go. That makes you a nice person, in my book.Boyfriend's a BoorTwo years ago, our daughter brought home her boyfriend for the holiday. He slept until 3 p.m. every day and stayed up all night drinking in their bedroom. We found this rude. She wants to bring him again this year, and we are dreading a repeat performance. What should we do?AnonymousTell your daughter you can't wait to see them. (It doesn't sound as if this beau is going anywhere.) Then add: ""But Jim's all-night drinking and all-day sleeping seemed antisocial to us. Let's agree that everyone's up by 11, this year, in time for turkey hash."" Some houseguests need boundaries spelled out.Defending the BossThe owner of the company I work for got into hot water for doing something insensitive. Social media had a field day with it. The story has mostly run its course, but I still find myself having to defend the owner (over a decision I had nothing to do with) or acquiesce to people I suspect of merely jumping on a bandwagon out of schadenfreude. How to quash these conversations?J.L., New YorkIn the immortal words sung by Whitney Houston, ""It's not right, but it's O.K."" Social media has shined a bright light on social justice issues. (Think of the tragic encounters between African-Americans and law enforcement.) Just last weekend, Facebook allowed Parisians to ""check in safe"" amid heartbreaking calamity. And social media hooked me up with my best pal from third grade. I am not going to dump on social media.Still, there is nothing (many) social media users love like piling on, especially when the whiff of sanctimony is in the air. Your boss was probably caught saying something stupid or offensive. Why would her or his defense be on you? Say: ""I only know what I saw on Twitter. Nothing juicy to add, I'm afraid."" Tamp down the embers of yesterday's controversy by being dull.Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion, and Vows), and Instagram.For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes­.com or SocialQ on Facebook.

'Last Days in Vietnam':   [The Arts/Cultural Desk ],,"[Video: Watch on YouTube.]As the war in Vietnam recedes deeper into history, replaced in the American consciousness by more recent conflicts in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, its lessons also seem to fade. That amnesia is what the film director and producer Rory Kennedy is trying to counteract in ""Last Days in Vietnam,"" one of five nominees for the Oscar for best feature-length documentary.True to its title, ""Last Days in Vietnam"" focuses on America's withdrawal from Saigon in April 1975, as the allied government of South Vietnam was collapsing in the face of a North Vietnamese offensive. Even as the United States ambassador, Graham Martin, seems slow to recognize the gravity of the situation, embassy staff members are shown working frantically to evacuate as many of their South Vietnamese counterparts as possible, sometimes ignoring or defying orders from Washington to do so.""I think there are moments of real inspiration in the film, where in that larger context there were people on the front lines, Americans and South Vietnamese alike, who in the face of those obstacles did the right thing,"" Ms. Kennedy, 46, said. ""I don't think the film makes you proud of American policy at that time. But it might make audience members proud of these Americans.""""Last Days in Vietnam,"" commissioned by PBS's ""American Experience"" series and scheduled to be broadcast this spring, is something of a reporting feat. Ms. Kennedy tracked down undeveloped and unseen film footage from important moments in the collapse and evacuation, and interviewed Americans and South Vietnamese involved in the effort, including some Vietnamese left behind, whom the new Communist government sent to re-education camps. She also managed to persuade the former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger to offer his account of what happened.Ms. Kennedy, the youngest child of Robert F. Kennedy, has been directing and producing documentaries, mostly with political or social themes, since the 1990s. In a telephone interview from Los Angeles last month, she discussed the historical context of her film and the tools available to her as a documentary filmmaker. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation:Q.For anyone who lived through this episode, it was depressing to revisit it. Was that your objective?A.The big context of this story is very depressing, what we did and how we went about it was certainly a dark moment in our nation's history. But I think the primary objective in making this film was that we are nearing the 40th anniversary, which is coming this April, and so it was a good time to look back at these events. It was two years ago that I was developing this film, and we were at the brink of withdrawing from Iraq and Afghanistan. So I thought that looking specifically at the end of Vietnam and what happened, there could be some lessons we could learn as a country about the art of getting out of a war that we haven't clearly won.Q.Was there also a didactic element involved? Your mention of the 40th anniversary reminds me there is a whole cohort of Americans who weren't alive at that time. Is there a need to remind them?A.I've gone to campuses with the film, and surprisingly many people today aren't studying Vietnam at all. So there is a generation of Americans who really have no knowledge of this war.Having made this film, I learned some lessons, and one of them is that by the time April 1975 came around, there were very few good options available to the U.S. government. What that says to me is that the time when we have the most strategic positioning is before we enter these wars, and that we need to ask the questions the film asks: What are our responsibilities to the people who are in these countries when we leave? What is our exit strategy? These are fundamental and important questions, and I hope my film is a reminder of the human cost of war.Q.PBS suggested the idea for ""Last Days in Vietnam"" to you. Did you hesitate at all about taking on the project?A.I was pretty much in instantly. I think there was a 72-hour period where I did the initial research and came to understand the events, that there was so much richness there. Honestly, for me as a filmmaker, I've probably made 35 films in my career, and this one was the one that was most dramatic and narratively contained. Everything else aside, it's a really good story, right? [Laughs] It's got a beginning, middle and end, it's got climactic moments, it builds in a dramatic way and feels like a Hollywood thriller. In all my other films, I've had to build them in the editing room. But this was inherently dramatic.Q.How do you see the evolution of documentary films over the time you've been working? What changes stand out most to you?A.You see a lot of crossover nowadays, in both directions. You see more Hollywood people, filmmakers and actors and executives on the dramatic feature side, who are jumping into the doc business. And I think we as the documentary community are watching Hollywood films and looking at new techniques and employing them. We understand that we need audiences to watch our films, and we want them to be both entertained and engaged, as well as be transported to understand other lives and perspectives. So I think there really is a sense you can do both, and that documentaries don't have to be spinach.Q.Do you personally feel that you now have more freedom, more arrows in your quiver, than you did say 10 years ago?A.I do. I go to Hollywood films and think about how to apply some of what I'm seeing to my documentaries. There are story points in the film that reminded me of ""Argo,"" like the files of people that needed to be disposed of at the last minute, or the money being burned. I debated whether to include those, because they made the film longer and were easy to just take out. But I thought those would speak to people because they had seen ""Argo"" and there were similar moments there.Q.You were shortlisted once before for the Oscar in this category, but this is your first nomination. What are your impressions of the process?A.I think the goal with all of these films is to get them to reach as large an audience as possible, and the Oscars and having a nominated film can enhance that. So we are all invested in that process. And I think it's also a community that is really supportive of each other and appreciates how hard it is to make a documentary and get distribution. [Laughs] So it's a nice affirming thing.You know there are many, many wonderful lives that films have, and I have made dozens that haven't been nominated. It's not the end of the world, but this is very nice icing on the cake.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",0.0

The Longevity Feast:   [Style Desk ],,"Dan Buettner and I were off to a good start. He approved of coffee.""It's one of the biggest sources of antioxidants in the American diet,"" he said with chipper confidence, folding up his black Brompton bike.As we walked through Greenwich Village, looking for a decent shot of joe to fuel an afternoon of shopping and cooking and talking about the enigma of longevity, he pointed out that the men and women of Icaria, a Greek island in the middle of the Aegean Sea, regularly slurp down two or three muddy cups a day.This came as delightful news to me. Icaria has a key role in Mr. Buettner's latest book, ""The Blue Zones Solution,"" which takes a deep dive into five places around the world where people have a beguiling habit of forgetting to die. In Icaria they stand a decent chance of living to see 100. Without coffee, I don't see much point in making it to 50.The purpose of our rendezvous was to see whether the insights of a longevity specialist like Mr. Buettner could be applied to the life of a food-obsessed writer in New York, a man whose occupational hazards happen to include chicken wings, cheeseburgers, martinis and marathon tasting menus.Covering the world of gastronomy and mixology during the era of David Chang (career-defining dish: those Momofuku pork-belly buns) and April Bloomfield (career-defining dish: the lamb burger at the Breslin Bar and Dining Room) does not exactly feel like an enterprise that's adding extra years to my life -- or to my liver.And the recent deaths (even if accidental) of men in my exact demographic -- the food writer Joshua Ozersky, the tech entrepreneur Dave Goldberg -- had put me in a mortality-anxious frame of mind.With my own half-century mark eerily visible on the horizon, could Mr. Buettner, who has spent the last 10 years unlocking the mysteries of longevity, offer me a midcourse correction?To that end, he had decided to cook me something of a longevity feast. Visiting from his home in Minnesota and camped out at the townhouse of his friends Andrew Solomon and John Habich in the Village, this trim, tanned, 55-year-old guru of the golden years was geared up to show me that living a long time was not about subsisting on a thin gruel of, well, gruel.After that blast of coffee, which I dutifully diluted with soy milk (as instructed) at O Cafe on Avenue of the Americas, Mr. Buettner and I set forth on our quest at the aptly named LifeThyme market, where signs in the window trumpeted the wonders of wheatgrass. He reassured me, again, by letting me know that penitent hedge clippings had no place in our Blue Zones repast.""People think, 'If I eat more of this, then it's O.K. to eat more burgers or candy,' "" he said. Instead, as he ambled through the market dropping herbs and vegetables into his basket, he insisted that our life-extending banquet would hinge on normal affordable items that almost anyone can pick up at the grocery store. He grabbed fennel and broccoli, celery and carrots, tofu and coconut milk, a bag of frozen berries and a can of chickpeas and a jar of local honey.The five communities spotlighted in ""The Blue Zones Solution"" (published by National Geographic) depend on simple methods of cooking that have evolved over centuries, and Mr. Buettner has developed a matter-of-fact disregard for gastro-trends of all stripes. At LifeThyme, he passed by refrigerated shelves full of vogue-ish juices in hues of green, orange and purple. He shook his head and said, ""Bad!""""The glycemic index on that is as bad as Coke,"" he went on, snatching a bottle of carrot juice to scan the label. ""For eight ounces, there's 14 grams of sugar. People get suckered into thinking, 'Oh, I'm drinking this juice.' Skip the juicing. Eat the fruit. Or eat the vegetable."" (How about a protein shake? ""No,"" he said.)So far, I was feeling pretty good about my chances of making it to 100. I love coffee, I'm not much of a juicer and I've never had a protein shake in my life. Bingo. I figured that pretty soon Mr. Buettner would throw me a dietary curveball (I noticed with vague concern that he was not putting any meat or cheese into his basket), but by this point I was already thinking about how fun it would be to meet my great-grandchildren.I felt even better when he and I started talking about strenuous exercise, which for me falls somewhere between ""root canal"" and ""Justin Bieber concert"" on the personal aversion scale.I like to go for long walks, and ... well, that's about it.""That's when I knew you'd be O.K.,"" Mr. Buettner told me.It turns out that walking is a popular mode of transport in the Blue Zones, too -- particularly on the sun-splattered slopes of Sardinia, Italy, where many of those who make it to 100 are shepherds who devote the bulk of each day to wandering the hills and treating themselves to sips of red wine.""A glass of wine is better than a glass of water with a Mediterranean meal,"" Mr. Buettner told me.Red wine and long walks? If that's all it takes, people, you're looking at Methuselah.O.K., yes, Mr. Buettner moves his muscles a lot more than I do. He likes to go everywhere on that fold-up bike, which he hauls along with him on trips, and sometimes he does yoga and goes in-line skating. But he generally believes that the high-impact exercise mania as practiced in the major cities of the United States winds up doing as much harm as good.""You can't be pounding your joints with marathons and pumping iron,"" he said. ""You'll never see me doing CrossFit.""For that evening's meal, Mr. Buettner planned to cook dishes that would make reference to the quintet of places that he focuses on in ""The Blue Zones Solution"": along with Icaria and Sardinia, they are Okinawa, Japan; the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica; and Loma Linda, Calif., where Seventh-day Adventists have a tendency to outlive their fellow Americans, thanks to a mostly vegetarian diet that is heavy on nuts, beans, oatmeal, 100 percent whole-grain bread and avocados.We walked from the market to the townhouse. And it was here, as Mr. Buettner laid out his cooking ingredients on a table in Mr. Solomon's and Mr. Habich's commodious, state-of-the-art kitchen, that I noticed the first real disconnect between the lives of the Blue Zones sages and the life of a food writer who has enjoyed many a lunch hour scarfing down charcuterie, tapas and pork-belly-topped ramen at the Gotham West Market food court.Where was the butter? Hadn't some nice scientists determined that butter's not so lethal for us, after all? (""My view is that butter, lard and other animal fats are a bit like radiation: a dollop a couple of times a week probably isn't going to hurt you, but we don't know the safe level,"" Mr. Buettner later wrote in an email. ""At any rate, I can send along a paper that largely refutes the whole 'Butter is Back' craze."" No, thanks, I'm good.)Where was the meat? Where was the cheese? (No cheese? And here I thought we'd be friends for another 50 years, Mr. Buettner.)""If you're eating this meal, you're getting all the protein you need,"" he promised me, although it wasn't my protein intake I was worried about.Although it is by no means a stealth vegan manifesto, ""The Blue Zones Solution"" frequently mentions that men and women in these longevity-friendly regions tend to eat meat and fish only sparingly, and they almost never tangle with cow's milk. Mr. Buettner had leapt to the conclusion that I had probably had enough meat and cheese for the week already. He was correct.""We're making up for all your sins tonight,"" he told me. ""What you learn tonight is going to set you on a new path.""The centerpiece of Mr. Buettner's dinner was a dish he had named ""Icarian stew,"" which involved a big pot of black-eyed peas, fennel, onions, garlic, carrots, canned tomatoes and other plant-based delights simmered for hours and then topped with a few glugs of extra-virgin olive oil.""I eat this all the time,"" he said. ""This is how I seduced Kathy Freston, by the way. You ask her. Ask her if Icarian stew has any role in her love for me."" (Mr. Buettner is dating Ms. Freston, the author and advocate of veganism who used to be married to Tom Freston, the former MTV executive.)Raised in Minnesota, Mr. Buettner (pronounced BYOOT-ner) grew up eating ""hotdish and Hamburger Helper -- the usual Midwest crap,"" he said.But in 2005 he wrote an article about the secrets of longevity for National Geographic, and the lightning-striking success of it bestowed upon him both a career mission (starting with his first book, ""The Blue Zones: 9 Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest,"" in 2008) and a new mode of looking at food.He's now a fierce believer in Japanese yams, wild greens and milk thistle. (Throughout ""The Blue Zones Solution,"" he stresses that people in these parts of the world don't just happen to live a long time, they do so with lower rates of the diabetes, heart disease and dementia that seem to afflict much of the junk-food-gobbling globe.)Not long ago he dropped by the Mayo Clinic to meet a doctor for an executive physical. ""I wanted to see if it really paid off,"" Mr. Buettner said. ""And apparently it has. I had the clearest arteries he'd ever seen in a 54-year-old man.""Nevertheless, his findings over the last decade do put him at odds with a controversial range of culinary belief systems.During our afternoon and evening together, he joked that the paleo diet is fine if all you want is the life expectancy of a cave man. The raw food movement? Mr. Buettner brushed it aside and pointed out that in all of the Blue Zones, people cook their meals, sometimes for hours.Fear of a wheat planet? ""Bogus,"" he said. After a couple of hours in the kitchen, Mr. Buettner defied the carb-avoiders and gluten-dodgers of America by dashing over to Union Square on foot to score several loaves of long-fermented, freshly baked sourdough at Breads Bakery.""A true sourdough bread will actually lower the glycemic load of a meal,"" he said. ""But it has to be a real sourdough bread."" (Whew. We were back to the good news.)After a bunch of his friends had gathered in the kitchen (Mr. Buettner referred to them as his New York ""moai,"" which is an Okinawan term for a circle of people who purposefully meet up and look out for one another), he opened a bottle of hard-to-find Sardinian wine and asked them to take their seats. Among them were Mr. Solomon, the author of books like ""Far From the Tree"" and ""The Noonday Demon,"" and Samantha Boardman, a psychiatrist and the wife of the real-estate tycoon Aby J. Rosen.There came a broccoli soup thickened with cashew cream; a simple Japanese paste made from mixing sweet potato and coconut milk; a honey-touched tofu parfait crowned with a berry compote, which Mr. Buettner called ""a little naughty"" because it was sweeter than what you would normally find in a sugar-averse Blue Zone. (Naughty? I guess Mr. Buettner has never had the gochujang Buffalo wings at Seoul Chicken.)Mr. Solomon, although enthusiastic about the longevity feast, appeared to be reading my mind. ""No cheese in Sardinia?"" he asked, a trace of longing in his voice.The meal itself was delicious and nourishing, even if there were moments when my restaurant-conditioned palate was crying out for salt. In a sense, though, the meal was almost beside the point, blurring as it went on into waves of wine and conviviality.Along the way, Mr. Buettner stage-whispered into Mr. Solomon's ear, asking whether our host might be willing to dip into the wine cellar for a special bottle or two. Icaria is known for the longevity of its residents; it's also known for Dionysian all-night parties. I can't say for sure whether I felt longevity coursing through my veins, but there was a fair amount of alcohol.""The secret sauce is the right mix of friends,"" Mr. Buettner said.And as each course arrived (the Icarian stew claiming its rich, flavor-deep place as an obvious showstopper), Mr. Buettner called attention to a last point about the Blue Zones: that in longevity idylls like Icaria, it's not just about what you eat, but how you eat, and how much you and your friends enjoy a meal together.""Dan, do any of the Blue Zones people eat kale salad?"" Mr. Solomon asked.""No,"" Mr. Buettner replied. ""They eat food that they enjoy.""Photograph Dan Buettner, Who Writes Books On Achieving a Long Life, in Part by Eating Healthfully, Shopping at the Lifethyme Market in Greenwich Village.

Activist Hedge Fund Takes a Sizable Stake in Amex,,"ValueAct Capital Management, a prominent activist hedge fund, has taken a significant stake in American Express, which is grappling with a number of recent challenges. Should ValueAct press forward with an activist campaign, American Express would be its latest prominent target. ValueAct has pressed for change at Microsoft, among others, in recent years. Shares of American Express jumped more than 6 percent after Bloomberg News reported that the hedge fund had assembled a position worth about $1 billion. While a significant amount, that holding would still rank the activist investor below American Express's top 10 shareholders. Over the last year, American Express has faced several setbacks, including revenue that has fallen short of analysts' expectations and the loss of a longstanding partnership with Costco. The credit card company was also forced to rearrange its leadership after the death of Edward P. Gilligan, its president and heir apparent, in late May.",0.0
Shire's $30 Billion Offer for Maker of Drugs for Rare Diseases Is Rebuffed:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"LONDON -- The global pursuit of deals by drug makers took a turn on Tuesday as a former target of a mega-merger turned predator.Shire, which last year had sought to sell itself to AbbVie, disclosed that its $30 billion offer for the biopharmaceutical company Baxalta had been rebuffed last month.The rejection of the offer was affirmed later on Tuesday, as Baxalta said that its board and advisers had reviewed Shire's proposal and concluded that it ""significantly undervalues"" the biopharmaceutical company.Still, by going public with the all-stock offer -- which represented a 36 percent premium to Monday's closing price of Baxalta's stock -- Shire, which is based in Dublin, is trying to put pressure on Baxalta to come to the negotiating table by appealing to its shareholders.""Other than a brief meeting on July 10th at which we outlined our proposal and its benefits, your lack of engagement has been surprising,"" Flemming Ornskov, Shire's chief executive, wrote in a letter to his counterpart at Baxalta on Tuesday. ""As a result, you have left us with no choice but to make our proposal known to your shareholders. We believe they deserve an opportunity to consider it.""Baxalta's largest shareholder is the company that it was spun out of, Baxter International, which has a 19.5 percent stake. The spinoff, which was announced in September, was completed on July 1.A merger would create a giant in the treatment of rare diseases. The combined companies would generate $20 billion in product sales by 2020 -- 65 percent of that on drugs focusing on rare diseases, Shire said.""We believe the proposed combination of Shire and Baxalta would be strategically and financially attractive for both of our companies, accelerating our respective growth ambitions and creating the leading global biotech company in rare diseases,"" Mr. Ornskov said in a news release.But Baxalta, which is based in Bannockburn, Ill., disagreed with Shire's stated strategic logic for a merger and emphasized that it had been an independent, publicly traded company only since July 1.""A transaction at this time would be severely disruptive to our young organization and the implementation of a wide variety of critical commercial, R.&D. and operational initiatives, and thus carries with it significant risks for our shareholders,"" Ludwig N. Hantson, the chief executive of Baxalta, wrote in a letter to Mr. Ornskov.If Shire ultimately prevails, it would be the latest acquisition in what has been an active deal-making slate since the $54 billion sale of Shire to AbbVie, another big drug maker based in Illinois, fell through last year. AbbVie walked away from the deal after the Treasury Department announced new rules aimed at reining in inversions, in which a company reincorporates in a country with lower corporate taxes.In January, Shire acquired NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion. Shire also reportedly considered a bid for Salix Pharmaceuticals this year before Valeant Pharmaceuticals International clinched a deal for the company.And Shire agreed on Monday to acquire Foresight Biotherapeutics, a privately held maker of drugs to treat eye conditions, including a drug in late-stage development to treat pink eye, for $300 million.Under the terms of the offer disclosed on Tuesday, Shire said it would pay $45.23 a share for Baxalta, representing a 36 percent premium to its closing price on Monday.Shares of Baxalta rose 12 percent, to $37.10. In London trading, shares of Shire fell more than 5 percent.After the transaction closes, Shire said it would initiate a share buyback program and, within two years, repurchase up to 13 percent of the combined company's outstanding shares.Evercore and Morgan Stanley and the law firms Ropes & Gray and Slaughter and May are advising Shire.Goldman Sachs and Citigroup and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis are advising the board of Baxalta.",0.0
"A Sprawling Manor for $125,000 (Some Disassembly Required):   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"YORKTOWN, N.Y. -- It might just be one of the greatest real estate deals in New York. For $125,000, a roughly 8,000-square-foot Tudor home overlooking lakes and forests in a nature preserve here is up for grabs, the epitome of baronial-bucolic Westchester County living.Built or, more accurately, assembled 101 years ago by Arthur S. Vernay, a noted British antiques dealer and adventurer, much of the house is arguably much older. Brought over in crates from England, it includes a pair of fireplaces from 1357, a 300-pound wrought-iron door and wooden timbers weighing half a ton that adorn the ceiling in the great room.The only catch for today's buyers is that they must pull a Vernay and pull the house down, carting off all or some of it to create their own Frankenstein castle. That, and endure the howls of preservationists who view the house as an integral piece of the land it sits on.Fights over tear-downs are nothing new in the suburbs, but it is no megamansion builder who wants the house gone -- it is the nature preserve that owns it. To fulfill its mission to protect the environment, the preserve says it must sacrifice the house, even if it is piece by period piece.""In a perfect world, we could afford to fix the house and find a use for it, but our responsibility is to a thousand acres of woodlands, not a single house,"" said Kevin Carter, executive director of the preserve, the Teatown Lake Reservation.The reservation lies south of the New Croton Reservoir and the Taconic State Parkway. Nestled squarely in the middle of the protected land is the home, known as the Croft, which Teatown bought for $3 million in 2010, along with the 67 acres that surround it. The land was the real prize.""It was the hole in the doughnut,"" Mr. Carter said last week at his desk inside a former 30-horse stable that was turned into offices and a nature center decades ago.Initially, the hope had been to do a similar conversion of the Croft, and a prospective buyer was even turned down. But the house, despite its provenance, has been altered in some unfortunate ways over the years -- pink shag carpet, asbestos tiles -- and many of its mechanical systems might as well have been imported from Elizabethan England.""There's a reason there are so many fireplaces in here,"" said John DeVito, a former Teatown board president and a contractor who coordinated a four-year review of the property.The multimillion-dollar estimate to renovate the house and bring it up to code proved prohibitive (Teatown's annual budget is only $2 million). Apartments, park offices, a conference center, and even a farm-to-table restaurant were considered. The board also decided it was better to eliminate any environmental, as well as budgetary, impacts from continued occupancy.""It was a wrenching decision,"" Mr. DeVito said.The outcry from local preservationists has been swift and loud, despite the house's relative anonymity in a community brimming with Gilded Age retreats and Colonial-era farmsteads, many already encased in amber or cobwebs.Still, the Croft stands out.The original house, which was expanded in the 1930s, is noteworthy because it is mostly made from imported pieces, according to ""Moving Rooms: The Trade in Architectural Salvages,"" a 2007 book on the popular practice of salvaging (or pillaging) some 700 British buildings for use in America. That sets it apart from the various Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and similar estates, which simply incorporated historical pieces into larger contemporary properties.""Every particle of material used in the structure once formed a part of some ancient English dwelling,"" declared an article in the Aug. 2, 1914, edition of the New York Herald Sunday magazine.Furthermore, preservationists argue that Teatown and the Croft are intrinsically linked, and the principles of conservation and preservation should be working in concert, not conflict.""To tear down the house is to rip out the heart of the estate as it originally was,"" said Jean-François de Lapérouse, the chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission of Yorktown. ""There would be no Teatown without the house.""Not long after completing the Croft, Vernay sold it to Daniel R. Hanna, a Cleveland newspaper and iron magnate, who built the stables. After Mr. Hanna's death, the estate was sold in 1922 for $240,000 to Gerard Swope, the president of General Electric.Six years after Mr. Swope's death in 1957, his heirs donated 194 acres of the property to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, planting the seeds of Teatown. It became a separate entity in 1971 and steadily expanded over the years. Today, there are 15 miles of trails and about 30,000 visitors.The Croft and some of the land remained private, owned for decades by Phil Gilbert Jr., a Manhattan lawyer. After he died in 2008, his heirs sold the property to Teatown.Since Teatown announced plans to dismantle the Croft last month, it has received a number of responses, including two local residents and a woman in Maryland who wants to incorporate the entire house into a new home. Another Westchester County resident covets the oak-paneled Jacobean living room, but Teatown prefers one buyer who will take everything.The preservationists have attracted interest as well, winning support from the Preservation League of New York and the Royal Oak Foundation, the American arm of the National Trust, Britain's chief conservation organization. And the state's Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation sent a letter noting it had already considered the Croft for the Register of Historic Places, though this is more a tax incentive than demolition safeguard.Should a sale occur, Teatown might not abandon the house entirely. One popular proposal was suggested by Timothy Hartung, a local resident and a partner at Ennead Architects, based in Manhattan. He recommended that some elements, perhaps a fireplace or a chimney or some of the gables, be incorporated into a pavilion or other architectural marker.""We don't want to strip the home completely out of our story,"" Mr. Carter said.",0.0
Shakespeare With a New Jersey Accent:   [Review ],,"LENOX, Mass. -- She is a magnificent specimen: the hair big and honey blond, the clothes snug and revealing, the jewelry copious and gold. Meticulously manicured, stalking around in screaming-orange sandals with wedge heels that would maim a weaker woman, the aggrieved Adriana is pure Jersey girl -- the stereotypical variety.She is also a hilariously high-strung delight to behold in Taibi Magar's effervescent staging of ""The Comedy of Errors"" here at Shakespeare & Company, where Kelley Curran unapologetically steals the show with an Adriana who is all defiant posing and tangy Garden State vowels.Yes, yes, Shakespeare's ""The Comedy of Errors"" is the mistaken-identity farce about the two almost indistinguishably named sets of long-lost identical twins, and Adriana isn't among them. Her straying husband, Antipholus of Ephesus (Ian Lassiter), is, though, and can she help it if she loves the creep and just wants him to come home?Operatic in both anger and misery, Adriana thinks nothing of swatting their servant, Dromio of Ephesus (Aaron Bartz), with the foil reflector she uses for sunbathing, and she weeps extravagantly when her steadfast sister, Luciana (Cloteal L. Horne), reports that Antipholus came on to her. But when Luciana confesses that her smitten brother-in-law also praised her beauty -- it was actually her brother-in-law's twin, but she doesn't know that -- Adriana flies into a wounded rage.""Didst speak him fair?"" she yowls. The furious list of insults with which she proceeds to indict him is comical, ridiculous, as self-dramatizing as anything on reality TV -- and sympathetic, too. Beneath all the Jersey girl trappings is a human being, not a Real Housewife, and that lends heft to a production so fizzy that it might otherwise float off into the ether.Punctuated with bursts of pop music (Whitney Houston's ""I Have Nothing"" makes a triumphant appearance) and jubilant dance (choreographed by Jesse Perez), the show moves at an almost manic pace, and the frivolity sometimes seems forced. With Mr. Lassiter doubling as Antipholus of Syracuse, and Mr. Bartz doubling as his servant, Dromio of Syracuse, these upscale boys glide into Ephesus on a yellow tandem bike and forever after reach for their hand sanitizer, repelled by their proximity to the gaudy locals with their Jersey tones.Clad in leather clogs and earthy-chic cotton (the costumes are by Tilly Grimes), Luciana stands apart. When she and Antipholus of Syracuse touch for the first time, the connection between them is electric -- a cause for horror in Luciana, who believes this is her brother-in-law. Happily for us, Ms. Horne does a very funny freakout.Ms. Magar created a problem for herself in single-casting each pair of twins, who must meet in the climactic scene. Her solution is in keeping with the playful spirit of this 90-minute production. But she goes the hoary route in having a man, Douglas Seldin, play Luce, Adriana's maid, an aggressively amorous woman so unattractive that she looks like a large, hairy guy. That's the whole joke, and it's awfully stale.Yet much of the rest, on John McDermott's grassy set, has the loose and friendly feel of a barbecue in the park -- picnic table, busy boombox and all.""The Comedy of Errors"" continues through Aug. 23 in the Tina Packer Playhouse at Shakespeare & Company, Lenox, Mass.; 413-637-3353, shakespeare.org.Photograph The Comedy of Errors: Kelley Curran, Center, in This Production Staged by Taibi Magar at Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, Mass.; Ian Lassiter, Left, and Aaron Bartz in This Mistaken-Identity Farce About Two Similarly Named Sets of Twins.

"Ferguson Sees Change, but Asks if It's Real:   [National Desk ]",,"FERGUSON, Mo. -- Brianna West stepped before the judge as her daughter Morgan, 3, fidgeted beside her. Ms. West had waited weeks to get this case behind her, facing citations that included failure to comply with a police officer. She worried about steep fines, even jail time, on charges she felt were baseless. But the hearing brought relief.A newly appointed judge, Donald McCullin, who like Ms. West is African-American, ordered her to spend 10 hours performing community service. ""He was trying to help me,"" Ms. West said, clearly surprised.It was a starkly different scene from what Ferguson residents faced in this municipal court a year ago before the city was torn by unrest after a white police officer's fatal shooting of a black, unarmed teenager named Michael Brown, before it became a symbol of racial inequities, before a Justice Department investigation concluded that the city unconstitutionally targeted black people for an array of fees and fines largely intended to raise revenue. The department also concluded that the shooting did not warrant criminal charges.Yet if Judge McCullin seems a burst of fresh air for Ferguson, he is only a temporary one. Under Missouri court-retirement rules, he must step down in about eight months when he turns 75. And he is not the only change that may prove fleeting. The city just hired a new police chief and city manager -- also African-Americans -- to replace white officials who had overseen operations that came under scathing criticism in the Justice Department report. But they, too, are interim hires that may end in a matter of months; the new chief is merely on a leave of absence from his department in another state.As it prepares to mark a year since Mr. Brown's death this Sunday, Ferguson, a mostly black community of 21,000 in the patchwork of suburbs north of St. Louis, remains very much a halting work in progress. In recent months, it has taken steps toward repairing racial scars, rebuilding its battered commercial areas and diversifying its once white-dominated government.Yet like so much that was exposed a year ago, Ferguson remains divided -- this time between those who think its progress is real, and those who believe that little beyond the superficial has changed.""This was a real tearing of the fabric,"" said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. ""A lot of pent-up frustration has now really come forward, and that doesn't get well in 12 months. This isn't going to happen overnight. It's not even going to be over 365 nights. It's going to be years.""Nightly protests here have faded in recent months, but law enforcement officials in the region are bracing for a new wave of memorials, concerts, demonstrations, road closings and acts of civil disobedience expected this weekend in commemoration of the anniversary. The family of Mr. Brown has called for peaceful vigils, but the police in the region appear to have prepared for any outcome.Improvements here are undeniable. The local, state and federal authorities point to new programs and new laws enacted since the unrest, including increased funds for job training and college assistance, and legislation lowering the percentage of revenue Missouri cities can make from traffic fines and fees -- described by Gov. Jay Nixon as ""the most sweeping municipal court reform in state history.""Not far from a commercial district scarred by arson, Starbucks plans to open for the first time. The Urban League recently announced a job training center on the site of a convenience store that was looted and burned in the demonstrations that followed Mr. Brown's death.Even the Missouri National Guard, which responded to unrest that grew violent at times last August and November, plans to convert a shuttered building into an armory where it would try to recruit more Guard members from urban areas, federal officials said.Perhaps most significant, city leaders say they have revamped their municipal court system, replacing the longtime judge, and two widely criticized practices: holding people in jail for days on minor offenses when they could not post bonds, and piling on new ""failure to appear"" charges against those who miss court.""Look, I want to be clear in no uncertain terms -- this city has improved,"" said Wesley Bell, a newly elected City Council member who is black and represents the neighborhood where Mr. Brown died.Just below the surface, though, some of the city's biggest problems remain as daunting as ever. The police force, overwhelmingly white when Mr. Brown was killed, remains overwhelmingly white today. Efforts to institute ""community-based"" policing to improve relations with African-American residents appear to be only in the early stages.A sea of ideas considered by a state-appointed Ferguson Commission, including raising the minimum wage and consolidating tiny police departments, remain proposals. Similarly, the Missouri legislature considered more than 20 bills to change law enforcement policies, but only one -- the new cap on traffic ticket revenues -- passed.Perhaps most telling, on the streets near the apartment complexes where Mr. Brown died, people say they feel just as estranged from the police as they did a year ago, just as skeptical of this city's leaders -- black or white.""The mind-set is still that it's normal to have the police stop African-Americans and harass us and shake us down,"" said Phil Gassoway, a Ferguson resident and regular at local demonstrations. ""That's the norm -- still is. There's no change nowhere.""Commercial Districts ScarredNearly all of Ferguson was upended by the months of unrest that followed Mr. Brown's death. But the widely televised looting, fires and violent clashes between the police and protesters left the largest bruises in two of the city's distinct commercial districts, less than two miles apart.Along South Florissant Road, a quaint thoroughfare, frequent confrontations took place between demonstrators and officers in riot gear outside Police Headquarters. After a grand jury chose not to indict the police officer, Darren Wilson, in November, businesses here were looted and vandalized.In the other commercial district, along West Florissant Avenue -- a grittier, wide strip of telephone stores and beauty supply companies close to where Mr. Brown died -- the damage was worse. Officers in large military-style vehicles clashed with large groups of marchers and, in August and November, some businesses were looted or burned to the ground.The recovery, like so much else here, seems uneven.Along West Florissant, several stores have shuttered for good, stray garbage blows across lots filled with broken glass and graffiti covers the wooden boards. Many of the shoppers here come from nearby apartment complexes that house some of the city's poorest residents. Among them: Canfield Green, where Mr. Brown died and where demonstrations boiled over night after night. It has not helped West Florissant that some of the complexes have lost occupants, their residents fleeing to get away from the discord.""Business is absolutely not back,"" said Jay L. Kanzler Jr., a lawyer who represents some shop owners. ""The people who have come back are there only because they put their blood, sweat and tears into it.""Charles Davis, a Ferguson resident who owns Ferguson Burger Bar & More with his wife, Kizzie, opened his doors for the first time the day before Mr. Brown died. The restaurant was never boarded up, or harmed, during the unrest. ""I have a protector that's bigger than me,"" Mr. Davis said.But images of police officers in riot gear linger.""We never owned another restaurant before,"" Mr. Davis said. ""We don't know what to expect other than this. We don't have a history that doesn't include all this.""On the other side of town, along South Florissant Road, fewer traces of the violence remain. Owners here say business is returning, and that a developer has even pitched a project of apartments and stores in the area. Already home to a wine bar and bakery, a cigar bar moved in not long ago. So did a new restaurant, J&C BBQ and Blues.One of the newer storefronts offers a counterpoint to the once-nightly protests outside the police station. The I Love Ferguson store is jammed with merchandise that declares just that: ""I love Ferguson"" shirts, caps and cups, even a children's photo book, ""Painting for Peace in Ferguson"" (for $15.95), of murals painted on boarded-up businesses here last year.Run by a nonprofit that donates its proceeds -- more than $100,000 so far -- to community causes, the group began with simple yard signs promoted by a white former mayor who in April won a spot on the City Council. Some demonstrators and black residents see that message as a rejection of urgent calls for change, but group members see things differently.""We love Ferguson and we are here to do anything we can to keep our Ferguson the way it is,"" said Barbara Tipsword, a volunteer at the store.Ms. Tipsword, 85, was stunned by the angry protests after Mr. Brown's killing, having long thought of Ferguson as a model of integration. Over the last 25 years, Ferguson has shifted from nearly three-quarters white to two-thirds black. In the 1990s, a group formed here called Proud, which stood for People Reaching Out for Unity and Diversity, to promote integration. Some here say they had forgotten all about the group largely because its goals, they thought, had long since been met.""We integrated so well, I had thought,"" Ms. Tipsword said. ""I just didn't know.""She is not particularly sympathetic to the protesters, saying they did not represent the views of Ferguson residents. But she also said she had become more aware of the anger black residents feel toward the police.""I guess the people of Ferguson were complacent,"" she said. ""There was another thing going on for some people.""A New Public FaceAs children gathered for day camp in a room down the hall last month, Andre Anderson, a black police commander from Glendale, Ariz., took to a podium in front of television cameras to be introduced as this city's new, interim police chief.""We cannot do this without you,"" Chief Anderson told the gathered crowd at the community center, emphasizing his commitment to a new kind of inclusive, community-centered policing. He was flanked by Ed Beasley, an African-American who had previously been the city manager in Glendale, and who had been announced as Ferguson's interim city manager a month earlier. Standing nearby, too, were new members of Ferguson's City Council, including two African-Americans who were elected in April, increasing the number of black people on the seven-member Council to three from one.It was a snapshot of an abruptly altered public face for Ferguson.The pressure to swiftly present a new image here is palpable. City leaders say they hope to reach a settlement with the Justice Department over its findings that the city's law enforcement policies were predatory, and that city officials stood by as some employees shared racist emails.But much remains in flux. Efforts to hire more black officers have moved slowly: A year ago at this time, four of the city's approximately 50 officers were black; by this week, five were, including Chief Anderson. For now, Chief Anderson is expected to stay only six months; hiring permanent police chiefs and city managers can take as long as nine months, officials here say. (The city already has a number of vacant jobs, including human resources director and public works director.)And Mayor James Knowles III, 36, who is white and once led a Young Republicans group, not only remains in office but said he was likely to seek a third term for his part-time job, to the dismay of protesters who have demanded his ouster.Tony Rice, a local activist who led the unsuccessful push to recall Mr. Knowles, scoffed at what he viewed as the cynicism of the city's rush to announce interim hires. ""This is almost the most backwards-thinking thing you can think of -- running out and getting a black police chief, a black city manager and a black judge,"" he said.""Every time they've made a move to do something for the community they were pushed and dragged to do it,"" Mr. Rice said. ""Somebody forcing you to change is not change.""Some of the changes are striking. In a municipal court session in the City Council chambers one recent evening, Judge McCullin asked a woman with a cane to return in a few weeks with evidence of her indigence so she could avoid a fine. For a man with a $756 fine, the judge considered time the man had served in jail already and lowered the fee accordingly.Community service -- once a rarity here -- is more the norm under Judge McCullin, a former St. Louis circuit court judge with a puff of white hair who in June was called back from judicial retirement at age 74 to take this post. The fines he levies are, unlike in Ferguson's past, uniform. But he is expected to retire once more in several months.""There are still problems,"" Judge McCullin said in an interview. ""But we have done a lot.""City officials also assert that a culture change is underway in the Police Department. Officers wear body cameras, and beat officers have begun attending neighborhood meetings. With the help of a consultant, the department plans by January to reorganize schedules and beats so that all officers focus on developing closer bonds with the neighborhoods they patrol, Mayor Knowles said.Dominica Fuller, a police officer who has worked in Ferguson for 17 years and was promoted to sergeant in May -- the highest-ranking black woman in department history -- said some officers were trying to interact differently.""You don't know what type of day that person had and why they're speeding home,"" she said. ""They could have a sick child. They could have just gotten fired. You don't know. These are some of the things that some of our officers themselves are starting to do soul-searching about.""But the changes are not universally seen in a positive light. Mayor Knowles said a sharp decline in traffic stops might actually be a sign that the police are afraid to do their job.""We barely pull anybody over anymore,"" he said. Noting that some have suggested that police officers nationally may be behaving less aggressively amid post-Ferguson scrutiny, he said: ""I hate that people call this 'the Ferguson effect.' I've told people they should call it the Eric Holder effect -- when you have the top law enforcement agent in the country come in and scare police from doing their job.""""I have officers that tell me 'I don't know what I'm supposed to do out there,' "" he continued. "" 'I'm scared to pull somebody over because I'm going to be called a racist.' ""Problems With Police LingerIn the mostly African-American neighborhood of low-slung rental apartment complexes near where Mr. Brown died, the mayor's views are not widely shared.People here say the police still treat residents suspiciously, still bark questions, still make arrests for what they consider trivial charges.""They hassle you for no reason at all,"" said Ms. West, the woman who was among those summoned to appear in Ferguson's municipal courtroom one evening last month.City officials say Ms. West was cited for ""failure to comply"" and making a false police report. She was also arrested on an outstanding warrant, according to records, because she owed $77 of an earlier fine for stealing a shower curtain and shower hooks worth about $29.Ms. West, 21, tells a somewhat different story of the recent arrest. She said she was arguing with her boyfriend outside her apartment in May when an officer approached. They told the officer there was nothing wrong, she said. ""He told me if I didn't give him my Social Security number, he was going to lock me up -- and he did,"" she said.In its critique of Ferguson, the Justice Department singled out the ""failure to comply"" ordinance -- which requires people to identify themselves to the police -- as a violation that Ferguson's police officers routinely used to arrest people without proper cause.It is difficult to assess whether Ms. West's arrest was appropriate, as the city declined to provide details or additional records on the two most recent counts against her. She pleaded guilty to those counts, and the judge suspended imposition of a sentence on them, the city said.To many black residents, her case exemplifies a continuing problem that is unlikely to be fixed anytime soon.""The relationship still needs to change between police and the people because that's been the biggest issue in Ferguson for years,"" said Mr. Davis, the restaurant owner. ""It took how long to get it to where it was? So for people to feel that it's going to take a year or less than a year to make some miraculous change, that's just not going to happen.""AuthorAffiliation MONICA DAVEY Mitch Smith contributed reporting from Chicago.",0.0
Chinese Club Team Thrives as National Squad Sputters:   [Sports Desk ],,"A victory by Guangzhou Evergrande in the A.F.C. Champions League, the biggest competition for club soccer in Asia, offered a quick hangover cure for Chinese fans reeling from the continuing struggles of their country's national team.The 1-0 win in the second leg of the finals against the United Arab Emirates' Al Ahli on Saturday gave Guangzhou its second Asian Champions League title in three years. Its 2013 title was the first by a Chinese club.Last week, China's men's national team drew, 0-0, with Hong Kong in a match colored by domestic rivalry and political discontent. The tie made it unlikely that China will advance to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, which provoked angry reactions from Chinese fans and demands that the team's coach, Alain Perrin, be fired.The long-running travails of China's national team are a source of endless distress to Chinese soccer enthusiasts, and Guangzhou's recent success has prompted further head-scratching. Many sports pages have asked what the vastly different fate of the national team says about the state of soccer in China. ""Evergrande's Victory Confirms the Strength of Chinese Players, So Why Is the National Team No Good?"" read the headline on an article on Sunday by the state-run China News Service.While the rules differ by league, the lineups of professional teams are mostly limited by checkbooks, not nationalities. Evergrande has three Brazilian attackers in its starting lineup, including the forward Elkeson, who scored the winning goal on Saturday.Some national teams rely on naturalized players. Against China, Hong Kong fielded players born in Cameroon, England, Ghana, Nigeria and mainland China. China, however, uses only homegrown players. An official in Wuhan has proposed lifting the restrictions that prevent foreign-born players from participating on the national team. But for many fans, such a solution would sidestep the question of why a nation of 1.4 billion, which has managed to dominate global competition in sports like badminton and diving, cannot do the same in soccer.While Evergrande has strong foreign talent, it also has a core of Chinese players, an indication that other problems are at play. Several commentators have argued that China's national team still suffers from unwieldy state-run management. It could benefit from the streamlined, ""capitalist"" model of Evergrande, they say, which is owned by a real estate company and the e-commerce giant Alibaba and this month became the first listed club in Asia.""Evergrande's ability to succeed confirms that if the government gets out of Chinese soccer and gives it over to the market and society, there will be quick results,"" the sports commentator Huang Jianxiang wrote. ""They don't only rely on money, but also the most professional skill levels and methods to improve their game.""President Xi Jinping of China has made no secret of his love for soccer. On a trip to England in October, he visited Manchester City's training ground and had a photo taken with the team's Argentine star, Sergio Agüero, and Prime Minister David Cameron. In March, China announced a plan to overhaul the sport, including increasing youth participation levels and moving the soccer federation from the national sports administration to give it more autonomy.Still, not everyone is confident that Evergrande's success will mean much to anyone besides Evergrande.""The national team is now under Uncle Xi's watch, and the main points of reform have come out, including removing the soccer federation from under the sports administration,"" said a column on the website of the Southern Media Group, based in Guangzhou. ""But what will the national side learn from Evergrande? That's still a question.""Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: Asian Morning newsletter.

"Trump, Saying He Heard Cheers on 9/11, Urges Surveillance of Some Mosques:   [National Desk ]",,"Donald J. Trump said Saturday that he would order surveillance of ""certain mosques"" to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks and claimed to have watched as ""thousands and thousands of people were cheering"" while the World Trade Center towers fell on Sept. 11, 2001.In a rally at the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex in Birmingham, Ala., Mr. Trump, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, dismissed accounts of his apparent support for creating a registry of Muslims in the United States as an effort by the news media to entrap him. He then seemed to clarify that idea on Saturday, saying he wanted a database of refugees entering the country from Syria and adding, to cheers, ""I want surveillance of certain mosques, O.K.?""""We've had it before and we'll have it again,"" he added. Mr. Trump has recently spoken of the New York Police Department's use of informants in mosques after the Sept. 11 attacks.It is unclear whether a database of Syrian refugees would be markedly different from the records already being kept in screening by federal agencies. But Mr. Trump, the leading Republican candidate in some polls, has been perhaps the most strident of all the contenders on the issue of whether to accept refugees after the Paris attacks, raising the possibility that some extremists could slip in among them and telling the crowd Saturday that should he win the presidency, the refugees are ""going back, we can't have them.""Earlier this year, Mr. Trump said that accepting a limited number of refugees from Syria was a humanitarian decision.Perhaps the most striking comment of the day was his recounting of the Sept. 11 attacks as he talked about the security landscape since the Paris massacre:""Hey, I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering. So something's going on. We've got to find out what it is.""It was not clear what Mr. Trump was referring to. There were cheers of support in some Middle Eastern countries that day, which were broadcast on television. But a persistent Internet rumor of Muslims celebrating in Paterson, N.J., was discounted by police officials at the time. A search of news accounts from that period shows no reports of mass cheering in Jersey City.Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the response of Muslim-Americans on Sept. 11 was disgust.""I know because I wrote it,"" he said of the council's reaction, adding that if Mr. Trump had evidence of cheering, he should present it.Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, would not elaborate on his comments; his aides have repeatedly declined to make him available to address the controversies over some of his statements. Ms. Hicks said only that Mr. Trump had drawn an ""unprecedented"" crowd of 10,000 in Birmingham, adding, ""Mr. Trump's speech was great and unbelievably well received.""Since the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris by Islamic extremists, which killed 130 people, the national mood has turned against admitting refugees from Syria, where the Islamic State has taken control of certain areas, a poll by Bloomberg Politics showed last week. And Mr. Trump has been riding a wave of anger and mistrust of government and politicians since he entered the race in June.Mr. Trump's calls for surveillance came after he said earlier in the week that he supported closing some mosques. He has not been alone in making such calls; a top donor to Hillary Rodham Clinton also urged such surveillance in the wake of the Paris attacks. The donor, Haim Saban, later said he had misspoken.The rest of Saturday's speech was a classic Trump performance, a crowd-pleasing stream of boasts, humor and mockery. Referring to George E. Pataki, the former New York governor who has been lagging badly in polls and was one of several opponents to seek airtime from NBC after Mr. Trump hosted the network's ""Saturday Night Live,"" he said: ""They could give him 12 'Saturday Night Lives,' an hour and a half a night -- not going to have any impact.""At one point during the rally, a protester whom Mr. Trump called to have ejected -- ""Get him the hell out of here,"" he ordered security guards -- was punched and kicked by some attendees, CNN reported.The protester, who wore a shirt saying ""Black Lives Matter"" and refused to leave the rally, was hit by roughly a half-dozen attendees, CNN said. The police told the network that the man had not required medical attention.Ms. Hicks did not respond to an email asking about the removal of the protester.Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.",0.0
"Elsinore, Like Hamlet, Comes Back to Life:   [Travel Desk ]",,"One afternoon last fall, I walked along the North Sea coast in search of a ghost.Admittedly, the bucolic spot felt incongruously cheerful for a paranormal encounter. A low sun splayed its rays over the blue water and the majestic red brick walls of the Renaissance castle next to me. Couples with ice cream strolled around the embankment and sea gulls floated above.No phantoms materialized. I was probably several centuries too late.For it was there, along the ramparts of Kronborg Castle, that Hamlet, prince of Denmark, encountered the ghost of his murdered father, setting in motion the revenge story that propels what is perhaps the most famous literary work in the English language.A devotee of ""Hamlet,"" I had taken the 45-minute train ride up the coast from Copenhagen to the town of Elsinore (called Helsingor in Denmark) to immerse myself in the Renaissance-era ""Elsinore"" Castle -- as Shakespeare called it -- and stroll among the town's centuries-old edifices.But I was also keen to witness Elsinore's recent renaissance. Though the town enjoyed centuries as a prosperous royal outpost (thanks mainly to taxes levied on foreign trade ships passing through the adjacent sound that separates Denmark from Sweden), its fortunes ebbed in the 1980s with the collapse of its shipbuilding industry. The docklands wasted away. The town's income became dependent on Swedish day-trippers, who would ferry over to buy cheap booze.The last five years, however, have seen an Elsinore resurgence. Following a major municipal effort, the town now has cutting-edge cultural venues, public artworks and cultural festivals to augment its time-honored appeal.From the train station, I threaded my way past churches with green copper spires and gabled, half-timbered houses in fanciful colors -- peach, mustard, sage -- toward the newest attraction, the M/S Maritime Museum of Denmark.Everywhere, the town flaunted its nautical past. Model ships and sailor hats peeked out from boutique windows. On a wall, a mural depicted a cartoonish vision of the harbor, replete with three-masted ships, buccaneers, sailors, fishmongers and spyglass-toting explorers.Things took a turn for the strange along the docks, where a giant fish had been assembled from colorful plastic flotsam and jetsam, like watering cans, dish racks, garden tools and children's toys. Nearby, a silvery boy sat on a silvery rock and stared forlornly out to sea. A male counterpart to the famous Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen, the highly polished stainless-steel statue of Han (""Him"" in Danish) was unveiled in 2012 by Elmgreen and Dragset, a contemporary art pair known for their sometimes provocative public art installations around the world.A descending gangplank-like walkway brought me into the museum, which traces the seafaring history of the Danes, from the Vikings to the Maersk global shipping empire. Opened in 2013, the subterranean space is built into the U-shaped perimeter of a disused dry dock where large ships were once serviced. The design comes courtesy of the Bjarke Ingels Group (a.k.a. BIG), an envelope-pushing young Danish architectural firm that has built an impressive international portfolio and racked up abundant awards.The result is an enveloping sensory experience, part nautical fun house and part time capsule. Ambling along uneven floors (which mimic being at sea) I was subsumed in cinematic music, colored lights, projected films and noises of boat horns and sea gulls. Display cases resembling old portholes and stacked chests revealed the accouterments of old-time shipboard journeys, from ""hardtack"" sailor biscuits to sextants and sundials.The interactive exhibits revealed something else: my unfitness for maritime life. In an ersatz old-world tattoo parlor, I stenciled the word Mor (Mother) on my forearm with a buzzing pen meant to mimic a needle. The shaky, amateurish result would have left any mother ashamed. In a soaring hall dedicated to contemporary global shipping, equipped with computer terminals and a huge projected map of seaborne transport lanes, my attempts to route a container ship from Australia to Bangladesh resulted in a half-million-dollar loss for my ""company.""Exposed as a landlubber, I consoled myself with fish and chips in the atrium-like restaurant of the Culture Yard next door. Formerly part of the town shipyard, the industrial building has been fully overhauled and outfitted with a jagged glass facade suggesting transparent origami. Today the building houses auditoriums, exhibition areas, a multimedia library and other spaces to host an annual roster of concerts, theater and cinema.That evening's entertainment was provided by bands participating in the fourth edition of the Knejpe Festival, a two-night gala held in Elsinore's numerous nautical-themed bars and old-world taverns. Valorizing sea shanties and world music -- Greek blues, Cuban folk, Afrobeat -- the event pays homage to Elsinore's past as an international port. (Another new event, the multimedia Click Festival, looks instead to the future, exploring ""the field between art, science and technology."")""We thought it would be a great way to tell the story of Elsinore as a maritime city,"" said Mikael Fock, the Knejpe Festival organizer, whom I chanced upon while waiting to enter a subterranean bar called Holger Danske. Throngs of revelers ambled unsteadily through the streets as musicians lugged instruments into various venues. ""There are at least 13 traditional bars left in Elsinore,"" Mr. Fock said.Within Holger Danske, a stony cavern, a gray-haired man and woman called Duo Visti worked a banjo and accordion, strumming and squeezing out minor-key Danish drinking songs while the boisterous crowds swallowed local Wiibroe lager.Down the street, a band called Klepti Klepti summoned rollicking Balkan Gypsy music that shook the walls of Hald An, a smoky tavern decorated with a faded seascape mural. Next up was My Bubba, three young Scandinavian women -- one Dane, one Swede, one Icelander -- in vintage-store dresses who merged their voices in high harmony while strumming and drumming jangly ditties.""Hundreds of years ago there were bars everywhere"" in Elsinore, said Kirsten Dalsgaard, a self-described regular of Kobenhavneren tavern, a cottage-like warren of small rooms decorated with beer steins and paintings. In a corner, Bolvaerket (wharf, in Danish), two middle-aged guys on guitar and bass, cranked out good-time rock. With the Knejpe Festival, she added, ""We are trying to relive it."">Eventually, all paths lead to the iconic Kronborg Castle, a sober, four-sided fortress bedecked with ornate spires and scrolled architectural flourishes, a curious marriage of Lutheran restraint and Renaissance pomp.An actor in period costume led my tour group through the castle rooms as he alternately narrated, re-enacted and provided background to ""Hamlet."" Assuming the role of Horatio, the prince's confidant, he shepherded us along the ramparts, into the cellars and through various stately rooms -- the royal chambers, the palace chapel, the immense ballroom -- while bringing the play's celebrated scenes to life.Afterward I chatted with the actor-guide, William Jansen, alongside the castle courtyard, where Elsinore holds its most famous festival every August. (This year's edition runs Aug. 1 to 9) A mix of performances, films and concerts, ""Shakespeare at Hamlet's Castle"" has drawn some of the modern era's most celebrated actors to play the title role. Laurence Olivier, Derek Jacobi, Richard Burton, Kenneth Branagh and Jude Law are among the many greats who have held Yorick's skull on that very spot.Next year, Mr. Jensen said, promises especially abundant rewards for the Shakespeare faithful. As the 400th anniversary of the playwright's death and the 200th year since ""Hamlet"" was first performed at Kronborg Castle -- by a group of soldiers -- the town is gearing up for a particularly extravagant and extensive homage.""It's going to be a grand occasion"" Mr. Jansen said. Then he strutted across the cobblestones to welcome another group and delve again into Elsinore's past.IF YOU GOGetting ThereSummer is perhaps the most popular season to visit, though spring and fall are also agreeable. Frequent northbound trains (rejseplanen.dk) from Copenhagen's Central Station make the roughly 45-minute journey to Elsinore. A one-way ticket is 108 Danish kroner (about $16 at 6.6 kroner to the dollar).Where to EatClose to the train station, Madam Sprunck is a 37-room hotel (Bramstrade 5) and the town's best restaurant. The timbered, candlelit dining room recently served a hearty fish soup, robust veal nuggets in wine sauce and apple mouse with apple-chile sorbet. A three-course meal for two, without drinks, is about 750kroner. Double rooms from 995 kroner. madamsprunck.dk.In addition to an exhibition center, library and concert venue, the avant-garde Culture Yard (Allegade 2; 45-49-28-37-70; kuto.dk.) houses a cafe-restaurant (open for breakfast and lunch) that serves fish and chips (89 kroner), above, flaeskesteg (roasted pork) sandwiches (95 kroner), Copenhagen microbrews and more.What to SeeInteractive displays on centuries of seafaring fill the M/S Maritime Museum of Denmark (Ny Kronborgvej 1; 45-49-21-06-85; mfs.dk; adults, 110 kroner).Shakespearean history lurks inside Kronborg Castle (45-49-21-30-78; kronborg.dk; admission, 90 kroner), a Unesco World Heritage site that can be visited solo or as part of a group tour, such as ""Introduction to Kronborg Castle"" (free with paid admission) and ""In Hamlet's Footsteps"" (50 kroner in addition to castle admission).FestivalsSpring brings the Click Festival (clickfestival.dk), devoted to multimedia creation in various forms.The long-running Hamletscenen, or Shakespeare Festival, at Hamlet's Castle (hamletscenen.dk), is a multiday August gala of Shakespearean concerts, films and performances, featuring a ""Hamlet"" production.Come fall, the Knejpe Festival (knejpe-festival.dk) of seafaring music fills traditional local bars like Hold-An (Bjergegade 20; 45-40-42-20-59) and Holger Danske (Stengade 68; 45-49-21-14-42; holgerdanske.info).Photograph Revitalized: Kronborg Castle, Top, Was the Setting for ""Hamlet.""

Taliban Pick New Chief and 2 Hard-Line Deputies:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan -- The Taliban leadership announced on Friday that the group's longtime deputy, Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, had been appointed its new supreme leader, and that his two deputies were drawn from its hard-line Haqqani wing, according to messages posted on a website associated with the group.The move greatly elevated the standing of the Haqqani network, which unlike the Taliban's main command is listed by the United States as a terrorist organization. That may also complicate efforts to resume peace talks, which were suspended after confirmation of the death of the Taliban's former leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar.It also threatened a serious split within the Taliban, with Mullah Omar's son, Mullah Yaqoub, at one point walking out of a meeting called to debate the appointment of Mullah Mansour as leader, according to Taliban officials with knowledge of the process. Mullah Yaqoub, who had sought the leadership himself, later publicly criticized the choice.Taliban officials with knowledge of the deliberations by the group's leadership council described several dramatic days of talks this week over choosing a successor, as it became clear to the insurgents that they would no longer be able to keep up the fiction that Mullah Omar was still alive. Notably, the decision was not delayed for deliberation by a larger council of Taliban members, which may hurt its legitimacy in the eyes of some.Initially, the powerful Haqqani network faction was said to be supporting Mullah Yaqoub, as was Mullah Abdul Qayuum Zakir, the Taliban's top military leader. The talks took on urgency as Afghan government officials announced on Wednesday that Mullah Omar died two years ago in a hospital in Pakistan. A day later the Taliban confirmed that he was dead, although without acknowledging when he died.If the new Taliban leadership remains in control, it will pose a dilemma for American policy makers, who have painstakingly tried to draw a sharp distinction between the mainstream Taliban, who were once in government, and the Haqqani faction.Now there would be little to distinguish the Taliban factions, with two powerful Haqqani figures sharing senior roles and the new leader, Mullah Mansour, apparently indebted to them for his position.The new leadership would also be likely to solidify the Pakistani military's strong influence over the Taliban's central command, as the Haqqanis have long enjoyed patronage and protection in Pakistan, and Mullah Mansour is also seen as being close to the Pakistani military and intelligence.The formal announcement of the decision by the leadership council of the Quetta Shura, the Taliban's governing body, was posted on the Taliban website, Shahamat, in English, Pashto and Dari on Friday. The announcement also said that the Taliban's two ""deputy heads"" would be Maulavi Haibatullah Akhunzada, the Taliban's former judiciary chief and a Haqqani network member, and Mullah Sirajuddin Haqqani, the leader of the Haqqani network and the son of its founder, Jalaluddin Haqqani.In an odd coincidence -- if that's what it was -- reports began filtering out on Friday that Jalaluddin Haqqani, who was in his 70s and had long been ill, might have also died in secrecy last year. Reached for comment, a member of the Haqqani network in Pakistan said that Mr. Haqqani had died in December, but the report could not be more widely confirmed.Jalaluddin Haqqani had directly pledged the loyalty of his group to Mullah Omar, but the network retained some autonomy. The group has been responsible for many of the most significant attacks in eastern Afghanistan and in Kabul, especially those targeting Americans.That has not made them opposed to talking peace with the United States. As the faction holding the American prisoner of war Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the Haqqanis were willing to cooperate in swapping him for Taliban prisoners held at Guantánamo Bay -- although American officials insisted that they were not negotiating directly with the Haqqanis but going through other Taliban officials.When the first round of official meetings between Taliban and Afghan government officials took place in Pakistan on July 7, one of the proposed Taliban negotiators was Yahya Haqqani, a brother-in-law of Sirajuddin Haqqani. American officials who were present as observers objected to Yahya, who has a $5 million American bounty for his capture on terrorism charges, and the Haqqanis dropped him from the delegation, according to Mohammad Asim, one of the Afghan delegates.Taliban officials with knowledge of the talks on a successor to Mullah Omar, said that initially, Mullah Zakir, the Taliban military leader, had joined with the Haqqanis in backing Mullah Yaqoub to replace his father as leader.Some Taliban officials saw that as a bid by Mullah Zakir to assume power through the younger Mullah Yaqoub, who is thought to be around 26. After Yaqoub and Zakir walked out to protest the selection of Mullah Mansour, the issue was pressing enough that the Taliban leadership discussed having a jirga, or a grand council meeting, to settle it and head off a schism.Within a day, however, the leadership council had made a deal to give the Haqqanis two posts as deputies, cementing Mullah Mansour as the new leader, the Taliban officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the group's internal politics.They soon persuaded Mullah Zakir to support the choice of Mullah Mansour, and were hopeful of doing the same with Mullah Yaqoub, one of the Taliban officials said. A statement was posted on the Taliban website in Mullah Zakir's name late Friday, saying he had no conflict with Mullah Mansour.""There is no longer any need for a 300-person jirga,"" one of the officials said. ""The family of Mullah Omar pledged its allegiance to Mansour.""However, on Friday, The Associated Press quoted Mullah Yaqoub as saying, ""I am against the decision to select Mullah Akhtar Mansour as leader."" He did not elaborate in the remarks quoted by the news agency.Another Taliban official said that Mullah Omar's brother, Abdul Mannan, had supported Mullah Mansour. ""The leadership council got his support, but Yaqoub was not present,"" the official said. ""Today we have heard that Zakir has been convinced, and if he is convinced, Yaqoub will also be convinced.""The Taliban statement said the new emir had been chosen in a meeting of the leadership council with ""scholars, saints and dignitaries of the Islamic Emirate,"" as it calls its organization. It did not say when the meeting took place, except that it was ""after his passing away,"" a reference to Mullah Omar.Mullah Mansour had officially been the deputy leader of the Taliban for about five years. He had also insisted to many lower-level commanders, despite their doubts, that Mullah Omar was still alive and he was acting on his behalf, raising the potential for hard feelings toward him.Mullah Mansour has supported engaging in peace talks with the Afghan government, but his appointment did not come in time for a scheduled second round of peace talks, which were due to be held in Pakistan on Friday, July 31, but were canceled after Mullah Omar's death became public this week.The Taliban statement said Mullah Mansour ""had been practically administrating the Islamic Emirate"" long before Mullah Omar's death. Another statement posted on the same website recently expressed vague support for peace talks in general, while criticizing foreign interference in them.Maulavi Qalamudin, a member of the Afghan government's High Peace Council and himself a former Taliban official, expressed doubt that the succession issue had been settled. ""It is still not confirmed how many Taliban have voted to replace Mullah Omar,"" he said. ""There is still a possibility of disputes between them; we will have to wait and see if those disputes will be resolved or not.""",0.0

Presidential Bid Is New for Trump; Racially Charged Talk Is Not:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. Under a dark photograph showing hypodermic needles and drug paraphernalia, the newspaper advertisement warned in dire terms that violent criminals were coming to town. ""Are these the new neighbors we want?"" the paid message asked. ""The St. Regis Mohawk Indian record of criminal activity is well documented.""The ad, part of an advocacy campaign meant to stop a casino from being built in New York's Catskill region, drew an indignant response from the tribe, which called it a naked appeal to racism. The incendiary ads, which ran in upstate newspapers in February 2000, were the work of the New York Institute for Law and Society, an opaque interest group that described itself as opposed to casino gambling.It was only later that the man who bankrolled the ads identified himself: Donald J. Trump.Long before Mr. Trump announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, roiling the 2016 election with his pugnacious style and speeches in which he has branded many undocumented immigrants as rapists and murderers, he had proved himself in New York as an expert political provocateur with an instinct for racially charged rhetoric.To communities that have clashed with Mr. Trump in the past, his current strategy is entirely familiar. The slash-and-burn offensive against casino gambling in New York was a revealing foray into local politics, but it was only one of several episodes that seem to foreshadow the tone of his presidential campaign.In 1989, amid a citywide panic in New York prompted by the assault of a white female jogger in Central Park, Mr. Trump ran advertising that called for a return of the death penalty.Later, during negotiations with the town of Palm Beach, Fla., his associates threatened through the media to sell a beachfront estate owned by Mr. Trump to the Unification Church, a Christian sect founded in South Korea and known for the practice of holding mass weddings.Mr. Trump acknowledged that his style can be offensive to some, but he defended it as essential for communicating his message.""It would be nice to be somewhat gentler,"" he said in an interview this week, ""but at the same time, I don't think I would be able to make the point nearly as well, whether it's the death penalty or other things, totally unrelated.""Mr. Trump said it was ""not my intention"" to speak in racially provocative terms, but expressed little interest in softening his language. ""It's very time-consuming to be politically correct,"" he said, ""and I don't like wasting a lot of time.""He has used divisive rhetoric to advance his business interests: His drive against the St. Regis Mohawks was intended to protect his investments in Atlantic City at the time, by blocking casino development in a competing market. Mr. Trump, who stood by the content of the newspaper and television ads he paid for, said he had made a ""tremendous amount of money in Atlantic City"" and did not want to see gamblers migrating elsewhere.""I wasn't knocking the Mohawks; I was knocking their record,"" Mr. Trump said. ""That's not because they're Mohawks. That's because their record is bad and was proved to be bad at the time.""The ads shocked local tribal leaders, who took out their own newspaper ad in response to denounce the ""racist and inflammatory rhetoric of this sham Institute.""""How dare they smear a nation and brand us all as criminals,"" the ad said.The anti-St. Regis ads drew the scrutiny of New York's lobbying commission, and Mr. Trump acknowledged that he was the New York Institute for Law and Society's primary sponsor. In a settlement with the state, he and his advisers agreed to pay a fine and run a set of ads apologizing, not for the content of the anti-Mohawk ads, but for evading state disclosure rules related to lobbying and political advocacy.The new ads expressed regret ""if anyone was misled concerning the production and funding of the lobbying effort,"" according to settlement documents obtained through a state records request.Rowena General, who was chief of staff for the St. Regis Mohawks in 2000, said Mr. Trump's ad campaign was a cynical attempt to use fear about race and crime to protect his business investments. The tenor of his presidential campaign, she said, was ""not surprising at all, considering our experience with him.""Eleven years earlier, Mr. Trump had financed what was perhaps an even more charged advertisement days after the brutal assault on the jogger in Central Park. The ad, in the form of an open letter from Mr. Trump, was topped with two sentences that blared: ""Bring Back the Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!""The message, which appeared in four publications, including The New York Times, channeled widespread anger and fear about violent crime. Invoking the image of ""roving bands of wild criminals"" wreaking havoc on the streets, Mr. Trump's letter rebuked Mayor Edward I. Koch, a Democrat who supported the death penalty, for urging New Yorkers not to turn to hate in the aftermath of the Central Park assault.""I want to hate these muggers and murderers,"" Mr. Trump wrote in the ad. ""They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes.""The rape and near-murder in Central Park rocked New York in the midst of the 1989 mayoral race, becoming a chilling symbol of a city seemingly out of control. Over time, it also came to represent the flaws in the criminal justice system. Five teenagers, four of them black, one Latino, were arrested and imprisoned for carrying out the attack. Known as the Central Park Five, they had their convictions vacated years later after another man, Matias Reyes, confessed to the crime.State Senator Bill Perkins, a Democrat who at the time was president of the tenants' association at Schomburg Plaza, the Manhattan apartment complex where several of the defendants lived, said he was horrified to see Mr. Trump emerge as a contender for the presidency. A framed copy of Mr. Trump's 1989 newspaper ad hangs in Mr. Perkins's Harlem office as a reminder, he said, of an ugly moment in the city's recent past.""This was taking a moment, a very unfortunate and one might say racially tense moment in our city, and fueling a lynch mob,"" Mr. Perkins, who is black, said of the ad. ""This is the Donald Trump that we have to remember as we pay attention to his ranting, his continuous ranting and carrying on.""Mr. Trump said that the ad was motivated purely by his support for reinstituting the death penalty and that it did not have a racial component. He said he remained a strong proponent of capital punishment and called it a necessary deterrent to violent crime.""This had nothing to do with race,"" he said. ""I have always been a big believer, and continue to be, of the death penalty for horrendous crime.""He added that he had no regrets about the ad, though he noted that because the victim of the assault had survived, the death penalty would not have been appropriate.New York City last year settled a lawsuit brought by the five defendants for $41 million, without acknowledging wrongdoing.Jonathan C. Moore, a lawyer who represents four of the men, said Mr. Trump had shown an ""incredible lack of judgment"" in the Central Park case. His clients, Mr. Moore said, had been in the park on the night of the attack but had committed no crime.""Donald Trump was an example of how, mostly white people, rushed to judgment about what happened there,"" said Mr. Moore, who is white. Describing the victim and her alleged attackers, he added, ""It was a young white investment banker, and all these young black kids who looked like they were guilty.""Even now, Mr. Trump refuses to completely back down. He criticized the city's settlement, arguing that the young men had been convicted by a jury and had probably been involved in some kind of criminal activity on the night of the assault.""They walked away with $41 million and the best thing they had going for them was they were wilding in other parts of the park, beating the hell out of people,"" Mr. Trump said, using a term, popularized after the Central Park assault, for young men going on a crime spree.Two years after running the ads about the Central Park case, Mr. Trump drew accusations of racism during a lobbying effort in Palm Beach, where he was seeking to subdivide the palatial estate known as Mar-a-Lago. As he faced considerable opposition from the town, articles appeared almost simultaneously in both The New York Post and The Palm Beach Daily News reporting, based on anonymous sources, that he might sell the property to the Unification Church.The church, which was founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon and viewed by many at the time as a cult, roundly denied any interest in the property and accused Mr. Trump of using the faith as a racial and religious cudgel against officials in the Florida town. Dr. James A. Baughman, who led the church's branch in the United States at the time, said then that the church had no interest in the property. Mr. Trump, he said, was using ""the Unification Church as a scare tactic in an attempt to compel Palm Beach officials to submit to the will of Mr. Trump.""The town ultimately rejected Mr. Trump's bid to subdivide the estate, and he converted it to a private club instead. He said this week that any suggestion the property would be sold to the Unification Church ""certainly wasn't intended"" to be racial in nature.Indeed, Mr. Trump sounded incredulous at the notion. ""That's Korean,"" he said of the church. ""So now I'm against the Koreans, too, you mean?""In the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump has discussed crime and immigration in explicitly alarmist terms. He has highlighted murders committed by undocumented immigrants, and has repeatedly referred to an undocumented Mexican immigrant who has been charged with killing a young woman in San Francisco as ""this animal.""The furor over his comments led NBC to sever its ties with him: He will no longer be associated with the ""Apprentice"" franchise, and NBC's parent, NBCUniversal, said the network would no longer carry the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, part of a joint venture with Mr. Trump.He said that there might be some value in speaking with greater restraint, but that that would exact its own price: ""I might not get my point across nearly as well.""""The interesting thing is,"" he said, ""I am probably the least racist person that you will ever speak to.""",0.0
Price Electrifies Toronto's Fans With Debut for Jays:   [Sports Desk ],,"TORONTO -- When the Toronto Blue Jays acquired David Price from the Detroit Tigers last week, the objective was both to add his pitching excellence and to capitalize on his vast experience. Price has pitched in the World Series, critical playoff games and even a win-and-get-in 163rd game two years ago.But even with all those memorable moments of pitching in high-stakes baseball in September and October -- games played in front of large television audiences and sold-out stadiums -- Price said his Blue Jays debut on Monday reached a new level.""That was the best atmosphere I've ever been in,"" Price said before listing the big stages on which he has performed. ""I've pitched in quite a few big games, but that atmosphere today, that takes the cake. I've never experienced anything like that. That was cool.""Price may be as good at hyperbole as he is at throwing a baseball, but there was no mistaking his contribution to one of the most eagerly awaited games here in a long time. Price struck out 11 over eight innings, allowing one run and three hits, in a 5-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins that bolstered the Blue Jays' playoff hopes -- at least in the eyes of their ecstatic fans, who roared with delight at almost everything Price did.Price retired the last 15 batters he faced, and the reconfigured Blue Jays won for the fifth time in their last six games. They tied Minnesota for the second wild-card spot in the American League and trail the first-place Yankees in the East by five and one-half games, a substantial deficit but not an insurmountable one.""It gives us another level of confidence,"" said Josh Donaldson, who hit a two-run home run. ""I think you are going to start seeing us play our better baseball of the year.""Price became the first Blue Jays pitcher to strike out 11 batters in a debut, surpassing the mark set by Roger Clemens, who struck out nine in 1997. Price also improved to 8-0 in 10 starts at Rogers Centre; he is 6-2 with a 3.52 earned run average at Yankee Stadium, the site of his next scheduled start, on Saturday.But that game is unlikely to surpass the energy and excitement that pulsated throughout Rogers Centre on Monday. With his parents and Kevin Durant joining 45,766 playoff-starved fans soaking up the sunshine underneath the open roof, Price put on a show befitting his status as resident ace.Price was traded July 30 for Daniel Norris, Jairo Labourt and Matt Boyd, three young left-handed pitchers, and his arrival has energized a fan base that has not seen a playoff game at home since 1993. One excited young boy fashioned a makeshift Price No. 14 jersey out of blue tape, and when Price saw a photo of it on Twitter, he found out the boy's identity and sent him a proper jersey.Before the game, Price walked through the Jays' clubhouse and saw catcher Russell Martin poring over recent film of Price in order to gain an insight into his new battery mate. Price, for his part, said he had long admired Martin's work behind the plate, especially setting targets and framing pitches for umpires.That familiarity and extra work paid off, as Martin and Price found a syncopation that mesmerized Twins hitters: The only damage came on a solo homer run by Torii Hunter in the second inning.""It went as smooth as it could have went,"" Price said, referring to working with Martin. ""I saw him sitting in the video room for probably 45 minutes to an hour just watching me pitch and just seeing what I like to do out there. He was spot on.""The high point came in the fourth inning when the Twins loaded the bases with nobody out. Martin went to the mound and told Price to worry only about the next batter. They would figure things out from there.Price induced a soft fly ball from Eddie Rosario that was chased down nicely in shallow center field by shortstop Troy Tulowitzki -- another recent addition to the Blue Jays. Tulowitzki turned and fired back to the infield to prevent a run from scoring.From his position backing up home plate, Price clapped along with the relieved fans, then proceeded to strike out Aaron Hicks. Then came Kurt Suzuki, who fell behind by 1-2 as the fans rose to their feet in anticipation of a strikeout.Price had been throwing most of his fastballs around 94 to 95 miles per hour, but at that point, with the score 1-1 and the outcome potentially in the balance, his arm found more juice.Suzuki fouled off a few pitches in the upper 90s, and then Price went back to the heater. He ramped it up to 97 and fired it up and away from Suzuki, who swung and missed.The fans erupted. Martin pumped his fist. Price pounded his left hand into his glove twice. The building almost seemed to quake. Minnesota never had another base runner, as Price set down five of his last 15 by strikeout and LaTroy Hawkins retired the final three.After the handshakes were done, the fans were still standing and cheering when Jays Manager John Gibbons went up to Price in front of the dugout and offered his analysis of a memorable day.""I just told him, 'Wow,' "" Gibbons said.Photograph David Price, a Playoff Veteran, Called Monday's Game ""the Best Atmosphere I've Ever Been In.""

Obama Begins His Own Push for Iran Pact:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- President Obama is rolling out a campaign of private entreaties and public advocacy over the next several weeks to build support in Congress for the nuclear deal with Iran, an effort to counter a well-financed onslaught from critics who have promised to use a monthlong congressional recess to pressure lawmakers to oppose the accord.In a speech at American University in Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Obama will seek to explain and defend the international agreement reached last month, which would lift some sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon.Mr. Obama, who campaigned for the presidency in 2008 promising to end wars in the Middle East, will use the speech to frame Congress's choice as the most consequential foreign policy decision since the vote to go to war in Iraq, and he will say the deal's opponents are the same people who supported that military conflict.""He will make the case that this should not even be a close call,"" a White House official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer a preview of Mr. Obama's message. The president will also say that it would be a ""historic mistake to squander this opportunity -- removing constraints on the Iranian program, unraveling the sanctions regime and damaging American credibility.""Anticipating a month of heavy lobbying and television advertising by opponents, led by the pro-Israel group Aipac, the president and members of his team are leaning on Democrats to declare their backing for the agreement before they leave Washington to face their constituents.Mr. Obama, who will decamp to Martha's Vineyard this weekend for his own two-week vacation, will have limited personal contact with wavering lawmakers, but his team has been instructed to make the president and other senior administration officials available to any skeptic with an unanswered question or concern about the deal. ""Anyone who wants a phone call will get one,"" one official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to outline internal strategy.Officials said that Mr. Obama's address on Wednesday would be followed by a series of news media interviews that would be shown next week. And the administration plans to dispatch cabinet members, including Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, the nuclear physicist who helped negotiate the accord, to travel the country outlining its provisions. Mr. Moniz will appear on Friday at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, officials said.""We are confident that a sizable number of members of Congress will put politics aside and focus on what they believe is in the best interest of the United States and our national security, and if they do, a substantial number of those who follow that path will be supportive of the agreement,"" said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. ""There's no denying that there is intense political pressure on both sides of this agreement,"" he continued, adding that officials were hoping that lawmakers would ""focus on the specific terms of the agreement.""The effort gained some momentum Tuesday as three closely watched Democratic senators -- Barbara Boxer of California, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Bill Nelson of Florida -- declared their backing, along with a handful of House Democrats. Mr. Obama's team is working with Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, to build support to potentially sustain a presidential veto of legislation rejecting the accord.But some prominent voices, including Representative Steve Israel of New York, the highest-ranking Jewish Democrat in the House; Nita Lowey, also of New York; and Ted Deutch of Florida came out against the agreement.""After a decade in public life working to stop Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons, I cannot support a deal giving Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief -- in return for letting it maintain an advanced nuclear program and the infrastructure of a threshold nuclear state,"" Mr. Deutch, the senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle East, wrote in The Sun Sentinel.Congress, which will return from its break Sept. 8, has until Sept. 17 to vote on a resolution supporting or rejecting the accord.Public opinion on the agreement has been in flux in recent weeks, with some polls indicating majorities or pluralities supporting it and others showing more opposition. J Street, a pro-Israel group that supports the deal and has announced a $2 million advertising campaign, found that a majority of American Jews supported the agreement.But Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who is a consultant to Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran, an Aipac-funded group that is planning to spend more than $25 million on advertising in the coming weeks, said that the more people knew about the deal, ""the more likely they are to disapprove of it.""""The intensity is clearly on the opposition side,"" he added.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel told thousands of American Jews in a webcast that the agreement was fatally flawed and dangerous, charging that proponents were trying to muzzle criticism of it with deceitful claims. ""As a result of this deal, there will be more terrorism, there will be more attacks, and more people will die,"" Mr. Netanyahu said.He also angrily rejected Mr. Obama's claims about the accord, particularly his argument that its opponents have no alternative other than war for reining in Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions, calling it ""utterly false.""Mr. Netanyahu's latest plea to American Jews came as Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met privately at the White House with about 20 leaders of Jewish groups to try to allay concerns about the deal, the first such session since the pact was completed.During a meeting in the Cabinet Room that lasted more than two hours, some of the leaders criticized Mr. Obama for portraying opponents of the deal ""basically as warmongers,"" one attendee said. The president said he would ""be very careful about it,"" but added that he would not hesitate to argue forcefully for the agreement, which he sees as being in the best interest of both the United States and Israel.The White House also posted a copy of the 159-page agreement on the website Medium, annotated with comments from Secretary of State John Kerry, Mr. Moniz and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. ""It's important that everyone understands exactly what's in this deal and how it'll work,"" the White House said in a preface to the post.",0.0
"Midcentury Chic at Loosie Rouge, in Williamsburg's South Side:   [Style Desk ]",,"For longtime Williamsburg denizens, the area's North Side now feels like a grim ""Mad Max"" wasteland patrolled by clean-cut conquistadors in hipster Halloween costumes. Seeking cooler climes, the neighborhood's holdouts now huddle in a South Side oasis along Broadway, just south of the Williamsburg Bridge, where new spots like Loosie Rouge have cropped up around the stately century-old street.With its windows cast open to the street on a toasty Saturday night, Loosie Rouge lured night crawlers coming from dinner at Diner or gassing up for a show at Baby's All Right. Talk was of the Governor's Ball and Bushwick Open Studios earlier that day, with the words ""amazing"" and ""nightmare"" being used almost interchangeably.The PlaceJust south of the Williamsburg Bridge, where passing J trains, cast-iron lofts and sooty brick-stack buildings provide unimpeachable old New York atmospherics. The apartment-size bar's magic-hour glow and midcentury Scandinavian décor will make you curse your own digs, and add up to an inviting je ne sais quoi. ""I really like it,"" Uma Madan, a Brooklyn-based beauty writer said on a recent night. ""It feels so Euro,"" she added, before conceding that she'd never actually visited the continent.The CrowdNearly all the guests are chugging into their 30s and look dressed for an al fresco dinner party in Tulum, with men in botanical-print Hawaiian shirts and women in witchy blacks and geometric jewelry. Early evenings are serene, as fledgling couples flirt and wingmates scheme. After 11 p.m., a thirstier set rolls in, clamoring for cocktails at the bar and perhaps a reason to pocket one of the sleepover toothbrushes Loosie Rouge provides in its loo.PlaylistOne recent weeknight, Cypress Hill triggered pot flashbacks.

A Hacking Epidemic That Hits Few Consumers in the Wallet:   [Money and Business/Financial Desk ],,"At Target, 40 million customers had their credit card information exposed to hackers. At JPMorgan Chase, personal details associated with 80 million accounts were leaked. Last month, a hacker gained access to 4.5 million records from the University of California, Los Angeles, health system.Enormous numbers like these can make it feel as if we're living through an epidemic of data breaches, in which no one's bank account or credit card is safe. But the actual effect on consumers is quite different from what the headlines suggest. Only a tiny number of people exposed by leaks end up paying any costs, and for the rare victims who do, the average cost has actually been falling steadily.How could that be? For starters, several laws protect consumers from bearing almost any financial losses related to hackers (though not the headaches of having to enter new credit card numbers into Amazon and elsewhere). Instead, banks and merchants, like Target, must bear the cost. But even their losses have been dropping in recent years, as data security experts have learned new strategies to prevent intrusions from turning into theft.""The bad guys are getting good,"" said David Robertson, the publisher of The Nilson Report, a data provider for the card industry, ""and the good guys are getting even better.""It's true that data breaches, particularly those in which Social Security numbers are compromised, can lead to a more devastating sort of identity theft, in which criminals open new financial accounts in a person's name and do damage that can take years and a lot of work to clean up. But consumers are almost never on the hook for financial losses in these sorts of episodes, which, by the way, have also been on the decline.This relatively sanguine picture of the impact of data breaches is an example of a threat that looks worse than it turns out to be. The sheer size of hackings shocks and startles when the attacks are first reported, but it's rare that journalists check on the actual consequences.Moreover, consumer fears can be stoked by the incentives of the people providing the data. Many of the statistics on identity fraud and online attacks come from security firms that want more people to buy their services. It's not so different from the soap company that advertises how many different types of bacteria are on a subway pole without mentioning how unlikely it is that any of those bacteria would make you sick.One of the most memorable statistics on identity fraud comes from advertisements that say a new victim is created every two seconds. That figure, which comes from Javelin Strategy and Research, is largely attributable to standard credit card fraud, in which criminals use a stolen credit card number to buy goods -- not the sort of thing most people imagine when they think of identity fraud. The more troubling identity theft, in which new accounts are opened in an unsuspecting person's name, make up only 5 percent of the total figure given by Javelin.These statistics do not mean that data security is not a real issue for authorities and consumers to think about. Even if the hackers don't use your credit cards, there are instances in which leaked data of other kinds can be damaging in itself, as was clear in the recent episodes at Sony Pictures and Ashley Madison, the website that connects prospective adulterers. There are also serious geopolitical concerns about foreign hackers compromising national security if they get a hold of military maps or staff lists from the C.I.A.For the companies and banks that bear the cost of stolen credit card numbers, the expenses are very real. Criminals racked up $7.8 billion in fraudulent purchases last year, with banks paying 62 percent of that amount and merchants the rest, according to The Nilson Report.The banks, though, have managed to curtail their costs as they have devised new methods to detect fraudulent purchases. The most prevalent strategy involves looking for patterns in card purchases, but some banks have even taken to buying stolen cards on the black market to identify breaches, security experts say.In the aftermath of the Target breach, in late 2013, the American Bankers Association said that the biggest expense for the banks was not the fraud but rather the cost of reissuing the cards and dealing with concerned customers.For JPMorgan, the costs after the 2014 intrusion were much more limited because the attackers took only email addresses and phone numbers, the type of information that is not hard to attain through other, legal channels.Consumer advocates generally say that the most important thing to pay attention to after a data breach is the type of information stolen. Karen Barney, a program director at the Identity Theft Resource Center, said that to commit true identity theft, hackers generally need to get a hold of Social Security numbers.""Social Security numbers are the be-all and end-all for successful attempts at identity theft,"" Ms. Barney said.While those nine-digit identifiers weren't made vulnerable in any of the big data leaks at retailers, they were exposed in this month's intrusion at U.C.L.A.'s health system and in the recent break-in at the federal government's Office of Personnel Management.To prevent fraud in the first place, banks are currently introducing cards with so-called E.M.V. chips, which make counterfeiting cards -- currently the most prevalent sort of fraud -- much more difficult.Though serious identity theft has been on the decline in recent years, many security experts are expecting that to change as dedicated criminals, whose easy counterfeiting is foiled by E.M.V. chips, start to focus on getting Social Security numbers and other data that enables them to open new accounts, said Mr. Robertson, of The Nilson Report.""For the bad guys, your five-year growth plan is not data breaches and stealing credit cards,"" Mr. Robertson said. ""It involves stealing all the info you can and opening legitimate accounts in people's names.""Ultimately, the problem will still require businesses, and individuals, to stop the thefts from happening in the first place.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

Judge Delays Man's Retrial in Patz Case Until Feb. 22:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"A judge on Monday delayed the retrial of a man accused of murdering Etan Patz until Feb. 22 to give a newly appointed prosecutor more time to prepare in one of the country's most infamous child-abduction cases.Justice Maxwell Wiley set the new date at a heated hearing, during which the lead prosecutor, Joel J. Seidemann, asked the court to impose an order of silence on defense lawyers, arguing that statements outside court to reporters might influence jurors.Mr. Seidemann said a court order was necessary because the lead defense lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, had briefed reporters outside court almost every day of the first trial, which ended in May with a hung jury. ""The last thing we would want in this case is for someone to read something said to a reporter in a hallway,"" he said.Mr. Fishbein shot back that he had spoken to reporters only to counter adverse publicity about his client coming from other sources, which is allowed under the American Bar Association's professional rules of conduct. ""There is no reason for a gag order here,"" he said.Justice Wiley said he also saw no need for a formal order. ""Everyone knows the rules, and we will abide by them,"" he said, eyeing both sides.Pedro Hernandez, 54, of Maple Shade, N.J., is accused of kidnapping and strangling Etan on May 25, 1979. That day, Etan, who was 6, disappeared while walking from his parents' loft in SoHo to a school bus stop two blocks away. At the time, Mr. Hernandez was a clerk in a bodega next to the bus stop, at West Broadway and Prince Street.Thirty-three years later, Mr. Hernandez was arrested on a tip from one of his relatives. After a long interrogation, he gave a confession to the police, later repeating it to a prosecutor.He said he lured Etan into the bodega basement with a soda and strangled him. He left the body, he said, in a box with some trash in a subterranean passageway a block and a half away. Etan's remains were never found. There was no physical evidence linking Mr. Hernandez to the crime.Mr. Hernandez's lawyers contend the confession is a fiction, the invention of a man with a low intelligence score and a personality disorder that clouds his ability to tell reality from fantasy.Mr. Seidemann, a senior trial counsel with years of experience in homicide cases, took over the prosecution from Joan Illuzzi in June, after she resigned to run for Staten Island district attorney.Mr. Fishbein opposed Justice Wiley's decision to put off the start of the new trial until February. Raising his voice, he pointed out that Mr. Hernandez had been in jail for four years, and, while Mr. Seidemann was just assigned to the case, two other prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office assisted Ms. Illuzzi in the first trial and could easily take over.But Judge Wiley said Mr. Seidemann's request for more time was reasonable. The records in the case stretch back 36 years and are voluminous, he said.""Mr. Seidemann is lead counsel,"" the judge said. ""He has to know what he's doing.""Since the hung jury was declared on May 8, even former jurors have stepped into the spotlight. The lone holdout for acquittal gave several interviews, defending his stance. Seven jurors who had voted to convict held a memorial service for Etan this year on the anniversary of his disappearance, and some of them have shown up for Mr. Hernandez's court appearances.On Monday, three of the pro-guilty jurors sat in court next to Etan's father, Stanley Patz, talking to him about the trial. Later, they said they were there to support the new prosecutor, with whom they met privately after the hearing. ""This has become part of our lives now,"" one ex-juror, Joan Brooks, said.",0.0
Head of Nonesuch to Step Down:   [Brief ],,"When executives at big record companies leave their jobs, there is usually a quick announcement and a scramble behind the scenes to install a new regime. Not so with the long sunset for Robert Hurwitz of Nonesuch Records, the prestigious Warner Music imprint that is home to acts as varied as Steve Reich, Laurie Anderson and the Black Keys.Warner will announce this week that Mr. Hurwitz, 66, who has been Nonesuch's president since 1984, will step down at the end of next year as part of a gradual leadership change. Starting in 2017, Mr. Hurwitz will become the label's chairman emeritus and continue to work as executive producer on 10 to 12 albums a year.""When I proposed all of this to the people that run Warner, we found a way to create a real transition,"" Mr. Hurwitz said in an interview. ""Nonesuch is too important to have it just go from day to day.""Nonesuch, founded in 1964 as a budget classical branch of Elektra Records, holds an unusual position in the record business both for its diverse catalog and for the stability of its management. The label's roster bridges classical, jazz, world and adult-oriented pop. Its most recent releases include work by the Kronos Quartet, the singer-songwriter Lianne La Havas and the jazz players Joshua Redman and the Bad Plus -- and over the years it has scored huge if unlikely hits like ""Buena Vista Social Club"" and Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No. 3.""For the past three decades, Bob's vision, intelligence and impeccable taste have driven Nonesuch to an incomparable level of musical artistry and distinction,"" Steve Cooper, chief executive of the Warner Music Group, said in a statement. ""In typical unorthodox fashion, rather than retiring, Bob has chosen a less-well-beaten path for the years ahead.""Among the activities Mr. Hurwitz said he would pursue in the future were tending to some 15,000 pages of his journals documenting, he said, ""every day of the last 30 years at Nonesuch,"" and going through a correspondence of hundreds of letters with musicians. Among the first artists Mr. Hurwitz signed were the composers John Adams and Mr. Reich, both of whom remain with the label. Mr. Reich and Philip Glass's onstage reunion was among the highlights of a three-week festival last season at the Brooklyn Academy of Music celebrating Nonesuch's 50th anniversary.""A lot of people have been around a lot of great artists,"" Mr. Hurwitz said. ""But I don't know of a lot of people who have been around the range of artists in all those different genres that I've been around.""Warner has not announced a replacement for Mr. Hurwitz, but a likely candidate is said to be David Bither, the label's senior vice president, who has been with Nonesuch since 1995 and was instrumental in signing acts like Wilco, Robert Plant, Youssou N'Dour and the Black Keys.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",0.0
Convenient Myth: A Living Taliban Chief:   [News Analysis ],,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- The Taliban, it turns out, had been sending the world messages from a dead man. And the world kept answering him.It continued until last month, when the Taliban issued a statement in the name of their supreme leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, intended to ""elucidate some issues about the previous and present ongoing jihadi struggle."" In it, Mullah Omar seemed open to the idea of peace negotiations, raising hopes in Kabul.The reclusive Mullah Omar, of course, had not been seen in public in nearly 14 years, and some of his commanders, having last heard from him around 2008 or 2009, had been demanding proof of life.Mullah Omar, according to the Afghan spy service and some Taliban officials, had already been dead for more than two years -- as many Afghan officials strongly suspected.Still, President Ashraf Ghani, who had gone all out for months to open talks with the Taliban, said before news cameras that he was encouraged by Mullah Omar's latest words, characterizing him as having said that ""negotiation is the solution.""For every major player in the Afghan war -- the Afghan government, the Taliban, the United States and Pakistan -- Mullah Omar and the unity his name imposed on the Afghan insurgency became convenient in some way, either politically or militarily.How the insurgent leader's death remained a secret for so long is a striking phenomenon that illuminates some of the murkier dynamics of the war in Afghanistan.For the Taliban, news of Mullah Omar's death risked fracturing an insurgency that has not just held together, but grown over a decade. No successor was likely to be as unifying in life as Mullah Omar proved to be even in death.His name, and his rank -- emir of the faithful -- became a kind of talisman against defection to competing groups. When some Taliban-allied commanders finally began jumping ship this past year, some to pledge loyalty to the Islamic State, they cited growing evidence of Mullah Omar's death as the reason.Mullah Omar's deputies drew much of their authority from their association, real or perceived, with the cleric, who the Afghan spy service said died in a Pakistani hospital in April 2013.So until last month, the Taliban continued to issue in Mullah Omar's name intermittent statements, marking holidays, bolstering morale and excoriating the government in Kabul and foreign invaders.The more complicated part is that Afghan, American and European officials largely went along, even though many privately acknowledged that Mullah Omar, alive or dead, was completely emeritus.Back in January, after the official end of the NATO combat mission in Afghanistan, the Pentagon hinted that Mullah Omar possibly remained a dangerous enemy. ""To the degree he is still targeting our Afghan allies and U.S. troops, yes, he remains a threat,"" the Pentagon's press secretary said.Diplomats made talking about Mullah Omar a kind of parlor game, compulsively discussing the latest official statements.""If you had never gotten confirmation that Mullah Omar had died, this would have gone on until he was 110,"" said the European Union's representative to Afghanistan, Franz-Michael Mellbin. ""When they would say 'Mullah Omar issued this statement,' I would say, 'No, he didn't; he's not around.' That's been my line.""Some Afghans wondered why the Taliban's enemies seemed willing to keep breathing life into Mullah Omar.""America especially should have undermined the notion that Mullah Omar was alive,"" said Hajji Atta Mohammad Ahmadi, the head of Kandahar's peace council. He said this would have helped uncover who actually led the Taliban, important information to ""conduct peace talks from the standpoint of reliable knowledge.""Yet for officials seeking peace negotiations, which are central to the long-term American hopes for Afghanistan, it was preferable that the insurgency possessed a clear hierarchy that could choose negotiators and decide terms. With Mullah Omar's myth intact, the Taliban possessed that.Moreover, any Taliban statements that sounded remotely like a peace overture were usually said to have Mullah Omar's imprimatur. There was the time Mullah Omar was said to have sanctioned the opening of a political office in Qatar. And this year, Mullah Omar's name was invoked during a nascent peace process, which stalled when his death was acknowledged last week.""It doesn't make sense to undermine a leader who sounds as though he is coming around to the idea of peace,"" a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group in Kabul, Graeme Smith, said, offering an explanation for why diplomats might have gone along with treating Mullah Omar as alive and relevant.Pakistani officials have also invoked Mullah Omar's name. As Pakistani officials told Afghanistan in recent months that they would try to get a Taliban delegation to meet with the Afghan government, the Pakistanis, perhaps to lower expectations, added a caveat: It depended on Mullah Omar's blessing, two Afghan officials familiar with the discussions said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomacy.Pakistani officials deny that Mullah Omar ever lived in their country. But American and some, though not all, Afghan officials claim he had been living there for years. If it is true that Mullah Omar died in a Karachi-area hospital two years ago, it seems unlikely that Pakistani security officials would not have known he was dead even when they were evoking his name in the peace process.Again, the myth of an engaged Mullah Omar proved handy. It bolstered Pakistan's public argument that the Afghan Taliban were autonomous, even while the Pakistani security forces kept themselves at the center of the peace talks by pressuring senior Taliban members to take part.Some Western officials suggest that Mullah Omar's myth became somewhat comfortable for a few reasons. No one knew what might come after. And over the course of a long war it helped obscure a discomfiting truth: The identities and motives of the insurgents, and their various factions, often remained opaque.At times, the idea of Mullah Omar helped keep ""hidden a simple truth that we don't really know what's going on or who we're fighting on any given day, and who their backers are,"" a Western official in Kabul said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering colleagues.Underlying it all, too, was the difficulty of getting reliable intelligence on a man who, even when known to be alive, had cloaked himself in a calculated unapproachability.""It was not out of convenience so much as the fact that while there wasn't hard evidence he was alive, there certainly wasn't any he was dead,"" said James F. Dobbins, who was the State Department's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2013 and 2014. ""We wondered, but in the absence of any evidence that he passed away, we simply operated under the assumption that he might still be living.""Mr. Dobbins was not surprised at how little was ever learned about Mullah Omar's whereabouts.""Look how long it took us to find Bin Laden, and we were looking a lot harder for him,"" said Mr. Dobbins, who is now at the RAND Corporation. Asked why the search for Mullah Omar had not taken on greater urgency, Mr. Dobbins replied, ""I guess the answer is: What difference would it have made?""He added, ""Whether he was alive or not, the Taliban was operating in a coherent, unified fashion in his name.""All that raises the question: If the United States government had learned of Mullah Omar's death, would it have acknowledged it?""We would have had to decide whether to announce it or not,"" Mr. Dobbins said. ""We never faced that.""",0.0
Police Step Up Terror Battle in New York:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"In January, several days after heavily armed terrorists attacked Charlie Hebdo, a satirical newspaper in Paris, top officials with the New York Police Department held a drill to test the city's response to such an attack and found they had a problem.As officers converged on 42nd Street in Manhattan near the United Nations headquarters, some took nearly an hour to get there. Others coming from plainclothes organized-crime and narcotics units in far-flung precincts in Brooklyn and Queens, did not look the part: street clothes, facial hair, semiautomatic weapons that did not match those being carried by colleagues in uniform.""One of the observers said they look a little too much like the bad guys,"" John J. Miller, the deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, said, describing the drill.Out of that moment came the formation of a standing counterterrorism force whose initial platoon of 100 officers rolled out on Monday and whose ranks will swell to 527 officers by the end of the year, much bigger than any of the ad-hoc units that the department has deployed in the years since the Sept. 11 attacks. The new unit, composed of experienced officers, was made possible in part by an expansion of the overall head count in the department this year.The timing, three days after the devastating attacks on Paris by teams of terrorists from the Islamic State, was coincidental. But it highlighted the message that New York police officers were going on ""offense and defense"" in response to terrorism threats, as the police commissioner, William J. Bratton, has said in a series of interviews and speeches over the last week.The story of how the new unit, known as the Critical Response Command, came into being traces the history of the city's evolving approach to terrorism, from the creation of the counterterrorism and intelligence divisions in the months after the attacks of 2001, to 2004, when the Police Department began pulling precinct officers into counterterrorism details, to the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, when officials realized they needed more firepower and officers trained to respond to multiple, simultaneous attacks.The attacks in Paris last week, officials said, validated their idea that a permanent force -- one that could be rapidly dispatched with the appropriate armor and weaponry -- was needed to counter heavily armed assailants.But even as the Police Department augments its ability to defend targets and respond to an attack, Mr. Bratton and other law enforcement leaders have complained that the emergence of technological hurdles is hampering the digital surveillance of terrorism suspects, as well as stymying the prosecutions of scores of criminal cases.""We, in many respects, have gone blind,"" Mr. Bratton said on Sunday, referring to apps that encrypt messages and smartphones that are inaccessible even with a search warrant.His comments, and those of James B. Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in New York on Wednesday, revived a longstanding debate between law enforcement officials and technology companies, one that had appeared settled last month when the Obama administration opted not to champion legislation requiring access to encrypted communications.The twin messages -- of a city better defended than ever, of intelligence capabilities hamstrung by ""misguided efforts"" by Silicon Valley companies, in the words of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. -- showed the pressure felt by police officials as New Yorkers go warily through their routines following the attacks in Paris last week.""I talked to a woman who works at a doctor's office this morning, and she knows what I do, and she says, 'I have to ask you, is it O.K. to ride the subway?' "" said Chief James R. Waters, the head of the department's Counterterrorism Bureau since 2008.""And I said to her, 'Absolutely it is,' "" the chief said. ""It happened in Paris, could it happen in New York? And short answer is yes. The long answer is, we are, in the New York Police Department, we are the most well-prepared police department in the country, if not the world.""On Friday, Mr. Bratton made a public show of riding the subway in Manhattan to allay concerns.With the new unit, Chief Waters's bureau has ballooned this year in size and in equipment, with new cars fitted to hold Colt M4 semiautomatic assault rifles. He said the attacks last week had accelerated the pace of procuring equipment and training officers in counterterrorism tactics, including courses that include undercover ""hostile surveillance"" to detect those who might be gathering information about potential targets, and the use of new devices.At the Police Academy on Thursday, a class of about 120 officers listened to instructions on terrorism threats as well as how to use ""personal radiation devices"" to detect potential hazards. The training lecture for the new unit included discussion of the four types of radiation -- alpha, beta, gamma, neutron -- as well as more practical information, such as the possibility that a person, or even a cat, could trip the device after a medical procedure.In addition to the Critical Response Command, the department recently created a citywide unit of roughly 700 patrol officers -- the Strategic Response Group -- who are also trained to use and are outfitted with semiautomatic rifles. The weaponry represents a marked escalation in the arming of the department. Whereas in the past, only the Emergency Services Unit had assault riles in their vehicles, the department is in the process of roughly tripling the number of high-powered rifles at the ready in patrol cars to ensure that every officer trained to use them has quick access to them.""It's a big change in the department,"" said Chief Waters, who compared it to a decision in 1990 to upgrade the weapon given to the city's transit officers, from revolvers to semiautomatic handguns. ""There was a clear need to move to the next level.""The fear, for some city officials as well as for Mr. Comey, is that as officers gear up for the next attack, the job of preventing it has grown harder -- the ""offense"" part of Mr. Bratton's message. That is because the people who might be planning an attack have disappeared from digital sight behind a wall of encrypted communications.""At that moment, the needle we have been searching the entire nation to find, and have found, goes invisible to us,"" Mr. Comey said in New York on Wednesday, describing how Islamic State fighters move their potential recruits from conversations on Twitter to encrypted apps.However, the White House in October concluded that any ""back door"" that would allow law enforcement access to encrypted data would also create an opening that those same terrorists, as well as cybercriminals, foreign governments and others, could exploit.""People shouldn't equate encryption with terrorism,"" said Stephen Schulhofer, a professor at the New York University School of Law who has written on the Fourth Amendment in the digital age. ""Terrorists may encrypt their messages, but not everybody who encrypts their messages is a terrorist. The ratio is probably two billion to one.""With avenues for electronic surveillance closing, according to officials, the Police Department will be pressed to develop better sources on the ground in communities around the city.""It absolutely stresses the capability for the intelligence agencies,"" said Mitchell D. Silber, a former director of intelligence analysis for the Police Department. ""It puts more of a premium on human intel.""But offsetting digital surveillance with so-called human intelligence gathering presents particular challenges in the city, where the Police Department's actions in Muslim communities have been challenged in federal court. Mayor Bill de Blasio last year announced the formal end to what had been known as the Demographics Unit, made up of detectives given the task of mapping populations in Muslim neighborhoods. Critics contend that while the name has changed, the tactics have not.""We have no evidence that they've ended the suspicionless surveillance against Muslim communities, which is at the heart of the lawsuit,"" said Baher Azmy, the legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, which is representing plaintiffs in a suit over the Police Department's surveillance of Muslims in New Jersey.Mr. Bratton, speaking to reporters on Tuesday, bristled at the mention of the Demographics Unit, which he said had been irrelevant to the department's intelligence efforts and had gone dormant by the time he returned as commissioner last year.""We have many other ways that we gather intelligence in the department,"" he said. ""There is an ability to keep a thumb on the pulse of what's going on out there."" For example, he said, detectives conduct surveillance in active investigations, and the department is building relationships with Muslims across the city.The trouble, according to counterterrorism experts, is that the perception of discriminatory practices by the Police Department in Muslim communities reduces the willingness of many to work with officers in rooting out potential terrorism threats.The new Critical Response officers, who will roam the city, anywhere from Times Square to Main Street in Flushing, Queens, appearing in different configurations and at different times of day, act as a deterrent to would-be attackers, officials said, and a kind of standing force ready to race to the scene of a strike in minutes.""After Charlie Hebdo, I said, 'Let's drill this,' "" said Mr. Miller, the deputy commissioner.At the time, the Police Department was relying on a first layer of protection -- about 100 patrol officers borrowed for the day from each precinct to go to potential targets -- and a second layer of response in the form of officers from the Organized Crime Control Bureau, who were trained after the Mumbai attack to use semiautomatic rifles. But those officers did not keep the weapons close at hand in their day-to-day work, which includes plainclothes operations in which some officers seek to blend into their surroundings. Mobilizing and equipping them at a moment's notice took time, the department found.""Do they have the guns with them? No, the guns are back at the office. Are the guns loaded? No,"" Mr. Miller said. ""The test we ran, it was suboptimal.""The department has, over the last year, ""double or tripled our ability to respond to a situation where there are multiple locations, multiple shooters,"" he said.""Those minutes,"" he continued, ""are critical.""Photograph Members of the Critical Response Command, a New Counterterrorism Unit in the Police Department.

"Garbage Collection, With No Noise or Smell:   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"In New York, the sound of trash may be as familiar as its smell.The booming thunder of an 18-ton garbage truck rumbling down the city's rutted roads. The screeching hum of the compactor, the pops and crackles of the refuse within. The honk, honk, hooooooonk of traffic backing up behind it.On Roosevelt Island, the sonics of garbage are the jet-engine roar of a 1,000-horsepower vacuum buried within the bowels of this two-mile spit of land. Not that most residents would know it. All they hear are birds chirping, joggers panting and water rippling in the East River as pneumatic tubes buried beneath their feet do the dirty work, silently sucking garbage from their buildings at 60 miles per hour.This invisible garbage has other benefits, too, especially at this time of year.""It's nice to walk out your door, and it doesn't smell like a heaping pile of trash, like in Manhattan,"" Abbie Kulhowvick, a former Upper East Side resident, said as she walked home from work last week.Roosevelt Island was envisioned with full 1970s zeal as a utopian place with affordable if somewhat Soviet-style housing in a car-free landscape. While vehicles still found their way onto the island, garbage trucks were largely banished, thanks to the pneumatic tube system, one of the largest in the world. It sucks up roughly 10 tons of trash from the island's 12,000 residents each day.And this ravenous behemoth is only growing.Last month, Riverwalk Point opened. The 266-unit apartment building is about as tall -- and the same striking red -- as the smokestacks of the Ravenswood power plant across the river in Long Island City, Queens. It is the seventh Riverwalk tower to be built at the foot of the tram over the past decade. Two more are planned, bringing the total number of apartment buildings on Roosevelt Island to 25.For Roosevelt Island residents, using the Automatic Vacuum Assisted Collections System, known as Avacs, is as simple as taking out the trash. After they drop garbage down chutes in their buildings, it collects at the bottom until a trapdoor is activated, releasing the waste into 22-inch-wide red steel tubes that run underground.Roughly five times a day -- fewer in the summer, more on holidays -- Department of Sanitation employees flip switches to pull garbage into the island's Central Collections and Compaction Plant. Despite its futuristic job, Avacs, largely unchanged since it began operating in 1976, is surprisingly mechanical. There are no computer screens, just six dials for pressure and air speed.""You can tell everything going on in the system just from these dials,"" Scott Langdon, a stationary engineer called Bones (everyone at the plant gets a nickname), said in the glass-enclosed control room.As the needles bob back and forth during three-second bursts of suction, Roosevelt Island's waste is pulled into collection chambers, one for the east side and one for the west side. The trash is then compressed into large green trash bins and driven off the island, either to a nearby marine transfer station or to New Jersey.For a sanitation center, the plant appears remarkably clean. The painted concrete floors are spotless but for some flecks of dust. The air carries a slightly ripe scent, like shrink-wrapped peaches, but hardly the olfactory assault one would expect among dozens of tons of trash, or even a New York City sidewalk in the middle of summer.More than the lack of trucks, this may be the system's greatest virtue, the cleanliness it exudes -- or rather the filth that it does not. Within the plant, this commitment to cleanliness is a practical matter, too.""If even a speck of something got into one of the machines, it could break down, or even explode,"" Mr. Langdon said.The employees operating Avacs have never collected trash from the streets, and instead have backgrounds as mechanics and maintenance workers more familiar with boilers and centrifuges than garbage bags. The problems they encounter on a weekly basis come in all shapes and sizes, though the source is the same: people throwing out what they should not. The workers devise all kinds of lassos, iron crosses ""and other medieval devices,"" as Mr. Langdon put it, to clear the tubes.When serious problems occur, such as damage to the tubes -- steel plate is strong, but can withstand only so many high-speed impacts -- a crew from Sweden, a world leader in pneumatic garbage, makes the trans-Atlantic journey to slide through the tubes and patch holes.The more troublesome trash for the tubes includes cardboard boxes and furniture. Textbooks are bad, Christmas trees worse. Oversize items, as well as recyclables, are supposed to be collected by building workers and delivered to the plant, but sometimes they wind up in the tubes with the regular trash.A jungle of large house plants, all salvaged from the trash, grows just outside the control room.""Part of me wonders why people would think it's O.K. to throw this stuff away,"" said Al DiGregorio, the chief engineer in the Sanitation Department's Bureau of Building Maintenance, which oversees Avacs. ""Part of me wonders how they ever get it in the chute.""That could be because many Roosevelt Island residents have little idea Avacs exists. ""I wasn't even sure because it sounds like something out of 'Willy Wonka,' "" Barbara Lippert, a resident for two years, said.The system's biggest fans may be the landlords, who do not worry about collecting or storing garbage. The Related Companies, developer of the Riverwalk complex, likes Avacs so much that it is installing one at Hudson Yards on the West Side of Manhattan. There, three tubes will handle trash, recycling and possibly compost.Building over the Pennsylvania Station tracks leaves no room for basements, but that is not the only consideration.""We don't want people enjoying the art or shopping beside huge piles of garbage,"" Charlotte Matthews, the vice president for sustainability at Related, said.",0.0
World Briefing | Asia; Sri Lanka: Campaign Violence Kills One:   [Brief ],,"KOTAHENA, Sri Lanka -- Sri Lanka's parliamentary election campaign took a deadly turn on Friday when unidentified gunmen opened fire into a crowd at a campaign meeting, killing one woman and injuring 12 other people.The country's finance minister, Ravi Karunanayake, was at the meeting in Kotahena, a suburb of the capital, Colombo. He said he had been leaving when gunmen in a car started spraying bullets into the crowd of about 500 attendees.""I was the target,"" Mr. Karunanayake said. ""This was an act of political terrorism.""Though he was only 20 feet from the shooting, he escaped uninjured, he said.The episode was the first major violence in a campaign that has been highly charged, with the return of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as an opposition candidate for Parliament.Mr. Karunanayake's party leads a broad political coalition that defeated Mr. Rajapaksa in his bid for re-election as president in January. The coalition has since regrouped to try to prevent Mr. Rajapaksa from winning a majority in the Aug. 17 election and becoming prime minister.Mr. Karunanayake said he suspected that the shooting on Friday may have been meant to help Mr. Rajapaksa's political comeback by spreading fear of terrorism before the election.""The attack was unprovoked,"" he said. ""These were just innocent people.""Mr. Rajapaksa's spokesman, Rohan Welivita, dismissed Mr. Karunanayake's suspicion in a telephone interview, saying it was ""ridiculous"" and ""irresponsible"" for a government minister to make such a suggestion.""Mr. Karunanayake is not the police,"" Mr. Welivita said. ""He cannot reach this conclusion without a complete investigation.""He continued: ""We totally deny these charges. Mr. Rajapaksa is in the Southern Province campaigning today. He has nothing to do with this violence.""The Center for Monitoring Election Violence, a local watchdog group, said the gunmen were dressed in black and arrived in two unmarked black cars. Citing police reports, the group said that 16 shell casings had been found at the scene, indicating that at least that many rounds were fired.Five of the wounded people were critically injured and are in the intensive care unit at a government hospital in Colombo, the group said.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",0.0
"Holiday Weekend Bargain-Hunting, for Fares and Rooms:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"Last year on the Friday after Thanksgiving, Diana Stilson snagged a stay at a Hawaiian hotel, paying 10 percent of the list price through a deal on Expedia. This Thanksgiving weekend, she hopes to find a similar vacation bargain online.After years of intense competition among retailers over Thanksgiving weekend, hotel, airline and other travel websites have entered the fray, holding sales of their own in the hope of steering holiday spending to travel and experiences.The cut-rate travel deals are already now ""standard in the industry,"" said Cole Hernandez, a spokesman for Denihan, a hotel operator. Her company has Thanksgiving weekend deals planned for its upscale hotels in Manhattan.""We saw a real jump in Black Friday-Cyber Monday hotel deals last year and expect even more this year,"" said Chris Anderson, professor of hotel administration at Cornell University. The hotels use the promotions for a variety of reasons, he said, including to attract new customers, to sell rooms that might otherwise be empty and to associate their brand with the excitement of the season.Hotels are not the only ones offering the bargains: Airlines, aggregators, tour companies and others with travel-focused websites are joining in.Customers are responding to the offers, companies say. A 2014 deal that cut the price of stays at the Hilton Waikoloa Village in Hawaii by 50 percent generated more than 11,000 booked nights in 24 hours, a significant increase compared with the daily average, according to Hilton. Grand Lucayan, a resort on Grand Bahama Island, topped $103,000 in revenue on the day of its 2014 Monday-after-Thanksgiving sale, five times the revenue generated on that day the previous year.Like many of the best-priced deals on Thanksgiving weekend, supplies are often limited. There are only so many rooms or flights that travel companies are willing to part with at the lowest prices, Mr. Anderson said. Additionally, those sales aim to be incremental and not replacing higher-revenue business.""The last thing a hotel wants is customers who would have purchased at higher prices getting access to these low prices,"" he said, so programs are devised with parameters like specific stay dates or limited room availability.Val Kalliecharan, a vacation planner on Turks and Caicos, said that sales there helped hotels fill rooms that might be vacant in their least popular times like January. ""Any holes that can be filled go directly to the bottom line,"" he said. The sales also allow hotels to sell the rooms straight to guests rather than through third-party booking sites like Expedia, Ms. Hernandez said.Expedia itself is offering deep discounts. The company tried its first large-scale Monday-after-Thanksgiving promotion last year, said Sarah Waffle Gavin, a spokeswoman for Expedia, and ended up with the third-busiest day of the year in terms of transactions. This year's post-Thanksgiving sales will be even more extensive, she said, including a mobile-only offer on Friday and promotions on Monday for 90 percent off room rates at four top-tier hotels in four cities. Every hour, the hotels and cities will change, encouraging customers to check the site often.Thanksgiving weekend travel purchases may be displacing physical purchases as experiences gain in popularity as gift items. Salina Gray hopes to find a Christmas vacation for her family instead of store-bought gifts like electronics and clothing.""It's the only time of year the whole family can go away together,"" Ms. Gray said, ""but it's also the most expensive time to travel."" If she can find a trip, she said, ""we can just shop the after-Christmas sales for a few things when we get back.""Travel companies are encouraging this shift. ""We see travel gift-giving pick up during the holiday time frame,"" Ms. Gavin said. Expedia's Hotels.com started gift cards last year to serve this market.Smaller travel companies are also joining the sale. Peggy Goldman, owner of Friendly Planet Travel in Jenkintown, Pa., is offering a 24-hour deal promoting up to $500 off her company's tours to destinations like Cuba and India. ""It's one of the most searchable sales of the year,"" she said, and plans to participate using digital marketing techniques to compete with the larger travel companies.Student Universe, a Boston travel agency that aims at students, says it holds after-Thanksgiving sales because college students are typically home with their parents over the weekend and can make large purchase decisions together for their travel.Airlines are also promoting discounts. The Alaska Airlines website is advertising a Monday sale, but no specific travel dates or destinations have been released yet. The site encourages customers to keep checking back for details. On Nov. 29-30, Fiji Airways is offering up to 40 percent off round-trip flights to Fiji, Australia and New Zealand.Travel companies are mixing and matching their delivery vehicles to reach a variety of customers. Hotwire will have an email exclusive offer on Friday, and a mobile exclusive offer on Monday, both adding savings on top of the broader sale it is holding in November.For consumers, part of the lure is the thrill of the hunt. ""The deals get snapped up quickly, so you have to be ready to hit the buy button,"" said Ms. Stilson, who found the hotel deal in Hawaii. ""But you also have to read the fine print about restrictions.""According to Ms. Gavin, it took only nine minutes for Expedia's Cyber Monday deals to sell out last year.Photograph Diana Stilson Snagged a Stay at a Hawaiian Hotel, Paying 10 Percent of the List Price Through a Deal On Expedia.; a Vacation Planner On Turks and Caicos Said That Sales There Helped Hotels Fill Rooms That Might Be Vacant During Slow Times.

What We Learned From German Prisons:   [Op-Ed ],,"EARLIER this summer, we led a delegation of people concerned about the United States criminal justice system to visit some prisons in Germany and observe their conditions. What we saw was astonishing.The men serving time wore their own clothes, not prison uniforms. When entering their cells, they slipped out of their sneakers and into slippers. They lived one person per cell. Each cell was bright with natural light, decorated with personalized items such as wall hangings, plants, family photos and colorful linens brought from home. Each cell also had its own bathroom separate from the sleeping area and a phone to call home with. The men had access to communal kitchens, with the utensils a regular kitchen would have, where they could cook fresh food purchased with wages earned in vocational programs.We hoped that we were getting a glimpse of what the future of the American criminal justice system could look like.This is an encouraging moment for American advocates of criminal justice reform. After decades of callousness and complacency, the United States has finally started to take significant steps to reverse what a recent report by the National Research Council called a ""historically unprecedented and internationally unique"" experiment in mass incarceration. Congress, in a bipartisan effort, seems prepared to scale back draconian federal sentencing laws. Many states are making progress in reducing their prison populations. And President Obama, in a gesture of his commitment to this issue, last month became the first American president to visit a federal correctional facility.The delegation that we took to Germany represented the emerging national consensus on this issue. It included a Democratic governor; corrections officials from across the political spectrum; chief prosecutors; formerly incarcerated individuals; a liberal scholar of race and criminal justice; and representatives from Right on Crime and the Charles Koch Institute, conservative groups that advocate reform, as well as the evangelical Christian group Prison Fellowship.But for all the signs of progress, truly transformative change in the United States will require us to fundamentally rethink values. How do we move from a system whose core value is retribution to one that prioritizes accountability and rehabilitation? In Germany we saw a potential model: a system that is premised on the protection of human dignity and the idea that the aim of incarceration is to prepare prisoners to lead socially responsible lives, free of crime, upon release.While the United States currently incarcerates 2.2 million people, Germany -- whose population is one-fourth the size of ours -- locks up only about 63,500, which translates to an incarceration rate that is one-tenth of ours. More than 80 percent of those convicted of crimes in Germany receive sentences of ""day fines"" (based on the offense and the offender's ability to pay). Only 5 percent end up in prison. Of those who do, about 70 percent have sentences of less than two years, with few serving more than 15 years.The incarcerated people that we saw had considerable freedom of movement around their facilities and were expected to exercise judgment about how they used their time. Many are allowed, a few times a year, to leave the prison for a few hours or overnight to visit friends and family. Others resided in ""open"" facilities in which they slept at night but left for work during the day. Solitary confinement is rare in Germany, and generally limited to no more than a few days, with four weeks being the outer extreme (as opposed to months or years in the United States).The process of training and hiring corrections officers is more demanding in Germany. Whereas the American corrections leaders in our delegation described labor shortages and training regimes of just a few months, in the German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, less than 10 percent of those who applied to be corrections officers from 2011 to 2015 were accepted to the two-year training program. This seems to produce results: In one prison we visited, there were no recorded assaults between inmates or on staff members from 2013 to 2014.Germans, like Americans, are greatly concerned with public safety. But they think about recidivism differently. During our visit, we heard prison professionals discussing failure in refreshingly unfamiliar terms: If, after release, an individual were to end up back in prison, that would be seen as a reason for the prison staff members to ask what they should have done better. When we told them stories of American politicians who closed a work-release or parole program after a single high-profile crime by a released inmate, they shook their heads in disbelief: Why would you close an otherwise effective program just because one client failed?To be sure, there are significant differences between the two countries. Most notably, America's criminal justice system was constructed in slavery's long shadow and is sustained today by the persistent forces of racism. The American prison-building binge was fueled by a political environment in which ""tough on crime"" was a winning campaign strategy.But the German context still provides a vision of a possible American future. The first article of the German Constitution reads, ""Human dignity shall be inviolable."" Granted, our own Constitution bans cruel and unusual punishment and protects individuals against excessive government intrusions. As was noted by the Supreme Court justice Anthony M. Kennedy in a landmark 2011 opinion ordering California to reduce its prison population: ""Prisoners retain the essence of human dignity inherent in all persons. Respect for that dignity animates the Eighth Amendment.""These words hold much promise, but currently they have far too little impact on actual conditions in American prisons. In Germany, we found that respect for human dignity provides palpable guidance to those who run its prisons. Through court-imposed rules, staff training and a shared mission, dignity is more than legal abstraction.The question to ask is whether we can learn something from a country that has learned from its own terrible legacy -- the Holocaust -- with an impressive commitment to promoting human dignity, especially for those in prison. This principle resonates, though still too dimly at the moment, with bedrock American values.AuthorAffiliation NICHOLAS TURNER and JEREMY TRAVIS Nicholas Turner is the president of the Vera Institute of Justice.

"Yanks Lose, but Prized Rookie Gains Kudos:   [Sports Desk ]",,"His preparations complete, Luis Severino left the bullpen and made his way across the outfield grass toward the first-base dugout. Soon, he would take the mound in a major league stadium for the first time. As he made that walk, he reflected on what the moment meant.""I felt really happy to be here,"" Severino said through an interpreter.The way Severino pitched, with a varied repertoire, an uncompromising competitiveness and a calm-beyond-his-years demeanor, left the Yankees feeling pleased, too.The Yankees lost, 2-1, baffled by the Boston Red Sox knuckleball pitcher Steven Wright, but it seemed a trifling inconvenience when viewed against what they stood to gain: a ballyhooed 21-year-old pitching prospect who lived up to every bit of his billing.For a team with a brittle starting rotation and an organization that has not produced a rotation regular since Andy Pettitte nearly 20 years ago, Severino offered encouragement. Severino allowed two runs (one earned) and just two hits -- one of them a home run by David Ortiz -- and struck out seven in five innings.Severino fell behind 13 of the 18 batters he faced, but he missed just off the edges and did not walk a batter. Six times the Red Sox ran the count full, but Severino won every battle -- including a 10-pitch at-bat that ended with a strikeout of Mike Napoli. The other run he allowed came on a two-out, second-inning double by Alejandro De Aza that scored Napoli, who had reached on third baseman Chase Headley's throwing error.The Red Sox could do little with Severino's fastball, which sat mostly at 96 miles per hour; a cut fastball; a tight slider; and a sporadically used changeup. The home run and the double were the only balls they hit out of the infield.Ortiz called Severino's pitches ""explosive,"" and Blake Swihart complimented his composure.""There's no question we'll see Severino a lot in years to come,"" Red Sox Manager John Farrell said. ""That's a good-looking young pitcher.""Severino received as many kudos from his teammates. Several used the same phrase to describe his demeanor: as if he had been here before. ""He was a bulldog,"" outfielder Chris Young said. ""And I thought his stuff was electric. He was amazing.""Severino was the 14th Yankee to make his major league debut this season, and easily the most eagerly awaited. Severino, outfielder Aaron Judge and first baseman Greg Bird are the prospects General Manager Brian Cashman refused to part with before last Friday's nonwaiver trade deadline, which nixed any chance they had to acquire any of the coveted pitchers who were available, including David Price.Such anticipation for an elite pitching prospect is not uncommon. Stephen Strasburg, Mark Prior and Matt Harvey generated a kinetic buzz when they arrived in the major leagues. But Jim Hendry -- a Cashman adviser who was the Cubs' general manager when Prior debuted -- said it was typically college pitchers who generated the most excitement because they had reached the major leagues shortly after they had been drafted.""You knew there weren't far off,"" Hendry said. ""Severino is different.""The Yankees signed Severino in 2012, but they did not have much competition and it did not become clear what type of prospect they had until he arrived in the United States the next year. He began last season at Class A Charleston and progressed quickly enough that the Yankees limited his innings and pitch counts so that he would be available to join them this season without restrictions.Manager Joe Girardi said it was not unreasonable to expect Severino to go further into games after the first-game adrenaline abates. The Yankees can certainly use more performances like Wednesday, given the delicate state of their rotation. Michael Pineda is expected to be out for a month with a strained right forearm, and Masahiro Tanaka and Ivan Nova are being treated gently while recovering from torn elbow ligaments. The erstwhile ace, C. C. Sabathia, has performed far below his standards.Headley said that while the Yankees did not swing a trade last week, as many of the other contenders did, the addition of Severino could give them that kind of boost. ""When you bring up someone that has that kind of ability, it can really swing the needle,"" Headley said.The Yankees did not swing the bats well against Wright, whose knuckleball dipped and darted, and was as hard for Swihart, the Red Sox catcher, to handle as it was for the Yankees batters to hit -- no small task against a team that had scored 90 runs in its previous 10 games. They managed only four hits and struck out nine times in eight innings against Wright, their only run coming on Carlos Beltran's solo homer.The Yankees managed to put two runners on in the ninth, but closer Koji Uehara retired Brian McCann on a fly ball to center to end the game.The Yankees were hoping from McCann what the Red Sox got from Ortiz in the fourth, when he ripped a 2-0 fastball on the inner half of the plate far into the right-field bleachers. It was his 46th career home run at the Stadium.It was also one of the few moments when Severino did look as if it was just another night in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre or Trenton, the two minor league affiliates where he pitched this season. It was, he said, about the only difference.""When you make a mistake,"" Severino said. ""You pay for it here.""INSIDE PITCHThe Yankees re-signed first baseman-outfielder GARRETT JONES on Wednesday, less than a week after they designated him for assignment when they acquired DUSTIN ACKLEY from Seattle.

A Star Swimmer's Challenging Turn:   [Sports Desk ],,"KAZAN, Russia -- The athletic superambassador Missy Franklin would seem to have more obstacles to overcome in her summer of 2015 sequel than Tom Cruise's superspy Ethan Hunt, whose latest big-screen exploits in ""Mission: Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" were watched by Franklin before she joined the United States swim team for the World Aquatics Championships.Franklin's mission, starting Sunday in this capital city of the Republic of Tatarstan, is to build on the history she made in 2013 in Barcelona, Spain, where she won a record six gold medals to increase her world championships total to nine, another record. With a victory in the 200-meter backstroke, one of her four individual events, Franklin would become the first woman to win three successive world championships in the same event.Franklin, 20, is one of the headliners in the eight-day swimming component of the competition, which has a decidedly female-centric marquee. The absence of Michael Phelps, left home as part of the fallout from his drunken-driving arrest last fall, and others like the Australian sprinter James Magnussen and the Japanese individual medley specialist Kosuke Hagino, both injured, has thrust the women into the spotlight.Can the freestyler Katie Ledecky repeat as the female swimmer of the meet after winning four golds and setting two world records in Barcelona? Will 16-year-old Daria K. Ustinova of Russia challenge Franklin in the backstroke events? How will Katinka Hosszu of Hungary fare in her seven individual events?And can Franklin hold off the likes of Ledecky, Ustinova and Hosszu and resume her reign, interrupted last summer by back spasms, as the chlorine queen?The two years since Barcelona have changed Franklin in ways that are discernible only when you wade beyond her surface sunniness -- the resplendent smile, the resonant laugh, the spontaneous dance moves and the sparkly red- and blue-painted fingernails.Franklin turned professional in March after leading the California Golden Bears to the team title at the N.C.A.A. championships, an elevation in status that has transformed her childhood passion into her first grown-up job. The transition can be fraught, said Teri McKeever, the California women's coach and a United States women's assistant coach here.""Swimming in college, you have that team support,"" McKeever said, ""and when it then becomes about their own individual performance and maybe the sponsor dollars are tied to performance, that creates challenges for people.""To traverse the oceanic gulf between swimming for fun, as part of a high school, collegiate or club team, and swimming for performance bonuses as a sports-styled entrepreneur requires a self-centeredness that is not second nature to Franklin.""That's why this next chapter of my life is going to be such an adventure,"" she said, adding with a laugh: ""I'm very worried I'm going to become high maintenance. That's my biggest fear.""The transition has been made harder by the lingering effects of a back injury that Franklin sustained at the Pan Pacific Championships last August. She experienced back spasms during one of her final practices before the meet and struggled through her events. Her best individual finish was third in the 100 backstroke.It took seven months, Franklin said, before she was able to swim a race without fear of reinjuring her back. She said the N.C.A.A. championships were ""the first meet where I was actually able to get up on the blocks and just swim.""Franklin turned in a remarkable performance at that meet, becoming the first woman to break the 1-minute-40-second barrier in the 200-yard freestyle on her way to one of her three individual victories. She also swam on two relays in her only major competition in the time leading up to the world championships.She raced in one long-course meet at the 2015 Arena Pro Swim Series in Santa Clara, Calif., in June, and produced the 18th-fastest time in the world this year in the 200-meter backstroke, her favorite event. Franklin got a late jump on her long-course preparation because she was engrossed in her studies until May. A psychology major, Franklin maintains a 3.58 grade-point average, which earned her 2015 Capital One Academic All-American of the Year honors.""I was working as hard out of the pool as I was in the pool, and that's the interesting thing,"" Franklin said. ""You know you're not going to get recognized in the newspaper for getting an A on your midterm; you're going to get recognized for going under 1:40 in the 200 free. But for me, that doesn't mean I'm going to work any less hard to get that A. To get that kind of recognition, it means the world to me.""At the end of the school year, Franklin moved back home to the Denver area to train with her childhood coach Todd Schmitz. The decision to leave Berkeley, where Franklin faced world-class competition daily, to return to her club team, the Colorado Stars, where her training partners are primarily high schoolers, raised eyebrows in swimming circles and caused consternation among the teammates she left behind.The dynamic between a club coach and a college coach can be likened to a joint-custody arrangement in parenting. Provided the parties are on the same page, the athlete can be handed off from one to the other without any trauma or drama. Communication is the key.""I think it's the coaches' responsibilities to listen to the athlete and honor the athlete's wishes,"" McKeever said.Franklin said the decision to move from one training base to the other signaled an important first step toward taking control of her career.""It was so hard doing the best thing for me but also knowing it was going to mean being away from my family out in Berkeley,"" Franklin said.In the end, the siren call of her nuclear family -- her mother, D. A.; her father, Dick; and her canine ""sibling,"" Ruger, a 12-year-old Alaskan malamute -- was too great.""I'm going through a really exciting life transition right now,"" Franklin said, ""and my parents are such a huge part of my life, I really wanted to be with my parents for this part of it.""She added, ""For me, it was a lot about family and being able to spend that time with them now.""McKeever's training regimen, which incorporates yoga, dance and spin classes with high-quality, race-pace water workouts, is distinct from Schmitz's approach, which is characterized by more yardage and less yoga.That was not the only adjustment Franklin faced. She is a more self-reliant person and swimmer than was the teenager who left Colorado two years ago, requiring a change in her dynamic with Schmitz, who filled the role of benevolent dictator in their first go-round.""It's completely different, but in a good way,"" Schmitz said. ""The way we interact with each other is 100 percent more collaborative.""Franklin gave an example that drove home her shift toward independence. During one recent week, she said, she was exhausted from training. She asked Schmitz if she could skip a midweek morning workout so she could sleep in, and make up the session over the weekend.""That was hard for me because I knew I was asking him to come in on a Saturday on his weekend off,"" Franklin said. ""That's a selfish thing to do. But I also know he's going to understand I'm going to have better workouts the rest of the week if I sleep in.""Franklin's performance over eight days starting Sunday will be treated, fairly or not, as a referendum on the path she has chosen to usher in her pro career. Franklin sounded sanguine about the next 12 months, which will culminate, she hopes, with a star turn at the 2016 Summer Olympics.""I think one of the best things an athlete can do is make the best of any situation that they're in,"" Franklin said, ""and give their best regardless of the situation.""Photograph Missy Franklin, Center, with Chelsea Chenault, Far Left, and Jessica Hardy On Thursday at the World Championships.

"My Friend, the Shoplifter:   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"Dear Diary:I know a guy. Well, actually, he knows me. Every time we see each other he always greets me by name. My response is usually, ""Hey buddy,"" ""Yo, my man,"" ""What up, bro"" or something of that nature. We might have gone to the same school -- I'm not sure; you'd have to ask him.Anyway, we bumped into each other a few days ago in front of a supermarket on Farmers Boulevard in Springfield Gardens, Queens. The weather was unseasonably warm for November, yet he was wearing one of those bulky, thermally insulated one-piece body suits, the kind Parks Department personnel wear when they're working outside in January. He entered the store before me. I stopped to get a shopping cart and walked through the automatic sliding doors no more than 30 seconds after him.By the time I had pushed the cart to the middle of the store, he was already coming toward me from the opposite direction, headed back to the entrance (which for him was now the exit). At that point, three plainclothes security guards descended upon him; they pulled him to the side, in front of the display case with the ice cream.The guards told him, ""Give it up."" He bent down and started removing items through the pants leg of his one-piece body suit: a 32-ounce plastic bag of raw black beans, several cans of goods (one of which was probably tomato sauce), a large pack of sausages and some other stuff.After strolling away and reaching the other end of the aisle, I looked back and he was still bent over, still being relieved of the contents of his one-piece body suit. As I turned the corner, I wondered if he had pulled out a box or two of yellow rice mix. It was on sale.I envied my childhood friend, whose name I can't remember. If only I could be as decisive and efficient; I wish I could shop the way he lifts -- get in and get out. Well in his case, get in and almost get out.Read all recent entries and our updated submissions guidelines.

F.B.I. Director Speaks on Race and Police Bias:   [National Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, delivered an unusually candid speech on Thursday about the difficult relationship between the police and African-Americans, saying that officers who work in neighborhoods where blacks commit crimes at a high rate develop a cynicism that shades their attitudes about race.Citing the song ""Everyone's a Little Bit Racist"" from the Broadway show ""Avenue Q,"" he said police officers of all races viewed black and white men differently. In an address to students at Georgetown University, Mr. Comey said that some officers scrutinize African-Americans more closely using a mental shortcut that ""becomes almost irresistible and maybe even rational by some lights"" because black men are arrested at much higher rates than white men.In speaking about racial issues at such length, Mr. Comey used his office in a way that none of his predecessors had. His remarks also went beyond what President Obama and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. have said since an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., in August.Mr. Comey said that his speech, which was well received by law enforcement officials, was motivated by his belief that the country had not ""had a healthy dialogue"" since the protests began in Ferguson and that he did not ""want to see those important issues drift away.""Previous F.B.I. directors had limited their public comments about race to civil rights investigations, like murders committed by the Ku Klux Klan and the bureau's wiretapping of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But Mr. Comey tried to dissect the issue layer by layer.He started by acknowledging that law enforcement had a troubled legacy when it came to race.""All of us in law enforcement must be honest enough to acknowledge that much of our history is not pretty,"" he said. ""At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups.""Mr. Comey said there was significant research showing that all people have unconscious racial biases. Law enforcement officers, he said, need ""to design systems and processes to overcome that very human part of us all.""""Although the research may be unsettling, what we do next is what matters most,"" Mr. Comey said.He said nearly all police officers had joined the force because they wanted to help others. Speaking in personal terms, Mr. Comey described how most Americans had initially viewed Irish immigrants like his ancestors ""as drunks, ruffians and criminals.""""Law enforcement's biased view of the Irish lives on in the nickname we still use for the vehicle that transports groups of prisoners; it is, after all, the 'Paddy wagon,' "" he said.But he said that what the Irish had gone through was nothing compared with what blacks had faced.""That experience should be part of every American's consciousness, and law enforcement's role in that experience, including in recent times, must be remembered,"" he said. ""It is our cultural inheritance.""Unlike Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and Mr. Holder, who were roundly faulted by police groups for their critical remarks about law enforcement, Mr. Comey, a former prosecutor whose grandfather was a police chief in Yonkers, was praised for his remarks.Ron Hosko, the president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund and a former senior F.B.I. official, said that while Mr. Holder's statements about policing and race after the Ferguson shooting had placed the blame directly on the police, Mr. Comey's remarks were far more nuanced and thoughtful.""He looked at all the sociological pieces,"" Mr. Hosko said. ""The director's comments were far more balanced, because it wasn't just heavy-handed on the cops.""Mr. Comey said that the police have received most of the blame in episodes like the Ferguson shooting and the death of an unarmed black man in Staten Island who was placed in a chokehold by an officer, but law enforcement in ""not the root cause of problems in our hardest-hit neighborhoods.""In many of those areas, blacks grow up ""in environments lacking role models, adequate education and decent employment,"" he said.Mr. Comey said tensions could be eased if the police got to know those they were charged to protect.""It's hard to hate up close,"" he said.He also recommended that law enforcement agencies be compelled, by legislation if necessary, to report shootings that involve police officers, and that those reports be recorded in an accessible database. When Mr. Brown was shot in Ferguson, Mr. Comey said, F.B.I. officials could not say whether such shootings were common or rare because no statistics were available.""It's ridiculous that I can't tell you how many people were shot by the police last week, last month, last year,"" Mr. Comey said.He added, ""Without complete and accurate data, we are left with ideological thunderbolts.""Ronald E. Teachman, the police chief in South Bend, Ind., said Mr. Comey did not need to take on the issue. But Chief Teachman said it would be far easier for him to continue the discussion in Indiana now that Mr. Comey had done so in such a public manner.""It helps me move the conversation forward when the F.B.I. director speaks so boldly,"" he said.Mr. Comey concluded by quoting Dr. King, who said, ""We must all learn to live together as brothers, or we will all perish together as fools.""""We all have work to do -- hard work to do, challenging work -- and it will take time,"" Mr. Comey said. ""We all need to talk, and we all need to listen, not just about easy things, but about hard things, too. Relationships are hard. Relationships require work. So let's begin. It is time to start seeing one another for who and what we really are.""Photograph James B. Comey of the F.B.I. (A1); James B.

"Despite Volkswagen Scandal, Europe's Diesel Habit Could Be Hard to Kick:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"LONDON -- A loyal Volkswagen owner for years, Jane Kelley was ""shocked,"" she says, by recent revelations that the German company had cheated on emissions tests in the United States.Snug in Ms. Kelley's garage in North London recently was a white 2013 Passat powered by a 2-liter diesel engine. The company says that as many as 11 million of its cars -- Volkswagens, Audis, Skodas and SEATs with diesel engines -- were equipped with software designed to fool emissions testers.But as disturbed as she was to learn that Volkswagen had cheated, Ms. Kelley does not necessarily want anything done about it. ""Are they going to take my car away and fiddle with the engine?"" she said with a worried tone, as she served tea in her sunlit dining room.As with at least some European diesel drivers, Ms. Kelley is in no hurry to abandon the car just because it may spew more noxious fumes than she originally thought. ""I do feel that it is a very safe car,"" she said. She also admires the acceleration of the turbocharged diesel, which she credits with helping her recently escape a potential hazard. ""There was a guy weaving, maybe drunk, so I just shot by,"" she recalled.Ms. Kelley is one of millions of fans of diesel cars across Europe, where fuel prices and taxes make the cost of filling an automobile's tank much higher than in the United States. Drawn by diesels' superior fuel economy over gasoline engines and the lower price of diesel fuel, European consumers have long leaned toward diesel cars -- a collective habit that might be difficult to break, despite the new scrutiny the Volkswagen scandal has given to diesel's dark side.While diesels have struggled in the United States to overcome a reputation as smoke-belching clunkers -- they represent about 3 percent of the American car market -- they have rolled to dominance across the Atlantic. Diesels accounted for more than half the new cars sold in Western Europe last year, compared with 14 percent in 1990.Europeans' embrace of diesels has encouraged manufacturers to improve the engines' performance, and it has motivated governments, especially those of Germany and France, to support their auto industries' diesel efforts. Although environmentalists have been sounding alarms for years, the forces propelling diesel were so strong that it might explain why drivers, carmakers and regulators have been willing at times to overlook diesels' tendency to be bigger polluters than gasoline cars.""Ban diesels? You can't be serious,"" Ségolène Royal, the French environment and energy minister, said recently, responding to a suggestion by a member of the Green Party. ""We can't treat problems of this gravity with ideological slogans at the expense of French interests,"" Ms. Royal said, noting that more than half the cars on French roads were diesels.In fact, the percentage in France is around 64 percent, even higher than in Germany, with French-made Renault, Peugeot and Citroën diesels joining Volkswagens on the road. There has been no indication that the French automakers cheated on emissions tests.So far, Volkswagen has not said how it plans to deal with the deceptive software problem, although the German government has set an Oct. 7 deadline for the company to propose a solution. Unlike in the United States, where lawyers are already recruiting car owners in hopes of filing class-action lawsuits, there is no similar tradition in Europe that would encourage consumers to collectively demand financial redress.Volkswagen said on Tuesday that it would prepare a plan by early October to improve the emissions of affected vehicles. Owners will be notified in the weeks and months after the plan has been approved by authorities, the company said.""If there is a recall, I would be happy if my car is not included in it,"" said Tony Novak, a retired editor for the BBC who lives in Reading, England. In Britain, just over half of new cars sold are diesels.""Diesels used to be terrible -- they used to be dirty and slow,"" he said. ""Now they are brilliant."" Mr. Novak had owned diesel cars previously, but when he bought his 2014 Volkswagen Golf diesel, ""I was really surprised by how good it was -- you really notice the difference in acceleration.""That Volkswagen might have achieved that performance by cheating -- it is still not clear whether the company needed the deceptive software to pass Europe's emissions tests, which are much less strict than the United States' -- is not what matters most to Mr. Novak. ""I worry that if they tweak the computer, the performance will deteriorate,"" he said.About five million of the affected cars are Golfs, Passats and other Volkswagen-brand cars. An additional two million are Audi brand cars, and the rest or Skoda and SEAT brand cars, or light commercial vehicles.Matthias Müller, a company insider who was appointed chief executive of Volkswagen last week, told top managers late Monday that the deceptive software was activated in only a portion of the 11 million vehicles that have the so-called EA 189 diesel motors. But Volkswagen did not specify how many cars were designed to cheat on emissions tests.Some industry experts say that the Volkswagen scandal could prove a turning point in the diesel love affair, if the new scrutiny of European emissions standards and testing makes it easier for the environmentalists to be heard.The premise of the ""clean diesel"" notion that Volkswagen promoted was partly based on the fact that on a per-mile basis, diesel engines emit less carbon dioxide -- a big contributor to climate change -- than gasoline engines. But diesel exhausts, unless cleaned in ways that Volkswagen's software was designed to sidestep, produce larger quantities of other harmful gases -- nitrogen oxides -- along with fine particles that contribute to stubbornly persistent air quality problems in European cities.""There is a recognition that, fundamentally, it is going to be difficult to control all of the problems with diesel -- smoke production is not going to go away,"" said Peter Wells, co-director of the center for automotive industry research at Cardiff Business School. ""In the very long term, diesel has had its day.""According to the European Environment Agency, which monitors air quality, 20 to 30 percent of urban residents in Europe are exposed to particle levels -- mainly from diesel exhaust fumes -- above those considered safe by the European Union, while about 10 percent are exposed to unsafe levels of nitrogen oxides.London and Paris have among the highest pollution levels in terms of nitrogen oxides. In March of this year and last, the smog in Paris reached such levels that the authorities were forced to temporarily limit the number of cars on the road each day.Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, which is playing host to the United Nations climate conference in November, is among those who have suggested an eventual ban on diesels in the city.The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, plans to establish an ultralow emissions zone in London by 2020 where older diesels will be penalized. A recent report by the environmental committee of the London Assembly, the city's legislature, said the mayor should consider banning all diesels from the zone.But environmental efforts must contend with deeply rooted diesel economics. Automotive fuel in Europe costs several times as much as in the United States, mainly because of higher taxes. The average price of gasoline in London in August, for example, was 521 pence, or about $7.92, per gallon. In most of Continental Europe, diesel sells for about 15 percent less than gasoline.Part of that difference is because the taxes that help keep fuel prices high are typically lower on diesel fuel.In Germany, the lower taxes on diesel fuel amount to an annual subsidy of 7 billion euros, or about $7.8 billion, for diesel owners, said Daniel Moser, a transportation analyst for the environmental group Greenpeace.""These policies are not in accordance with what we would have to do to protect the environment and people's health,"" he said.And then there are vehicle tax breaks that various governments offer to diesel owners, because of the cars' lower emissions of carbon dioxide.Also, new diesels are often only slightly more expensive than their gasoline counterparts. In Britain, a Volkswagen Golf Match with a 1.4-liter, turbocharged gasoline engine sells for £20,955, or about $31,800, while a similar model with a 1.6-liter diesel engine sells for £21,960, according to Carbuyer, a British website.With all those factors taken into account, owning and operating a diesel car in Europe is the more affordable way to go.In the United States, with much lower gasoline prices, ""there is no point at the margin, buying a diesel,"" said Garel Rhys, a professor emeritus at Cardiff University. He said Europeans' embrace of diesels made perfect sense. ""Essentially, growth came because consumers are economically rational individuals,"" Professor Rhys said.But a continued yen for diesels may not necessarily translate into an abiding love of Volkswagen, for some Europeans at least.Jon Devereux, who drives a diesel-engine Volkswagen Touareg, manages a hotel in Milford on Sea, in southern England. Each winter, he takes the four-wheel-drive vehicle to his winter home in the French Alps. The Touareg, he said, has ""been brilliant for 10 years.""But when it comes time to replace it, his next diesel will not be a Volkswagen. The emissions scandal has soured Mr. Devereux on the carmaker. ""Would you buy a VW car or any car in the VW group?"" he asked.",0.0
Emerging Clinton Team Shows Signs of Disquiet:   [National Desk ],,"Lingering tensions between Hillary Rodham Clinton's loyalists and the strategists who helped President Obama defeat her in 2008 have erupted into an intense public struggle over who will wield money and clout in her emerging 2016 presidential campaign.At issue is controlling access to the deep-pocketed donors whose support is critical to sustain the outside organizations that are paving the way for Mrs. Clinton's campaign. It is a competition that has been exacerbated, many Clinton supporters said, by Mrs. Clinton's reluctance to formally enter the race and establish a campaign organization with clear lines of authority.The dispute broke into the open on Monday after David Brock, a Clinton ally, accused Priorities USA Action -- a pro-Clinton ""super PAC"" whose co-chairman is Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's 2012 campaign manager -- of planting negative stories about the fund-raising practices of Mr. Brock's organizations. Mr. Brock resigned from the super PAC's board in protest.Mr. Messina is one of the half-dozen top veterans of Mr. Obama's campaigns that Mrs. Clinton's tightknit circle of advisers has hired or courted, vexing some longtime Clintonites seeking more prominent roles for themselves. Other former Obama aides are working with pro-Clinton groups to organize grass-roots volunteers or to fend off attacks on her record, efforts that some Democrats view as the first step toward a place in Mrs. Clinton's campaign when it finally gets off the ground.All recognize that Mrs. Clinton's political operation could dominate the Democratic Party for the next decade, controlling the flow of commissions, consulting work and political appointments. But the marriage between the two camps -- based to a large degree on mutual interest, if not love -- now appears more uneasy than at any time since Mr. Obama asked Mrs. Clinton to serve in his administration after the 2008 election.""It is 'The Dream Team,' but only five can start,"" said John Morgan, a Florida lawyer who has raised money for Mr. Obama and hosted fund-raisers with former President Bill Clinton. ""Who do you put at guard? Jordan, LeBron, Kobe, Magic, Bird, Derrick Rose? That is where it is.""The list of Obama veterans now working in ""Clinton World"" includes the New York-based pollster Joel Benenson, whom Mrs. Clinton has settled on as chief strategist over several pollsters with long Clinton ties. A consulting firm founded by two Obama voter-turnout specialists, Mitch Stewart and Jeremy Bird, is being paid $20,000 a month by Ready for Hillary, a super PAC focused on organizing grass-roots Clinton supporters. Jim Margolis, whose firm handled lucrative media-buying contracts for Mr. Obama's campaigns, will also advise Mrs. Clinton, whose campaign will probably raise and spend over a billion dollars in the next two years.But Mr. Brock's path to the Clinton inner circle is perhaps the most convoluted. Once a conservative journalist whose reporting on President Clinton prompted Paula Jones's 1994 sexual harassment lawsuit against him, Mr. Brock has since emerged as a prominent liberal organizer and one of Mrs. Clinton's chief defenders.With the tacit blessing of both Clintons, Mr. Brock has maneuvered his $28 million network of media-monitoring and opposition research organizations into the center of the emerging Clinton effort, establishing a new project, Correct the Record, that has defended Mrs. Clinton in the news media and even issued daily emails explaining her positions.His successful fund-raising has been led by Mary Pat Bonner, whose firm has been paid millions of dollars by Mr. Brock's groups to court donors -- some of whom have criticized the arrangement as well as Mr. Brock.""He is a cancer,"" said Mr. Morgan, who is close to Mr. Messina.""If you care about your party and our country, you just do what you are asked,"" said Mr. Morgan, referring to Mr. Brock's public resignation from Priorities USA, which immediately reignited tales of infighting from Mrs. Clinton's 2008 campaign. ""If you care about yourself, you take your toys and go home.""Mr. Brock declined to comment.Susie Tompkins Buell, a friend of Mrs. Clinton's and a donor from San Francisco who is close to Mr. Brock, said he ""is an incredibly important part of the Democratic Party"" whose work ""protects us from the onslaught and destruction of the Republican attack machine.""Ms. Buell added: ""Certain people are trying to destroy David through off-the-record conversations with reporters. They are spineless and devious.""Mr. Messina, now a consultant with a significant roster of corporate and political clients, became co-chairman of Priorities early last year, charged with helping the advertising-oriented super PAC secure hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions. But with the campaign season still a year away, Mr. Messina and his team have encountered some difficulty getting commitments, according to several Democrats involved in helping the group.Mr. Brock, in turn, has been reluctant to cede turf -- or pre-eminence -- to Obama veterans like Mr. Messina. ""He was never accepted"" by the Obama camp, said one Clinton loyalist, who like most people interviewed for this article declined to speak on the record for fear of angering either the president or the woman who hopes to replace him.Months ago, Mrs. Clinton's top advisers encouraged the three pro-Clinton super PACs -- Ready for Hillary, Priorities USA and Mr. Brock's American Bridge 21st Century -- to combine efforts. Mr. Brock's organization would provide opposition research to Priorities, which would eventually raise high-dollar donations to pay for attack ads. Ready for Hillary would dissolve after Mrs. Clinton officially declared her candidacy.But Priorities is the only one of the groups founded by Obama operatives, making it the least easiest to fit into the emerging Clinton apparatus. And all outside groups are facing increased competition from official party organizations, like the Democratic National Committee, which are now free to solicit their own million-dollar commitments from big donors, thanks to new campaign finance rules inserted into December's federal spending bill.In a statement, Mr. Messina suggested there was little tension with Mr. Brock or his organizations. ""Priorities USA Action works closely and cooperatively with progressive champion David Brock and American Bridge,"" he said. ""Both organizations have clear and complementary missions, and we look forward to continuing to work together to build on our shared success.""Several donors approached by Priorities in recent months, including some advised by Ms. Bonner, said they had already given generously or otherwise committed to Mr. Brock. Mr. Messina's allies worry that Clinton loyalists will seek to replace him with another strategist closer to Mrs. Clinton, perhaps Guy Cecil, previously a contender for the job of Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager.When the Priorities board issued a statement on Monday evening asking Mr. Brock to reconsider his resignation, it was signed not by Mr. Messina but by his co-chairwoman, Jennifer M. Granholm, the former Michigan governor and a Clinton supporter in 2008. Ms. Granholm and other Priorities officials have sought to soothe Mr. Brock, Democrats assisting the group said, and he has suggested he would be open to rejoining the super PAC's board.In an interview, Mr. Messina denied a report in BuzzFeed that he had used the controversy around Ms. Bonner's fees to try to rally donors around a pledge to hold back checks from any organizations paying fund-raisers on commission. Such a campaign could cripple Mr. Brock's groups, which rely entirely on Ms. Bonner's firm to raise money.""I've never heard of a petition, I don't know anything about it, no one has talked to me,"" Mr. Messina said. ""It's not true.""",0.0

Sober Goes Social:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"Is there anything that would make someone want to join a new social network at this point? We already have Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as well as smaller alternatives like Ello. And the advent of apps like Snapchat has made public blabbing less appealing than engaging in private communication.But Beau Mann, the chief executive and a founder of a new app called Sober Grid, says that for some users, joining this social network could be a matter of life and death. ""It sounds somewhat dramatic, but it's realistic,"" Mr. Mann said. ""Some people, their life is dependent on their sobriety. So that need to connect is how people get and maintain sobriety.""Sober Grid is for those who are battling addiction. It has a public news feed where users can post messages about their struggles and successes with sobriety, a grid of photos of potential ""sober friends,"" a messaging platform and other features that will be familiar to users of Facebook and other networking platforms. It can be used anonymously, though many users include first names and photos.The photos of potential friends can make Sober Grid seem like a dating app for teetotalers, an impression Mr. Mann would like to discourage. He hopes it will appeal to a broader group.""There's lots of sober people that are married, and if it's a dating app, they won't be able to go on there and get the support that they need,"" he said.Sober Grid was launched in New York on July 9 and has grown quickly. Around 5 percent of those who have signed up have opted to pay $39.99 a year for a premium membership, which permits posting four additional profile photos and visiting in ""stealth mode"" to guard anonymity.Sober Grid can be a bit clunky to use, and the purpose of some of its sections is difficult to discern. No explanation is provided within the app, for instance, for a blank ""visitors"" tab. (It keeps track of users who have looked at your profile, unless they have done so in stealth mode.)Even features within the app's main section, the grid, can be confusing. There is a ""burning desire"" button geared toward users worried about falling off the wagon and seeking the intervention of others. But Mr. Mann said many users did not understand the button's purpose. (Posting a message to the news feed appears to be the most effective way to attract help in a hurry.)Some may worry that building a network specifically for sober users will only add to the stigma they feel over being in recovery, and that people trying to beat addiction need not isolate themselves with a separate app. Mr. Mann, himself a recovering addict, described that notion as unrealistic.""We definitely want to get to the point where there's no stigma,"" he said. ""But that's not the reality right now.

Parliament of Kosovo Votes to Amend Constitution to Allow for War Crimes Court:   [Foreign Desk ],,"LONDON -- The Kosovo Parliament has amended the country's Constitution to allow for the creation of a war crimes court, which is expected to try ethnic Albanians accused of war crimes.The move is viewed by many world powers, including the United States and the European Union, as a vital prerequisite for regional reconciliation in the aftermath of the bloody Balkan wars of the 1990s.The 120-seat Parliament approved the constitutional changes by a vote of 82 to 5 on Monday, Petrit Selimi, the deputy foreign minister, said in a phone interview on Tuesday. The vote is a milestone in Kosovo, where opposition to the creation of the court has been robust.The court, which is to be made up of international judges and based in The Hague, is expected to hear war crimes cases, including accusations of organ harvesting committed against Serbs. Ethnic Albanians who oppose the court contend that it threatens to unfairly challenge the longstanding view of the 1998-99 Kosovo war and turn victims into perpetrators. Opposition politicians boycotted the vote.Ramush Haradinaj, a former guerrilla leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army and former prime minister of Kosovo who now leads the opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, said the court would be detrimental to the country's image. ""By approving this court, we are turning ourselves into a monster,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""During the war, we were not monsters; we were victims.""Prosecutors in Serbia are investigating Mr. Haradinaj on war crimes allegations; he has rejected the accusations.But Mr. Selimi hailed the vote as ""overwhelming"" despite the loud opposition in Parliament, and said: ""The creation of the court is a necessary tool for Kosovars for the truth about our war for freedom. Perpetrators can never be equal with victims. Our war for freedom was not equal to Milosevic's drive for genocide.""Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on Feb. 17, 2008, almost a decade after NATO bombs helped push out Slobodan Milosevic, the former leader of Serbia, ending a brutal civil war against the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo. But attempts to come to terms with the past on both sides have been undermined by accusations that leading members of the Kosovo Liberation Army have evaded justice.Marko Djuric, the director of the Serbian government's Office for Kosovo, was quoted as saying by B92, an independent Serbian broadcaster, that the vote by Parliament was only a first step. ""We cannot be satisfied until those who have committed crimes have been punished,"" he said.In July 2014, Clint Williamson, an American diplomat who led a special European Union task force charged with investigating war crimes, said senior members of the Kosovo Liberation Army engaged in a campaign of persecution against ethnic Serbs after the 1998-99 Kosovo war.He said senior officials of the guerrilla group had intentionally targeted minority populations with acts of persecution that included ""unlawful killings, abductions, enforced disappearances, illegal detentions in camps in Kosovo and Albania, sexual violence, other forms of inhumane treatment, forced displacements of individuals from their homes and communities, and desecration and destruction of churches and other religious sites.""He said the evidence suggested that the guerrilla group had targeted people after the war to harvest and sell their organs.The task force was set up in September 2011 after a Council of Europe report accused Kosovo's former prime minister, Hashim Thaci -- the former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who is now the country's foreign minister -- of having led a group that smuggled human organs, weapons and heroin during and after the war.Mr. Thaci has denied the accusations.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

Review: 'What Nerve!' Presents an Alternative History of American Art:   [Review ],,"'WHAT NERVE!''Alternative Figures in American Art, 1960 to the Present'Matthew Marks Gallery502, 522 and 526 West 22nd Street, ChelseaThrough next FridayThis lavish, thrillingly revisionist show challenges the bias of postwar American art history in favor of New York, abstraction and Conceptual art. It presents the core of an earlier, larger version shown last fall at the Rhode Island School of Design Museum in Providence, also titled ""What Nerve! Alternative Figures in American Art, 1960 to the Present."" It has been reconfigured here by one of its curators, Dan Nadel, an expert on underground comics and postwar figurative art from beyond New York. Mr. Nadel seems to know where to find the best stuff in terms of unfamiliar pieces and fascinating ephemera.This show centers on two caches of works from the 1960s. One is the Pop-Surreal, comics-influenced efforts of Jim Nutt, Art Green, Suellen Rocca, Karl Wirsum, Jim Falconer and Gladys Nilsson, who led Chicago's Hairy Who movement with antic works painted on plexiglass, lawn chairs or canvas. They are joined by the messier idiosyncrasies of California Funk artists like the ceramist sculptors Ken Price and Robert Arneson and the painters Peter Saul and Roy De Forest, among others.Mr. Nadel places their often irreverent creations in a continuum with Destroy All Monsters, a Michigan punk band that included Mike Kelley and Jim Shaw and whose members are represented here by drawings, photographs and copies and page mock-ups for the band's magazine. It concludes with Forcefield, a collective from Providence that was featured in the 2002 Whitney Biennial. Consisting of Mat Brinkman, Jim Drain, Leif Goldberg and Ara Peterson, Forcefield specialized in anarchic music and videos, silkscreens and, most memorably, brightly knit head-to-toe body suits whose patterns zigzag suggestively from the primitive to the digital.Of the show's two main galleries, one is installed with typical Marksian spaciousness. The other reflects Mr. Nadel's omnivorous interests. Sadly, several important outliers in the first show have been eliminated: H. C. Westermann, William N. Copley, Gary Panter, Christina Ramberg, the superhero comic artist Jack Kirby and Elizabeth Murray, a New York painter from Chicago indebted to the Hairy Who.But this show, along with the excellent catalog for its original iteration, still teems with ideas that other curators should build on.Photograph Installation View at Matthew Marks's 522 West 22nd Street Gallery.

Substantiated Complaints About Police Use of Chokeholds Increase:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"Last year, a police oversight board substantiated six complaints by people who said New York City officers had restrained them with a chokehold, a banned maneuver that was used by an officer in the fatal encounter with Eric Garner on Staten Island in July.The number, while small, is a notable increase. From 2009 to 2013, the oversight agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, substantiated a total of nine chokehold complaints.The rise in verified chokeholds underscores a fact, tacitly acknowledged by police officials, that the move is used more than has been publicly known.All but one of the six complaints -- which came from encounters in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Upper Manhattan -- were substantiated after the death of Mr. Garner. Last month, the board substantiated a seventh chokehold complaint.In most substantiated chokehold cases, the review board has recommended that the police commissioner, who has final say, impose the stiffest form of departmental discipline, which can include suspension or termination. The board did so in five of the cases in 2014. But rather than severely penalizing officers who violate the ban, the Police Department has in recent years meted out little or no punishment.In the aftermath of Mr. Garner's death, top police officials are debating whether to go further and alter the ban to formally allow chokeholds in life-or-death situations.At the same time, top officials are strongly considering eliminating the term ""chokehold"" from The Patrol Guide, the department's internal rulebook, and replacing it with any ""pressure on the neck,"" said a police official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the discussions, over a variety of use-of-force policies, had yet to reach any conclusion.""It was a poor choice of words when we put it out in 1993,"" the official said. ""It did not capture all the dangerous restraints around the neck."" Whether to adopt an exemption for cases where deadly force would be justified has yet to be presented to Commissioner William J. Bratton for a final decision.The number of chokehold complaints filed with the board has remained relatively steady, with 222 last year compared with 179 in 2013 (and two substantiated) and 240 complaints in 2009 (and three substantiated). With little change in the number of complaints, the increase in those substantiated in 2014 pointed to changes in how the board evaluated such complaints under the leadership of Richard D. Emery, who was appointed as chairman on July 17.""These new figures suggest that chokeholds have been an even more serious problem than we realized,"" said Christopher T. Dunn, the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.In a report after Mr. Garner's death, Mr. Emery said both the Police Department and the review board's investigators had loosened their interpretation of the ban over time, changing the definition of a chokehold from force that may restrict breathing to a hold that actually did. The report found that, as a result, investigators missed some allegations of chokeholds and that even when it substantiated them, the department rarely imposed discipline.Mr. Emery, who will convene a monthly board meeting on Wednesday, was traveling abroad and did not immediately return a call and an email seeking comment on Tuesday.Mr. Garner's death brought new scrutiny on the use of chokeholds, from Police Headquarters, the review board and the city's new police inspector general.Though the use of chokeholds by officers is banned by department policy, there is no law prohibiting it. A bill before the City Council, opposed by the mayor, would make the maneuver illegal.Most of the seven substantiated cases involved complaints that were lodged before Mr. Bratton took over as commissioner last year.In one possibility being explored by officials, chokeholds could be taught at the Police Academy and officers who use one against a suspect would have their actions reviewed, much like what happens after a police shooting.The data on substantiated chokehold allegations comes from the review board's monthly reports, which are stripped of all information about the officers involved besides their assigned precinct or the circumstances that led to the chokehold.A spokeswoman for the board declined to comment or divulge details about the substantiated complaints or the officers involved, citing a frequently invoked clause in state law, Section 50-a of the Civil Rights Law, that protects the privacy of officers' personnel records. Freedom of information advocates are lobbying the State Legislature to amend or repeal that section.In 2014, the board fully investigated 127 allegations of an officer using a chokehold, up from 88 the year before and a similar number in 2011. (The agency's ability to take complaints in 2012 was affected by Hurricane Sandy.)Most substantiated cases eventually wind their way to the department's trial room, in proceedings that are open to the public but whose transcripts have been kept secret by the city, which has cited the Civil Rights Law.Mr. Bratton has said he would seek to speed the process, which has in the past taken years before a substantiated complaint reaches the commissioner's desk.Only one case, substantiated before he took over, has been decided during Mr. Bratton's tenure: A plainclothes officer in Queens was found not guilty of using a chokehold during a struggle with a bicyclist.",0.0
"Artists Take On the Music Industry, Calling for Change:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"Musicians are known for speaking out on issues like human rights, politics and the environment. They are less known for speaking out about how the music business itself should operate.That may be changing.When Taylor Swift publicly rebuked Apple in June over royalty payments, the company reversed its position and Ms. Swift's move was celebrated throughout the music world as a victory. But it was only the most prominent example of a growing trend of industry-focused activism undertaken by a range of artists, from big stars who take a principled stand to middle-class musicians who need to worry about paying the bills.""We're at a turning point,"" said the singer David Byrne, formerly of Talking Heads, who has been vocal on the economics behind digital music. ""Musicians, their managers and many others are frustrated. The black box of hidden transactions in the music business, while maybe not illegal, is a recipe for chicanery.""The activism has taken different shapes. Jay Z, for example, paid $56 million for the subscription streaming service Tidal, though his efforts to market it as an artist-friendly alternative have been criticized as clumsy. Prince, Neil Young and Ms. Swift have withdrawn their music from some streaming outlets, and various musicians have called for greater transparency in how the music industry operates.Over the last few weeks, dozens of acts, including R.E.M., Common and Chuck D of Public Enemy, took to social media to support a bill that would require radio stations to pay royalties to performers.The debate has been enabled by social media and reflects changes in many artists' attitudes toward the online economy over the last 15 years or so -- a period that stretches from the rise of Napster and iTunes to online streaming outlets like YouTube, Pandora and Spotify, and has been accompanied by enormous changes in how money flows through the industry.""The support that we're seeing, in terms of the range and number of artists, whether it's from somebody who's a working-class musician to somebody who's very successful, it's unprecedented,"" said Ted Kalo, the executive director of MusicFirst, a lobbying coalition that includes record labels and musicians' groups and that helped organize the social media campaign.The economics behind downloads is relatively simple: Typically about 70 percent of a song's retail price goes to a record company, which then pays its musicians according to its contracts. But with streaming, the system is complex and often opaque, as became apparent in May, when an outdated licensing contract between Sony and Spotify was leaked online, showing the elaborate formulas used in computing streaming rates.Public relations missteps in the early 2000s kept many musicians from speaking out about economic issues, artists and executives said. Those include the music industry's lawsuits against thousands of fans for online file-sharing, and the pillorying that the band Metallica received after it sued Napster for copyright infringement. But the shift toward streaming in recent years has prompted many musicians to investigate the changes in the business and comment online. Among them are independents like David Lowery of the band Cracker; Zoë Keating, a cellist who has documented her online royalties; and Blake Morgan, a singer-songwriter who owns a small record company and started an online campaign, #IRespectMusic, to draw attention to the issue.At the same time, musicians and songwriters of all stripes have begun to complain, often bitterly, of low royalty payments from streaming music. Last year, for example, Bette Midler spoke out against Pandora and Spotify, and Aloe Blacc said that he earned just $4,000 in songwriting royalties from 168 million streams on Pandora of Avicii's hit ""Wake Me Up,"" which Mr. Blacc helped write.In response, many streaming outlets point out that their actions are a legal and rapidly growing source of income for the industry as sales of CDs and downloads plunge. Pandora says it has paid nearly $1.5 billion in royalties since it started a decade ago, and Spotify, which went online in 2008, says it has paid $3 billion. Yet how much of that money makes its way into musicians' pockets remains hotly debated.Melvin Gibbs, a jazz bassist in New York who is the president of the Content Creators Coalition, said that declining royalties -- he recalled once getting a check for 3 cents -- were a factor that led him to study the business models of Internet companies that offer abundant music free or at low subscription prices.""None of these companies that are supposedly in the music business are actually in the music business,"" Mr. Gibbs said. ""They are in the data-aggregation business. They're in the ad-selling business. The value of music means nothing to them.""Several years ago Ms. Keating, who controls her own recordings, began posting detailed royalty statements from Spotify, and she has also reported on private negotiations with YouTube in which that company appeared to pressure her into signing a contract for its new music-subscription service.Despite growing complaints from middle-class musicians, it is still the stars who have the most impact. As Apple prepared last month to release its new streaming service, Apple Music, independent labels around the world said that the company's refusal to pay royalties for trial streams was unfair. But Apple did not budge until Ms. Swift scolded the company in a blog post -- whereupon Apple changed course in a matter of hours.Lobbying has become another battleground. In April, the Fair Play Fair Pay Act was introduced to Congress, which would require AM and FM radio stations to pay royalties to performers, in addition to songwriters. The bill has been hailed by musicians and opposed by broadcasters, who have long argued that by playing a song on air they give it valuable promotion.But a side controversy has emerged over the MIC Coalition, a Washington advocacy group that includes Pandora, the National Association of Broadcasters and others that have frequently opposed the music industry over royalty matters. In June, Amazon withdrew its membership, and a senior executive told Billboard magazine that the company's primary interest in transparency was ""getting lost in the wilder noise surrounding rate-setting.""Two weeks ago, National Public Radio also dropped out of the coalition after complaints from the Content Creators Coalition, which accused it of ""working in Washington to deny fair pay to the very artists it purports to celebrate on their air.""A spokeswoman for the MIC Coalition -- whose name stands for Music, Innovation, Consumers -- said that the group had not taken a position on the Fair Play act, though many of its members had as individuals. Michael Riksen, NPR's vice president for policy and representation, declined to say why the organization had left the MIC Coalition. But he said that he ""viewed the coalition as a way for the voice and values of public radio and NPR to be part of a broad-based conversation about copyright reform.""""Had it taken a position"" on the bill, Mr. Riksen added, ""we wouldn't have joined in the first place.""The political chances are also unclear for the Fair Play bill, whose other provisions include paying royalties to artists for recordings made before 1972, which are not covered by federal copyright. Similar efforts have failed in the past, and the National Association of Broadcasters says that 203 members of the House and 19 senators have signed a nonbinding resolution opposing it.Still, Mr. Byrne and other musicians pushing for the bill say they are undeterred.""This one can be won, then we can move on to the harder ones,"" Mr. Byrne said. ""Why this time? Can't point to anything specific. It feels right, and as musicians that's what often drives us.""Photograph Melvin Gibbs, a Jazz Bassist, Is the President of the Content Creators Coalition.

Final Motorcyclist Sentenced in '13 Assault on S.U.V. Driver:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"A state judge sentenced the last of the motorcyclists convicted of attacking a driver in Upper Manhattan to three and a half years in prison on Thursday after the defendant gave a tearful apology in court.The defendant, Robert Sims, 37, a Brooklyn electrician, said he had lost control when he and several other bikers dragged Alexian Lien from his Range Rover on 178th Street near Wadsworth Avenue and beat him in front of his wife, Rosalyn Ng, and their 2-year-old daughter.The attack took place during a raucous motorcycle rally on Sept. 29, 2013. The bikers became enraged because Mr. Lien, whose sport utility vehicle they had blocked off on the Henry Hudson Parkway, ran over one of them while trying to flee.""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" Mr. Sims said, beginning to weep. ""'I'm sorry' isn't enough.""""I never intended to hurt anybody,"" he went on. ""I folded under pressure, under emotion and I'm sorry. Six seconds of losing my composure.

He said Mr. Sims and the other bikers, including an undercover detective, had turned into an angry mob.

Judge Defies Gay Marriage Law:   [National Desk ],,"TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- In a dramatic show of defiance toward the federal judiciary, Chief Justice Roy S. Moore of the Alabama Supreme Court on Sunday night ordered the state's probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to gay couples on Monday, the day same-sex marriages were expected to begin here.""Effective immediately, no probate judge of the State of Alabama nor any agent or employee of any Alabama probate judge shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent"" with the Alabama Constitution or state law, the chief justice wrote in his order.The order, coming just hours before the January decisions of United States District Court Judge Callie V. S. Granade were scheduled to take effect, was almost certainly going to thrust this state into legal turmoil. It was not immediately clear how the state's 68 probate judges, who, like Chief Justice Moore, are popularly elected, would respond to the order.Since Judge Granade moved last month to declare Alabama's prohibitions against same-sex marriage unconstitutional, the chief justice has insisted that the probate judges were not required to abide by her decisions. But, in an interview on Wednesday, he said he thought he could do little more than guide the probate judges on how to respond.""I think I've done what I can do: advise the state court probate judges that they're not bound by any ruling of the Federal District Court,"" he said.But by Sunday night, the chief justice, faced with the prospect of many judges allowing same-sex marriages to move forward, acted, in part, ""to ensure the orderly administration of justice within the State of Alabama.""Reached by telephone late Sunday night, Ben Cooper, chairman of the board of the gay rights group Equality Alabama, said that same-sex couples expected to be issued marriage licenses Monday morning.""We are continuing to move forward tomorrow,"" Mr. Cooper said. ""If we walk in and licenses are refused, if they do not comply with the federal order, then these probate judges could be personally liable,"" said Mr. Cooper, who added that he expected legal actions to be filed against the individual probate judges if they do not issue the licenses.Some judges across the state had already signaled they would do nothing to aid gay couples and, in some instances, any couples. ""Marriage licenses and ceremonies are no longer available at the Pike County Probate Office,"" the office said.And Washington County Probate Judge Nick Williams released a ""declaration in support of marriage"" in which he said he would ""only issue marriage licenses and solemnize ceremonies consistent with Alabama law and the U.S. Constitution; namely, between one man and one woman only, so help me God.""Several judges elsewhere announced variations of those plans after a push by Chief Justice Moore, who rose to national prominence in the early 2000s when he defied a federal judge's order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from a Montgomery building and was subsequently ousted from his post leading the high court. He staged a political comeback, became chief justice again in 2013, and has in recent weeks said that Alabama's probate judges are not bound by a federal trial court's decisions. His argument has deep resonance in a place where a governor, George Wallace, stood in a doorway of the University of Alabama in 1963 in an unsuccessful bid to block its federally ordered integration.Although much has changed from Wallace's era, Chief Justice Moore had used a series of strongly worded letters and memorandums to insist that Judge Granade, an appointee of President George W. Bush who joined the federal bench in 2002, had instigated a grave breach of law.The result had been a legal and cultural debate rife with overtones of history, closely held religious beliefs and a chronically bubbling mistrust of the federal government that was expected to play out at Alabama's courthouses Monday.""I didn't start this,"" Chief Justice Moore said last week of the controversy. ""This was a federal court case pushed on our state.""Judge Granade has signaled that she expects probate judges to carry out her decisions, and judges, before the chief justice's order, had often said they would.""With all due respect to Chief Justice Moore, he's on the Alabama Supreme Court, and he's not a federal judge,"" said Alan L. King, a probate judge in Jefferson County, said last week.The chief justice's misgivings speak to widespread concerns here about federal overreach and same-sex marriage in Alabama, where about 81 percent of voters in 2006 supported a constitutional amendment banning gay nuptials. Few here doubt the force of his belief that Judge Granade's orders hold only ""persuasive authority,"" and not binding power, on Alabama judges.""My guess is that is actually the way Roy Moore sincerely understands the federal-state relationship,"" said Joseph Smith, a judicial politics expert at the University of Alabama. ""He's also an elected politician, and he knows who his constituency is.""So he has for now turned his words against Judge Granade.""She can't order them to recognize the unconstitutionality of the Sanctity of Marriage Amendment by her views,"" the chief justice said in a telephone interview during which he quoted Alabama statutes verbatim and resisted comparisons to Wallace.Despite Chief Justice Moore's protests, some analysts see parallels between his arguments now and those Wallace advanced in his own time.""It's a very similar strain of ideology: the state's rights, resisting the national tide, resisting liberal movements in policy,"" Dr. Smith said.Some legal scholars say that the chief justice may be correct in his interpretation of the immediate scope of the federal court's rulings and how they apply to the probate judges. But his eagerness in pronouncing his views unnerved some in Alabama who feared that it might stir local judges to resist Judge Granade.""I don't want to see judges make the same mistakes that I think were made in this state 50 years ago, where you have state officials not abiding by federal orders,"" said Judge Steven L. Reed of Montgomery County, who added, ""The legacy always hangs over us until we show that we're beyond it.""But there had been only limited talk of plans for sweeping defiance by probate judges, including those who say that same-sex marriages conflict with their religious views. In Geneva County, Judge Fred Hamic said Wednesday he would issue licenses to gay couples but that they would have to go somewhere else to wed. ""I believe I would be partaking in a sin, and I sin every day, don't get me wrong,"" he said. ""This is one sin I do not have to participate in, not that you have to participate in any sin.""For many here, it is unsurprising that Chief Justice Moore emerged as a strident voice in a social debate after the dispute about the Ten Commandments display, known as ""Roy's Rock,"" forced him from power.""Unfortunately, sometimes it makes for very good politics here to be seen as opposing federal intervention, whether it's from a court or a federal agency,"" said David G. Kennedy, who represents two women involved in a case that prompted Judge Granade's decision. ""The situation here is that this is not federal intervention. It's not federal intervention at all. What it is, is a federal court declaring what same-sex couples' rights are under the federal Constitution.""",0.0
"European Leaders Debate Aid to Ukraine, but Not Russia's Transgressions:   [Editorial ]",,"MUNICH -- It was at the venerable Munich Security Conference in 2007 that Vladimir Putin first sounded the resentful Cold War blast that now defines his foreign policy, bitterly accusing the United States of seeking a monopoly on global power. Subsequent Munich conferences were marked by desultory efforts to ""reset"" the relationship, to maintain the appearance at least of collegiality. All that was before Ukraine.At the security conference this past weekend in a bitterly cold Bavarian capital, the talk in the hall packed with generals, defense ministers, lawmakers and senior politicians was not of Russia's place in a European security order. It was about whether to send lethal arms to Ukraine to counter the military assistance that Russia supplies -- and blandly denies supplying -- to rebels in the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.Although the deterioration in relations with Russia has been obvious for some time, the hostility on display in Munich was still striking, even shocking, to many Russia hands and veterans of such conferences. One Russian participant said she got chills listening to some of the speeches.States bordering on Russia were referred to as ""front-line states."" The familiar litany of self-pity and it's-all-Washington's-doing from Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov -- once a friend to many in the hall -- drew bursts of derisive laughter. And when a Russian legislator regarded as pro-Western tried to argue that Western views of Ukraine were superficial, Senator Lindsey Graham, who with Senators John McCain and Bob Corker was part of a chorus of hawkish Republican lawmakers at the conference -- brusquely dismissed his comments.This was the stormy background against which Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, opened what many see as an 11th-hour effort to negotiate an end to the fighting in Ukraine. Perhaps more important for her, she was also trying to forestall growing calls in the United States to start supplying defensive but lethal arms to Ukraine.""The progress that Ukraine needs cannot be achieved by more weapons,"" Ms. Merkel said again and again at the Munich conference. It is also the message she pressed during her visit to Washington on Monday.Ms. Merkel addressed the security conference on Saturday, the day after she and President François Hollande of France, her partner in the negotiating initiative, had held talks in Kiev and Moscow. They and the leaders of Russia and Ukraine are tentatively scheduled to meet next in Minsk on Wednesday for what is expected to be the decisive moment of their current mission.Details of what's on the table are not known, and Ms. Merkel acknowledged that success was far from certain. But Senator Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, was not particularly receptive in his response: The chancellor, he said, was blocking America from giving Ukraine the arms it needs.That is not the position of President Obama, and Secretary of State John Kerry fervently sought to persuade the conference that ""there is no division, there is no split"" between the United States and Germany on how to deal with Russia over Ukraine. Mr. Obama repeated that formulation on Monday after meeting with Ms. Merkel at the White House, but pointedly left the idea of lethal assistance on the table.The United States is currently committed to provide training and nonlethal equipment (body armor and the like), and Mr. Obama has not shown enthusiasm for providing the communications equipment and arms to counter Russian artillery and radar that President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine is seeking.The debate, however, which continued in the corridors and beer halls, goes beyond Ukraine's military needs. On the eve of the meeting, a group of former ambassadors to NATO and Ukraine issued a report declaring that Ukraine represented the most serious security threat to the West since the Cold War. The West had to be prepared to send lethal assistance to Ukraine, they argued, both ""to support Ukraine and to push back against Russia's unacceptable challenge to the postwar European security order.""Ms. Merkel's deeply held counterargument, based on her roots in East Germany, is that East-West conflicts cannot be resolved militarily, and that if one negotiating approach fails, then another must be tried.A more pragmatic argument against lethal assistance is that Ukraine and its military, in their utterly devastated state, are in no shape to deploy sophisticated weapons. A stronger argument is that Mr. Putin would actually welcome an escalation since it would confirm his claim that the United States is pulling Kiev's strings, and since his army could easily overcome any increase in Ukrainian military capability.These debates will not be resolved anytime soon. But, however sore Mr. Lavrov may be at his drubbing in Munich, he would do his country a favor by reporting to his president that there was no debate in Munich this time about how Mr. Putin and his aggressive policies are perceived in the West.Graph Graphic",0.0
Congress Rethinks the Cuba Embargo:   [Editorial ],,"In 1962, the year Bob Dylan released his first album, Marilyn Monroe died of an overdose and Nelson Mandela was imprisoned, the American government began imposing an economic embargo on Cuba in an effort to subvert Fidel Castro.Over the decades, American presidents and lawmakers have stiffened and at times loosened the embargo. Yet, the web of laws and regulations enacted in a failed attempt to change the regime in Havana through coercive means remains largely frozen in time.With the United States and Cuba restoring diplomatic relations, a significant majority of Americans and an overwhelming majority of Cubans want the embargo repealed. It is time for Congress to help make engagement the cornerstone of American policy toward Cuba.A growing number of lawmakers from both parties have taken promising steps in that direction in recent weeks. Representatives Tom Emmer, Republican of Minnesota, and Kathy Castor, Democrat of Florida, introduced a bill in the House last week that would lift the embargo. Earlier last month, the Senate Appropriations Committee passed amendments that would allow American citizens to travel to Cuba freely and ease some commercial interactions.""The embargo has benefited the Castro regime and hurt the Cuban people,"" said Representative Emmer. ""We've given it plenty of time.""Despite the executive actions the Obama administration has taken, Cuba continues to face some of the stiffest American sanctions. It is the only country United States citizens are barred from visiting as tourists. The chief executive of Marriott International, Arne Sorenson, who recently visited Cuba for the first time, is among those arguing that the embargo is putting American companies at an unreasonable disadvantage. Foreign businesses are rushing to get a foothold in the Cuban market ""to leave as little as possible for American business when the restrictions are lifted altogether,"" Mr. Sorenson said in a statement.Spurred by the same concern, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced a bill in February that would allow regular commerce with Cuba. ""What is going to happen is Americans are going to flock to Cuba, they're going to be staying in Spanish hotels, eating German food and using Chinese computers,"" she said.For years, Cuban-American lawmakers, who continue to champion the embargo, have dominated policy toward Cuba. Historically, other politicians largely deferred to them because many were less invested in the issue and some feared that taking an anti-embargo position would alienate Cuban-American voters.Any lawmaker who remains on the fence on the matter should consider the dramatic change in public opinion. A Pew Research Center poll released on July 21 showed that 72 percent of Americans support ending the embargo against Cuba, up from 66 percent in January. While Democrats support President Obama's effort to normalize relations with Cuba by a wider margin than Republicans, support among the latter is rising. The survey found that 55 percent of conservative Republicans favor ending the embargo, up from 40 percent in January.Two leading Republican presidential candidates, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, have been critical of Mr. Obama's decision. A recent poll commissioned by Univision suggests that this position could hurt them with a key constituency, Latino voters. The survey found that 34 percent of prospective Latino voters would favor a candidate who continued Mr. Obama's Cuba policy, while 14 percent said the opposite. Among Cuban-Americans, 40 percent said they would back a candidate who favors normalizing relations, while 26 percent said they would not.Hillary Rodham Clinton made a forceful appeal to end the embargo in a speech in Miami on Friday, noting that Cubans want broader contact with the United States. ""They want to buy our goods, read our books, surf our web and learn from our people,"" she said. ""That is the road toward democracy and dignity, and we should walk it together.""",0.0
U.S. and China Proclaim Progress in Their Trade Talks:   [Business/Financial Desk ] [1 ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. GUANGZHOU, China -- In their first top-level trade talks since President Obama hosted China's leader in September, the United States and China said on Monday that they had made progress on sticking points, including preventing the theft of trade secrets and opening the Chinese market more broadly to American multinationals.Still, the lack of larger breakthroughs on bigger issues -- like negotiations for a broad trade deal -- contrasted with America's improving economic ties with the rest of Asia.The two countries have been eyeing each other cautiously.Mr. Obama has been trying to strengthen relations in the region, through deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which lowers trade barriers between the United States and several other Asian nations. But the deal excludes China.President Xi Jinping is pushing for China, with its newfound financial muscle, to play a greater role in the global economy. But his sometimes nationalistic stance has squeezed Western multinationals operating in China.Two days of trade talks in this southern port city yielded modest commitments from China to address some issues.Officials agreed to extend better legal protections to American companies that have lost trade secrets to theft, including clarifying their ability to seek preliminary injunctions in Chinese courts. They also made progress on opening the Chinese market wider to American manufacturers of drugs and medical devices, specifically easing the path to clinical trials.China also appeared to step back further from regulations that were proposed this year -- but shelved -- that would have encouraged its huge banking sector to favor locally made technology and communication products.""We're tackling these issues in a fairly open, frank and candid manner that I think is allowing us to make progress,"" Penny Pritzker, the commerce secretary of the United States, said on Monday in an interview after the annual talks, which have been held since the 1980s and are known as the United States-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade.Given the often-technical nature of the negotiations between the United States and China, ""the expectations weren't real high,"" said Myron Brilliant, the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who was here for the talks. ""But it was important that the forum addressed issues raised by Obama and Xi."">China is on track this year to surpass Canada as the biggest single trading partner of the United States. But as trade has ballooned in recent years, tensions have grown. China sells far more goods to the United States than it buys, resulting in a Chinese trade surplus with the United States of $218 billion in the first 10 months of this year.Despite an overall slump in China's exports and imports this year, Chinese factories continue to do brisk business selling goods to Americans. China's merchandise exports to the United States rose 5.2 percent in the first 10 months of the year to a record $340 billion, according to Chinese customs data. China's overall exports, by contrast, have declined 2.5 percent over the same period.American companies as varied as soybean farms and shampoo manufacturers are also making fast progress in tapping the rapidly changing Chinese consumer market. Matthew Price, the greater China chairman of Procter & Gamble, noted in a speech Sunday to American and Chinese business leaders on the sidelines of the trade talks how Chinese women on average use more skin moisturizers than their American counterparts. More than a third of the company's sales in China take place online, compared with only about 10 percent in the United States, he added.Among the more controversial issues in the trade relationship have been Beijing's many limits on foreign services companies, which in America contribute the biggest share of economic output.For example, China this year has raised hackles among Western tech companies, many of whose services are blocked in the country, by asking them to hand over source code as one of several measures to ensure their products remain ""secure and controllable."" Those companies fear that phrase could be very broadly defined by the Chinese government.On the Chinese side, officials want broader access to acquisitions in the United States, especially when it comes to American regulatory treatment of China's tens of thousands of state-owned enterprises. Of particular concern to the Chinese has been the transparency of the review process for deals carried out by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which involves many government agencies and is led by the Treasury Department.Zhang Xiangchen, the deputy China international trade representative at China's ministry of commerce, said on Monday after the talks that the United States and China hoped to expand trade, but obstacles remained.""China's investments in the U.S. are subject to some barriers, such as uncertain and untransparent security checks,"" Mr. Zhang said. ""On the other hand, the U.S. hopes China can open up its market more. Both these concerns are legitimate.""Beyond the services sector, another area of intense American interest has been greater access to the Chinese market for American agricultural products, and seeking greater clarity on the regulatory and scientific standards that Beijing imposes on imports.Despite lobbying here by American officials, including Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, China appeared ready to give little immediate ground on this issue.""We need to be open to importing advanced technology and enriching the variety of food offered to the people,"" Wang Yang, the vice premier in charge of trade issues who led the Chinese delegation, said at a briefing on Sunday.""At the same time, we must protect the interests of our 700 million farmers,"" Mr. Wang added. ""In recent years, our agricultural costs have been rising, but prices have hit a ceiling caused by the decline in international commodity prices. We face a lot of challenges in terms of how to increase farmers' incomes and achieve sustainable agricultural development.""Ms. Pritzker said that, in response to concerns raised by Mr. Wang, the United States would revise how it handles controls on exports to China of civilian technologies it now deems delicate.""We have agreed to develop a mechanism to improve the exchange of information on individual cases of commercial high-tech items exported to China,"" Ms. Pritzker said.",0.0
2 Daughters of the Bronx Share More Than a Name:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"The sounds of summer drifted through the air on the Bronx side of the High Bridge, from the squeals of children running along sun-dappled paths to the slaps of flip-flops hitting the pavement as boys with towels slung over their shoulders walked to the public swimming pool on the Manhattan side. Two women chatting on a bench stopped midsentence as two other women, smiling and familiar looking, ambled past.""Ay!"" one of the women on the bench exclaimed. ""Sonia! Que linda!""Actually, both of the smiling women were named Sonia: Justice Sonia Sotomayor of the Supreme Court and Sonia Manzano, the actress who played Maria on ""Sesame Street"" before announcing recently that she was retiring from the show. This kind of encounter happens every summer in the Bronx, as these two women with boldface names return to the borough of their childhood to reconnect, give back and -- in this case -- enjoy the view of the recently reopened High Bridge, New York City's original High Line. They don't need to trumpet that they're from the block: Chances are, sooner or later, you just might see them on your block.For years, the two Sonias have headlined the Bronx Children's Museum's annual ""Dream Big"" event, a summer celebration for an institution that is set to finally move into a brick-and-mortar home in 2017. And while both women get more requests for public and charitable appearances than they could ever oblige, their dedication to the children of the Bronx is not charity, but a duty born of personal experience.Justice Sotomayor likes to say that you can't dream about what you don't know exists. In her world -- she grew up in the Bronxdale Houses, which now bear her name -- she aspired to the law while watching ""Perry Mason."" Now, she hopes to cast a similar spell on a few youngsters. After this year's museum event, at Fordham University last month, she and Ms. Manzano headed to the High Bridge for a brief tour with the city engineers who helped to restore it.""If kids don't know the possibilities, they can't dream,"" Justice Sotomayor said in an interview after the tour. ""They certainly can't dream bigger than the circumscribed world they're in. Unless I bring that to them, this new world I inhabit, they may never know the different things they can aspire to. To me, if being on the Supreme Court has any meaning, my legacy is to touch enough kids that some of them will feel inspired to do more than they know about today.""Justice Sotomayor, who lives in Washington, said she returns to New York every six to eight weeks, pulled back by the many friends and family members who still live here. That, too, attests to a lesson she learned as a child in the Bronx.""Everywhere I lived in the Bronx growing up, it was community, people knew each other,"" she said. ""People helped each other in need, like when my father died and everyone in the building came up to say something to us. It's community. To me, the Bronx has always meant that. It's a place where I grew up and where I learned the value of that extended family.""Among her extended family is Ms. Manzano, whose presence on ""Sesame Street"" for 44 years made her part of many people's childhood memories. She looks forward to seeing Justice Sotomayor at the museum's celebration, which highlights its summer arts program.In turn, the museum's heightened visibility -- thanks to the support of the two Sonias and others -- helped it secure the $9.6 million needed for the design and construction of its new home. Ms. Manzano recently wrote a children's book about the bridge and donated the profits to the museum, which offers much-needed activities.""I remember being so bored in the Bronx when I was a kid because there was nothing to do,"" said Ms. Manzano, who spent part of her childhood in the South Bronx, not far from where Justice Sotomayor lived. ""Sitting at the window for hours at a time, envying the shoeshine boys because they were allowed out of the house. This is an opportunity to address something I remember clearly as a drag, not having anything to do up there. It's natural for me to want to go back.""Few people noticed the two Sonias as they crossed the bridge -- although William Cantine, 26, managed to grab a selfie with the justice, who graduated from Cardinal Spellman High School, just as he had. Justice Sotomayor joked about wearing comfortable shoes, pointing to Ms. Manzano, who wore blue and chrome ""space heels"" that looked like a cross between slippers and shiny levers capable of launching her across the Harlem River.Justice Sotomayor asked the engineers earnest questions about what had been done to upgrade the 19th-century infrastructure during the renovation. She admitted that as proud as she was of the Bronx, she did not remember hearing much about the High Bridge in the 1970s (when she was busy attending Princeton and, later, Yale Law School).""Hopefully, for the next generation of kids it will be the place to get engaged,"" she said. ""Others will have their first kiss and others will find it a place to share.""And maybe a few of them will even return one day to tell the next generation about love, duty and the Bronx.Photograph (Photograph by David Gonzalez/the New York Times)",0.0
Animal Thought as Not-So-Wild Idea:   [Science Desk ],,"Given the subtitle of Carl Safina's fascinating and expansive new book, ""Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel,"" it's no surprise that Dr. Safina frequently discusses animal cognition.The surprise is that he also talks about animal precognition. (Read an excerpt.)""How do we explain certain remarkable stories about elephant communication?"" he asks at one point, noting that a conservationist who has worked with the animals for decades flatly believes in pachyderm telepathy. The conservationist says she has seen free-living elephants in Kenya show up at a nearby reserve just before rescued orphans were scheduled to arrive, ready to meet and greet.""I filed her claim in my mind's 'unlikely stories' bin,"" Dr. Safina acknowledges. ""But that bin gets cluttered; there are many 'unlikely' stories about elephants.""And not just elephants: In a chapter cheekily titled ""Woo-Woo,"" he entertains similar ideas about the psychic abilities of killer whales and other members of the dolphin family.Dr. Safina, a marine conservationist and professor at Stony Brook University on Long Island, is clearly unafraid to challenge scientific orthodoxy. He accepts as a given that animals are capable of thought and emotion, a proposition that, as he notes impatiently and not a little defensively, is far from settled among animal behaviorists.""Why do researchers judge the mental performance of other animals against a standard that humans could not possibly reach?"" he asks. ""You have to deeply deny the evidence to conclude that humans alone are conscious, feeling beings.""This renegade spirit is a source of the book's great charm, the pepper in its woo-woo sauce. Dr. Safina takes frequent droll pleasure in puncturing claims to human exceptionalism.""Maybe more than anything, what 'makes us human' is our ability to generate wacky ideas,"" he writes. And at another point: ""There is in nature an overriding sanity and often, in humankind, an undermining insanity. We, among all animals, are most frequently irrational, distortional, delusional, worried.""Dr. Safina is a terrific writer, majestic and puckish in equal measure, with a contagious enthusiasm for the complex social lives of the animals he's observing -- in this book, chiefly elephants, wolves and killer whales. If he pulls a bit of bait and switch, for long stretches abandoning his supposed theme of animal consciousness to focus instead on simple appreciation and advocacy, it's hard to object because he brings his subjects so vividly to life.Here he is, for instance, describing killer whales as they forage for salmon off Vancouver Island in British Columbia: ""Several whales bow their backs and dive steeply. Below, the fish have their attention. A couple of other whales slice rapidly through the surface, quickly switching directions.""""The closest whale, right behind us, is L-92. This big one over here with the high, wavy dorsal fin is K-25. He begins a series of high-arcing lunges, with lots of splashing and commotion. He's after one large, isolated fish. He dives away. When he suddenly bursts through the surface, his mass and momentum startle me wide-eyed.""The effect -- and surely the intention -- of such lively, physical description is to make Dr. Safina's readers feel as strong a connection to these animals as he does. Again and again he follows the same formula, familiar from nature documentaries: Draw close to the animals, explain their habits and family structures and personalities until we perceive them as individual characters, then detail the ways human culture is destroying their way of life.For elephants, that means ivory poaching; for wolves, the threat of hunters and trappers; for killer whales, everything from overfishing to underwater military explosions to the continued practice, in some places, of capturing young whales for use in aquarium shows.The strategy of making us see animals as individuals is undeniably effective, as anybody who has followed the story of Cecil the lion can attest. And Dr. Safina draws out haunting resonances between animal lives and our own. ""What I had not imagined,"" he writes of a Yellowstone wolf pack that fractured after hunters killed its alpha member, ""was the politics involved, the personalities, the vendettas and coalitions, the family turmoil following tragedy, the loyalties and disloyalties."" Dr. Safina describes the drama as ""all too human.""In the same section, he describes a legendary wolf from Yellowstone, the ""superwolf"" known by his tracking number 21, who never lost a fight and never killed an opponent.""Can a wolf be magnanimous?"" Dr. Safina asks. ""And if so, why?""But of course the nobility of animals is all a matter of perspective: Ask harbor seals how they feel about killer whales. And as persuasive as Dr. Safina is in calling for humans to tread more humanely on the earth -- his desire for ecological harmony sometimes carries pleasing echoes of the poet Gary Snyder -- ""Beyond Words"" remains most interesting when it focuses on the core question of nonhuman consciousness.That question also leads him to the most scientifically grounded sections of the book, discussing for example the chemical and neurological bases of emotions: ""Oxytocin drives bonding,"" he reminds readers, ""and it makes elephants and many other species act social or sexual. Block the hormone; many mammals and birds lose interest in socializing, pairing, nesting and contact."" Elsewhere he writes about brain size relative to body size, and the role of neuron density in determining mental dexterity.Throughout, he demonstrates a keen grasp of the scientific literature across a range of disciplines and a refreshing skepticism about the terms of debate. ""Only humans have human minds,"" he concedes. ""But believing that only humans have minds is like believing that because only humans have human skeletons, only humans have skeletons.""Finally, though, you get the feeling that for Dr. Safina, human consciousness is at least as pressing a concern as animal consciousness, and possibly more in doubt. ""The work,"" he writes near the end of this captivating book, ""is beautiful, and urgent, an almost holy quest for deeper intimacy. Not just with the whales. With the world.""Photograph Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel. By Carl Safina. Henry Holt and Co. 461 Pages. $32.",0.0
Hitting All the High Notes in Munich:   [The Arts/Cultural Desk ],,"MUNICH -- A bunch of hippies partying, then mourning, in a shadowy gray landscape. A stories-high crucifix propped ominously against a wall. A stark black stage outlined in neon white. A gyrating crowd of shirtless cowboys.When you see a great deal of opera in a short period of time, the performances sometimes start to bleed into one another, their details blurring. (Were those leather trench coats in ""Traviata"" or ""Turandot""? Did that soprano sing Mimi or Marguerite?) But over a few days spent at the Bavarian State Opera here recently, there was no mistaking any of the four productions I saw for any of the others. Each was distinctive, each indelible, each an inventive response to the work at hand. Each had a point of view.This mini-marathon, a taste of the annual five-week Munich Opera Festival that ended on Friday, confirmed impressions formed by previous visits, Internet simulcasts and word of mouth: No company manages the delicate balance of contemporary opera -- simultaneously maintaining high musical standards, attracting the finest singers and experimenting dramatically -- better than this one. Its festival, a mix of brand-new productions, stagings from the past season and immaculately cast revivals, has become perhaps the most dependably, densely exciting presentation of opera in the world.While under Peter Jonas, its director from 1993 until 2006, the State Opera broadened its repertory -- embracing the Baroque, especially -- and became more theatrically adventurous, it has truly come into its own under Nikolaus Bachler, in charge since 2008. A fixture in his parterre box above the orchestra pit, Mr. Bachler is unavoidable: If you're looking at the stage, chances are he's in your line of vision, too.In the late 1990s, when Mr. Bachler led the Volksoper in Vienna, one of the staff conductors was a young talent in his 20s named Kirill Petrenko. Over the subsequent decade, Mr. Petrenko began to rise swiftly through the profession, with positions at the opera house in Meiningen, Germany, and then the Komische Oper in Berlin, along with increasingly prominent guest stints at operas and orchestras around the world.A consummate showman, Mr. Bachler scored a coup by attracting his old colleague to Munich, and Mr. Petrenko started as music director here in 2013. That Mr. Petrenko was recently named chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, arguably the most prominent post in classical music, solidified Mr. Bachler's status as a kingmaker, or at least as a leader with exceptionally good, and prescient, taste. (That taste will cost him a conductor sooner than he probably wanted: Mr. Petrenko's contract here lasts just three more years, though efforts are underway to negotiate an extension before he devotes himself fully to Berlin.)Since he's spending the summer conducting Wagner's ""Ring"" cycle at the Bayreuth Festival, Mr. Petrenko was not in the pit for any of the performances I saw here. And, in fact, the conducting was the weakest part of the four evenings -- never disastrous, but also never the draw.Christopher Moulds fared best leading a small, crisp yet lyrical Baroque band in David Bösch's tenderly melancholy production of Monteverdi's ""Orfeo,"" new last summer and starring Christian Gerhaher. But Alain Altinoglu, in ""Manon Lescaut,"" didn't bring sufficient nuance to Puccini's thick orchestral textures, and Asher Fisch, in Verdi's ""Don Carlo,"" lacked grandeur. Leo Hussain adroitly followed the singers in Tchaikovsky's ""Eugene Onegin,"" but struggled to keep a firm hold on some swiftly shifting ensembles.These were showcases for singers and directors, not conductors. ""Onegin,"" in particular, fielded what might well be the best cast for that opera possible today: Anna Netrebko (sounding even more secure and voluptuous as Tatiana than she did at the Metropolitan Opera two years ago), Mariusz Kwiecien, Pavol Breslik and Günther Groissböck. All were in rich voice and passionately committed to Krzysztof Warlikowski's wrenching 2007 production.His staging has become known as a ""Brokeback Mountain"" take on the opera, not an entirely unfair characterization. Mr. Warlikowski clearly identifies the title character with Tchaikovsky, who agonized over his homosexuality; the breach between Onegin (Mr. Kwiecien, fervent) and his friend Lenski (Mr. Breslik, incisive) arises here from a love that only barely dares -- in this early-1970s provincial setting --speak its name.Their deadly duel is in this version a botched sex scene and is truly the opera's pivot point, setting off a nightmarish psychological descent for Onegin, who imagines himself falling more and more out of control of his desires. (That's where the seductively dancing cowboys come in.) The character's final appeal to Tatiana is even more desperate than usual, a last-ditch plea from the depths of the closet.Ms. Netrebko's participation was another of Mr. Bachler's coups, a victory snatched from the jaws of defeat. She had been scheduled last fall for the premiere of the ""Manon Lescaut"" production, but dropped out after clashing with the director, Hans Neuenfels. Inserted instead into these festival performances of ""Onegin,"" she was replaced as Manon, in November and this summer, by Kristine Opolais, a detailed, ardent actress with a soprano that's clean but bodiless and colorless, a pencil drawing in lieu of a painting. Her Des Grieux, sung by the tenor Jonas Kaufmann, was the real star here, his tone dark-hued and stormy; as her brother, Lescaut, the baritone Markus Eiche sang with scowling intensity.The production was less inspired. While Mr. Neuenfels has in the past produced precise, multilayered stagings, like Wagner's ""Lohengrin"" as a rat-filled experiment at the Bayreuth Festival, his ""Manon Lescaut"" shows signs of uncertainty. At first he seems to be indicting society's obsession with acquisition and its degradation of women: The chorus is a mass of flame-haired, pear-shaped grotesques; piles of jewels sparkle on a nearly bare stage; and the cataloguing of female criminals is a severe, sobering affair.Perhaps Ms. Opolais's Manon was a bit more depressive than usual in the first act, which is normally cheerful. But too often this felt like a standard-issue ""Lescaut,"" just with less furniture. There was no chill in the conception of the characters and situations to match the effectively icy sets.Less daring but more satisfying was Jürgen Rose's ""Don Carlo,"" with its looming crucifix, first seen here in 2000. Sometimes static, it nevertheless conjures the moodiness, the pervasive gloom, that this opera requires. Starring as the reluctant queen Elisabetta was the soprano Anja Harteros, who's become something of a house diva at the State Opera. (She is infamously prone to cancellations, but practically never in Munich.)Her voice attractively unsettled yet her sense of the musical line sustained, Ms. Harteros's Elisabetta was an intriguing mixture of strength and vulnerability, smoldering tone and hovering delicacy. Her fourth-act aria, ""Tu che le vanità,"" alternated between forcefully rhythmic passages and those that bend the line until time seems nearly to dissolve.As King Philip, René Pape was, as usual, commanding of voice and somehow detached, his outpouring in ""Ella giammai m'amò"" elegant but uninvolving. If the tenor Alfred Kim rarely veered from loudness as Carlo, his sound, at least, was shining. The young baritone Simone Piazzola, the production's Rodrigo, was a model of robust tone and sensitive phrasing.It wasn't perfect. Opera hardly ever is. But in Munich these days it comes closer, more consistently, than anywhere else I know.Photograph Feats of Casting: Anna Netrebko, Left, and Alisa Kolosova in Krzysztof Warlikowski's Production of Tchaikovsky's ""Eugen Onegin"" at the Munich Opera Festival.

"They May Be Neighbors, but They Don't Always Play Together:   [Review ]",,"With Japanese music still lingering in memory from the Juilliard School's weeklong, storm-abbreviated Focus! festival last month, the New York presenter Music From Japan strutted its stuff with its own festival over the weekend. In two programs at Asia Society, Music From Japan, long a force in opening pathways for Japanese music in the West, was also celebrating its 40th anniversary.A chamber concert on Sunday afternoon, presenting five works commissioned by the organization, two of them new, seemed virtually a continuation of the Focus! festival's exploration of Japanese music since 1945. But an intimate concert on Saturday evening, ""East Asian Vibrancy,"" plunged deep into the world of traditional instruments, which Focus! had mostly avoided, and expanded the range in both time and place, offering classical and contemporary music from Japan, China and South Korea.In a preconcert lecture-demonstration, Ralph Samuelson, a performer and scholar, spoke of the ""energetic musical life"" in those countries today but noted that ""traditional, folk and classical music are still there, alive and well."" As proof, the concert presented three noted performers on traditional instruments: Mayumi Miyata playing the Japanese sho, a mouth organ; Wu Man, the Chinese pipa, a pear-shaped lute; and Jin Hi Kim, the Korean komungo, a large, deep zitherlike instrument. Each performed something from her instrument's classical repertory and something contemporary.The solo demonstrations and performances were brilliant and fascinating, effectively staking out the individualities of the instruments. But you had to wonder how they would combine, in a sort of jam improvisation after intermission and in the premiere of Ned Rothenburg's ""Unkai"" (""Sea of Clouds""), which followed.Not always well, it turned out. The hyperactive pipa and the spacious komungo, as string instruments, made relative peace with each other, but the unearthly, reedy sho seemed hard put to enter the conversation.Michio Kitazume's ""Distances III,"" given its premiere on Sunday, was captivating. It played clarinet (Richard Stoltzman) against cello (Fred Sherry) in a shifting perspective, each instrument thrusting and receding. Dynamic contrasts suggested physical distance. Mr. Stoltzman's ultra-pianissimos, at the very limit of audibility, were particularly remarkable.Yoichi Sugiyama's ""Two Verses by Du Fu"" for voice, viola, clarinet and piano, was the other new work on Sunday. In English, it was elusive in its spare, angular melodies and slightly jarring in some fragmented phrasing. Wonjung Kim, a soprano, gave the songs a fine turn, as she did Joji Yuasa's melodious ""Oyasuminasai"" (""Good Night""), from 2013, with Stephen Gosling on piano.Mr. Gosling and Mr. Sherry anchored Ichiro Nodaira's ""Quatuor en Hiver"" (""Quartet in Winter""), from 2003, and the violinist Mari Kimura gave a stellar performance of Mari Takano's ""Full Moon"" (2008-9) over electronic tracks on which she also played.The Music From Japan festival will travel to the Freer Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington on Tuesday; musicfromjapan.org.Photograph Music From Japan: This Asia Society Festival Featured East Asian Instruments: From Left, the Pipa (China), Played by Wu Man; the Sho (Japan), Played by Mayumi Miyata; and the Komungo (Korea), Played by Jin Hi Kim.

Guesswork in Cashing In Delta's Miles:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"For about a quarter-century, frequent-flier miles have represented a kind of magic for many consumers.You'd take a bunch of trips that you would have taken anyway and earn miles along the way. After a while, you'd earn a free flight. If you earned enough miles, you could spin the globe and travel to whatever point it stopped at.That feeling of possibility was priceless.But that magic was a trick. All along, those free seats were probably ones that the airlines weren't going to be able to fill with paying customers, so they were nearly free for the carriers to give away.Over the last 18 months, Delta Air Lines has been engaged in some sleight of hand of its own. The airline no longer posts any award chart explaining how many miles your free tickets will require, the way that United and American Airlines still do. But Delta also hasn't moved to a transparent miles redemption system that is based entirely on the cash price that the ""free"" ticket would otherwise cost, as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways do.Instead, Delta issues proclamations like this one that came along a few weeks ago: ""For travel on or after June 1, 2016, the number of miles needed will change based on destination, demand and other considerations. But most Award prices will remain unchanged.""Which destinations? How much demand? What other considerations? Which prices? The airline won't say. You're just supposed to cross your fingers and hope that you have enough miles come vacation time or if you have to get to a funeral quickly. Or hope for some magic.If you fly Delta or any other airline more than a few times each year, you probably collect miles. Most redemptions that people make are for free tickets in the United States. As a result, even the most casual participants have long anchored their expectations according to the following calculation: If you have 25,000 miles, you ought to be able to get that free round-trip ticket reasonably easily.But in recent years, a couple of things have changed. For one, airlines like JetBlue have moved away from rewarding people for distance traveled and toward giving out points based on what those customers paid.When it comes to redeeming those miles and points, it became clear that even the airlines that still encouraged that 25,000 mental redemption anchor weren't necessarily abiding by it. Perhaps that price would be available for a trip to El Paso in August at 6 a.m. on a Tuesday, but the round-trip flights most people really wanted would often require more miles.Delta customers have long complained about reward availability at the 25,000-mile level, and its executives freely acknowledge that airline consumers in general should abandon any sense of expectations around this fixed price. ""The 25,000-mile round-trip award fare that historically has been a standard for the airlines, I think you're going to see that completely change,"" Karen Zachary, who runs Delta's SkyMiles program, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in May.Ideally, you'd replace magic with math in the frequent-flier equation. But figuring out what a mile is worth requires knowing what flights will actually cost. And the only way to figure that out with Delta now is to try to actually book one in real time.Aside from the frequent travelers on the website FlyerTalk, which remains must-reading for consumers who want to do the math and decode the moves of Delta and other airlines, one of the carrier's biggest critics in recent months has been Gary Leff. Mr. Leff has a day job working as a chief financial officer at a university research center, but he spends his spare time running a service that helps people redeem their miles and blogging about loyalty programs. He has posted about Delta repeatedly.Delta does offer some free flights for less than 25,000 miles round-trip now. But Mr. Leff has done the math and has pointed out that the value you get per mile (when compared with the cash cost of the ticket) seems to rarely exceed two cents, an important figure that we'll come back to shortly. Also, free flights in business class to Australia on Delta (long one of the magic redemption destinations for mile hoarders industrywide) now sometimes cost 830,000 miles per ticket, multiples of the former price.The lack of clear predictable pricing irks Mr. Leff, even as it may help drive more people to his award-booking service. ""I think Delta is not telling the truth, at a macro level, about the direction they're taking the program,"" he said. ""And they're making it harder for members to understand what their miles are worth.""I tried to get a Delta spokesman, Anthony Black, to address Mr. Leff's truthiness point squarely, but I failed to get much that was new other than a link to a list of low-cost redemption opportunities. Delta seems to think that no award chart should be necessary given that so many people redeem their miles for domestic tickets that only have a few different prices anyway. But if that's the case, why not offer a permanent list of the range of possibilities for each market and explain what the rough odds are of actually getting the cheaper rates? Yes, consumers are used to unpredictable cash prices when they pay with their own money. But mileage programs were built on a different system of expectations, and people have saved those miles, often for years, accordingly.United and American customers who are aware of Delta's moves are worried that those carriers will follow suit. ""We won't comment on any such changes, planned or otherwise,"" said Rahsaan Johnson, a United spokesman. That's not exactly encouraging. At least American's representative, Laura Nedbal, said that the carrier planned no changes to its award chart, albeit with the now-standard ""at this time"" disclaimer. ""We are always watching the competitive environment, and we'll make sure AAdvantage is positioned as an industry-leading loyalty program,"" she added.Many of you are more or less stuck with your airline. With just a handful of big carriers left, there may be only one reasonable alternative for decent flight times where you live, or perhaps your employer forces you to fly one airline.Plenty of people, however, earn many of their miles off the plane, by putting all of their spending on credit cards that earn miles. If you're disgusted with Delta or worried about other carriers, then it's probably time to switch to a credit card that offers cash back or its own proprietary reward points worth a guaranteed 2 cents for every dollar you spend. Delta miles probably won't be worth that much if you're redeeming them for domestic plane tickets. I wrote a column in May that describes all of these cards in detail.There are some exceptions here. For now, you can still redeem Delta miles with its international partners for reasonable sums. That could change, but until it does, those redemptions offer good value if you can earn enough miles and have the flexibility to fly when the free seats are available. And all of the credit card issuers that have partnerships with airlines, knowing that the value of the mile is almost certainly in decline, have started offering other goodies in recent years that may be attractive to some customers. Those goodies include free bag checking or the ability to board the plane in the fourth group instead of the seventh and actually find room in the overhead bins for your bag.American Express issues the Delta credit cards, and when I asked the card company whether it thought the value of Delta miles had increased, decreased or stayed the same over the last two years, it refused to answer. That tells you all you need to know, doesn't it?In Mr. Leff's eyes, Delta and the other carriers have made a point to slowly change redemptions so that people are no longer getting outsize value from their miles when they want or need it most. The magic, in other words, is seeping out of the system. ""Most people are no longer getting the leverage out of the programs that made them special,"" he said. ""They've turned them into rebate programs, almost like a punch card.""You probably would make changes like this, too, if you were an airline executive. Many of them rue the day in 1981 when American Airlines introduced its frequent-flier program and they resent the consumer entitlement that resulted, even if airlines did take for granted the loyalty that the programs fostered for so long. Shareholders have no problem with stinginess and opacity either, as long as it doesn't drive customers away and the planes stay as full as they have been of late.As for all of the people who no longer get anywhere near the value they once did from their miles, at least there's this bit of magic left: It is still amazing that you can close your eyes in a metal tube in Los Angeles and wake up close to Sydney, even if it takes many hundreds of thousands of frequent-flier miles to get there for free.Make the most of your money.

Evaluating Military and Moral Fallout of Atomic Bomb:   [Foreign Desk ],,"Did the United States have to drop the bomb?Seventy years after the United States launched the atomic age with attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, hastening the end of the war in the Pacific, The New York Times asked readers how they viewed the decision by President Harry S. Truman.At the time, Truman defended his decision to drop the bombs as the only way to avoid a full-scale invasion of Japan. That, arguably, would have cost more lives, American and Japanese, than the approximately 200,000 who died in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.The anniversary of the Nagasaki attack will be commemorated at the city's Peace Park on Sunday with a ceremony that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will attend.Critics have contended that the Japanese were sending signals that they were prepared to surrender, but that these were either missed or ignored, and that the United States wanted to demonstrate to the world -- particularly the Soviet Union -- the awesome power it had at its disposal.We received thousands of responses, including justifications, condemnations, indictments and explanations. And though the 70 years since the bombings have helped provide perspective -- and more historical knowledge about what was happening at that time in the war -- they have not yielded much consensus.Here are excerpts from selected responses, lightly edited for clarity.Judging Truman's LegacyThis was an act of terrorism against the civilian population to achieve a political objective, a quintessential war crime. Harry Truman was a war criminal.-- LAWRENCE MOSS; N.Y., N.Y.>Truman did the right thing. Whether it saved Japanese lives is immaterial, it was politically correct and saved American lives and ended the war.-- FRANK DOOLITTLE; Paradise Valley, Ariz.>Dropping the bombs was a 1945 decision not a 2015 one. To Truman, 200,000 Japanese lives lost was better than 400,000 killed and wounded American lives. To add to that were the billions of dollars spent on developing the bomb and the means to deliver it, the B-29. If the bomb were not dropped and lives were lost, why was the bomb even developed?-- EDWARD WYSOCKI; Bowie, Md.>Putting myself back in August 1945, the Axis powers had no hesitation in bombing, torturing and murdering anyone associated with the Allied cause. If I was in the Enola Gay on that morning, I believe I would have looked at it as just a real big bomb that might put a quick end to the war. Given the means to do it, I believe I would have dropped a bomb every day until the emperor himself said, ""Please, no more."" Good for President Truman: He did what was necessary to stomp out evil.-- GEORGE HERRINGTON; Carmel, Ind.>The display of power was necessary to ensure the security of Europe and Asia from the threat of a Soviet-instigated war in the aftermath of World War II. Further, the American electorate had a desire for revenge and so it was politically advantageous to drop the bomb. Finally, to imply that moral and rational behavior are the same in war as in peace is a gross simplification of events past.-- JORDAN HALL; Kent, England>Alternatives to the Atomic BombOne need only look at the casualty estimates of the planned invasion of Japan to see how horrific the alternative might have been. The decision to drop the bomb by the United States is tragic, and American officials should always mourn with the people of Japan. Without the unfortunate decision to drop the bomb, the war would have dragged on and the losses for both sides would have been catastrophic.-- ZACHARY HOFFMAN; Columbus, Ohio>I do not argue against dropping an atomic bomb to hasten the end of a terrible war, but I disagree with targeting Hiroshima, Nagasaki or any other urban area. Instead, the United States should have selected a remote location. This would have demonstrated the imposing power of the atomic bomb and the uselessness of the Japanese government continuing the war, while saving the lives of tens of thousands of civilians, many of whom suffered incredibly gruesome injuries.-- JOHN VANKAT; Flagstaff, Ariz.>Even if we accept that dropping the bomb was necessary to force Japan to surrender unconditionally, no one has ever adequately explained why we couldn't have had the same effect by dropping the first bomb on an uninhabited part of Japan. Even if Japan refused to surrender after the first bomb and we had had to drop the second, as happened in 1945, still only half as many people would have been killed. Did no one think of this at the time?-- ELIZABETH MICHOUD; Stow, Mass.>Weighing the Moral ConsequencesThe decision to drop the bomb on Hiroshima at 8:15 in the morning, the time when the maximum number of people were outside commuting for schools and offices so that the maximum number of civilians could be killed, cannot be justified by any reasons whatsoever.-- TAKEO KONDO; Tokyo, Japan>Dropping the bomb on Hiroshima was an act of great moral callousness and evil. A military, rather than civilian, target could have been selected. If we wished, we could have contained Japanese aggression for another handful of months, shared the atomic bomb research with our allies, demonstrated the bomb's power on an uninhabited island or evacuated city, and brought the war to a close without sacrificing another 200,000 civilians.-- MATTHEW PENNIMAN; Lansing, Mich.>Two positive things came out of Hiroshima and Nagasaki: fewer casualties than Operation Downfall, and an exposure to this horror that ensured the Cold War never became hot. These bombings displayed the moral repugnancy of using nuclear weapons to civilians; without such approbation to keep its use in check, would the military ranks of one of the nuclear powers have broken to use these weapons of horror? The use of atomic weapons on Japan was militarily and morally justified, both in 1945 and 2015. Yet it was, and still remains, a deeply regrettable action of historical proportions.-- CHRISTOPHER HALL; West Barnstable, Mass.>Dropping the atomic bomb was a strategically effective decision for the United States to achieve victory in the Pacific. Yet the multitude of civilian casualties cannot be considered collateral damage because they were in fact the actual target of the attack. It was a large scale shock-and-awe strategy that was condemnable because these attacks were not only attacks against an enemy, but attacks against the very fabric of humanity.-- RENAN CABRERA; Doha, Qatar>An Invasion AvoidedIt's personal for me. My father was a weather forecaster. He would have been in the first wave of the invasion had it occurred. Someone has to provide precise information to the next waves to direct artillery. The projected casualties were over 30 percent. In all likelihood, I would not have been born.-- LINDA BLONSLEY; Arroyo Grande, Calif.>I am here, no doubt, because the bomb was dropped. My father was on a ship filled with young Americans steaming to Japan for a final invasion. It was predicted to be a brutal campaign. When the bombs were dropped and Japan surrendered, the news came to the ship and my father told me a cheer spread from one end to the other, as thousands of young American boys knew that the battle would not need to be fought.-- HAROLD GRODMAN; Charleston, W.Va.>My father's Army Engineer Corps unit was shipping its equipment to a forward staging area for the invasion of Japan. My brothers and sister and I would not be here if our dad was in that invasion. Thousands -- if not millions -- of other baby boomers would not have been born. The United States had to drop the bomb. Why suffer even more casualties? The bombs ended it.-- JAY BODENSTEIN; The Villages, Fla.>",0.0
"Jobless Claims Rise, but Less Than Expected:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"WASHINGTON -- (Reuters) The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week, suggesting labor market conditions are continuing to tighten.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 270,000 for the week ended Aug. 1, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It was the 22nd consecutive week that claims held below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strengthening labor market.""The unemployment claims are consistent with continued solid job creation and a reduction in labor market slack over time,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Economists had expected claims to rise to 273,000 last week. The data has no bearing on the employment report for July, which will be released on Friday by the Labor Department. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by 223,000, matching June's gain.Though job growth has slowed from last year's brisk pace, the unemployment rate, at 5.3 percent, is near the 5 to 5.2 percent range that most Federal Reserve officials consider consistent with full employment.Last week, the Fed upgraded its assessment of the jobs market, describing employment gains as ""solid."" The central bank, which is expected to raise interest rates this year for the first time in nearly a decade, also said labor market slack had diminished ""since early this year.""The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it smooths week-to-week volatility, fell 6,500, to 268,250, last week.A separate report from global outplacement consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed planned job cuts by American employers surged 136 percent to near a four-year high of 105,696 workers in July.The United States Army, which plans to eliminate about 57,000 troops and civilian employees over the next two years, accounted for more than half of the planned job cuts last month.Economists, however, expect minimal impact on the labor market from the layoffs, as military personnel are not included in the monthly payrolls count.""The impacts are expected to be almost negligible given the size of the announced job cuts relative to the overall labor force, as well as the fact that unemployment rates for veterans tend to not be that much different than unemployment rates for nonveterans,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.Employers in the technology sector, including Microsoft, Qualcomm and Intel, announced 18,891 job cuts in July.",0.0
ISIS Affiliate Issues Threat Over Hostage:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- Egyptian militants affiliated with the Islamic State extremist group have threatened to kill a hostage from Croatia within 48 hours unless the Egyptian government releases female prisoners, according to a video released Wednesday.It was the first time in a two-year-old campaign of violence against the government that the militants had kidnapped or threatened to kill a foreigner, raising new fears of more attacks.Many analysts had warned that the Sinai jihadists might take aim at foreign citizens or Egypt's Christian minority after they pledged their loyalty last fall to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and the video comes just two months after the militants' first attempts to attack the crucial tourism industry.In the video, a man who identifies himself as Tomislav Salopek, wearing a peach-colored jumpsuit and kneeling in the sand, addresses the camera. Speaking in English, he says that he is married with two children, works for a French company with a branch in Cairo and was abducted on July 22. A man wearing a camouflage uniform and mask stands behind him, holding a knife.Mr. Salopek, a 30-year-old citizen of Croatia, says that the militants want to ""substitute"" him with Muslim women in Egyptian prisons and adds that it needs to happen within 48 hours. ""If not, the soldiers of Wilayat al-Sina will kill me,"" he says, using the Arabic name of the militant group, which is also known as Sinai Province.The footage resembles videos released by Islamic State militants in Iraq, Syria and Libya, a sign of possibly closer coordination between the Egyptian jihadists and militants abroad.It presents a new challenge to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as he welcomes hundreds of foreign dignitaries for the inauguration of a new channel of the Suez Canal on Thursday, an event the government has promoted as a sign of Egypt's prosperous future.Insurgents who have been attacking the government since the military's ouster of President Mohamed Morsi in 2013 have carried out a series of brazen assaults in recent months that show a growing sophistication and a willingness to broaden their targets to include civilians. Since late June, militants have assassinated the country's top prosecutor, fired a missile at an Egyptian naval vessel and briefly occupied a town in the northern Sinai Peninsula.Militants also attempted attacks near the Pyramids of Giza and the Karnak Temple at Luxor, Egypt's most popular tourist destinations, in an ominous turn for the government, which depends heavily on the foreign currency generated by tourism.The kidnapping of Mr. Salopek also suggested that workers at foreign companies are under threat. The Croatian government announced his kidnapping last month, without naming him, saying that one of its citizens had been abducted by unidentified armed men in Cairo while driving to work in a company car, The Associated Press reported at the time.In the video, Mr. Salopek said he worked for CGG Ardiseis, a French company involved in the oil and gas industry.",0.0
Syrian Official's Visit to Oman May Signal a Diplomatic Opening:   [Foreign Desk ],,"Syria's government sent a high-level delegation on Thursday to Oman, the Persian Gulf state that historically has helped broker negotiations in regional conflicts.The delegation was led by Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, in his first visit to Oman since the Syrian war began more than four years ago.Arranged at the invitation of the Omanis, the visit raised new speculation that diplomatic energy is intensifying to seek a way to end the war.The official news agencies of Syria and Oman prominently reported the visit, in which Mr. Moallem conferred with his Omani counterpart, Yusuf bin Alawi. Specific details were not disclosed, but Sana, the Syrian agency, said both agreed that the ""time has come for unifying constructive efforts to put an end to the crisis in Syria.""The war has left a quarter of a million people dead, displaced half of Syria's population, created a vibrant incubator for Islamic extremism and sown instability in the Middle East.Mr. Moallem's visit came amid other signs of possible diplomatic shifts on Syria, along with indications that the government of President Bashar al-Assad was losing ground militarily.Last week, for example, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, announced that he had invited a range of Syrians to participate in separate discussions on how to restart peace talks.The United States and Turkey also began a joint military effort last week to strike Islamic State targets in Syria and provide safe zones along northern Syria's 500-mile border with Turkey.And the United States and Russia, in a rare instance of cooperation over Syria, agreed Wednesday on a United Nations Security Council resolution to identify and hold accountable the users of chlorine bombs in the war, widely believed to be forces loyal to Mr. Assad.Oman has often played a quiet role as a conciliator in the region. It helped in recent years to broker the release of French aid workers held by Qaeda extremists in Yemen and of three American hikers held in Iran.It was also the host of secret talks between the United States and Iran a few years ago that helped revive negotiations on the disputed Iranian nuclear program, which yielded an agreement last month.Oman is the only country in the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council that has not joined the Saudi-led military coalition bombing Yemen, and in recent months, it has sought to help find a solution to the conflict there as well.Mr. Assad, who is closely allied with Iran, has strained relations with many other countries in the region because of the war in Syria, which began in March 2011 as a political uprising against him and morphed into a civil conflict that has become a breeding ground for extremist groups, most notably the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, an affiliate of Al Qaeda.Last month, Mr. Assad conceded on national television that he faced a recruitment problem in the armed forces, which have ceded territory to the Islamic State, mainly in northern and eastern Syria.On Thursday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain with a contact network in Syria, said Islamic State fighters had seized Qaryatayn, a town in central Syria.If confirmed, it would be the group's first capture of a strategically important town in Syria since Islamic State fighters seized Palmyra, a storied ancient city, in May.",0.0
Central African Republic: Kidnapped Official Is Freed:   [Brief ],,"Militia fighters have released a government minister seized more than two weeks ago in the Central African Republic, officials and relatives said Wednesday. The government official, Armel Mingatoloum Sayo, who serves as minister of sports and youth, was abducted Jan. 25 from his car in the capital, Bangui. The circumstances of Mr. Sayo's release were not immediately clear on Wednesday. He was believed to have been taken by Christian militia fighters. The country exploded into sectarian violence in 2013 after Christian militia fighters tried to overthrow a government led by Muslim rebels. A transitional government put in place about a year ago is supposed to organize elections for later this year, but instability and violence threaten to derail that goal.",0.0
"Part Villain, Part Victim, Tarkanian Simply Won:   [Sports Desk ]",,"It was strange that Dean Smith and Jerry Tarkanian died within days of each other. They were coaching peers from opposite sides of the reputational spectrum, with Smith, the longtime coach at North Carolina, remembered as the gentlemanly throwback to a time when coaching was done right and Tarkanian cast as the misunderstood pioneer of an era -- the same era -- when it all went wrong.Smith's legacy was painted in sepia tones, tinged in Carolina blue. Among his noted achievements was a player graduation rate close to 97 percent.Tarkanian will be recalled far more colorfully, as someone who turned tradition inside out, bringing a fast-paced style and pro-style glamour previously unseen in college sports. Tarkanian acknowledged, a decade after taking over Nevada-Las-Vegas, that only six of his players had graduated. Yet his bronze likeness sits, chomping a towel, outside the university's on-campus arena.It can be hard to know what we want most from our college coaches. Tarkanian showed, as much as anyone, that the answers are, mostly, wins and entertainment.There was no one in college basketball like Tarkanian, who died in Las Vegas on Wednesday at age 84. He was reviled or revered, a saint or a sinner, depending on perspective and allegiance. But age and time have a way of softening the burrs of bad reputations. They turn rebels into forward thinkers.The N.C.A.A. helped turn Tarkanian into an anti-establishment hero. He was less a rebel than a symbol -- a mascot, really, with his own name (Tark the Shark) and a comical hangdog expression -- for the win-at-all-cost appetite of so many fans, their judgment clouded by an affinity to the colors of a particular university.Like most sports, college basketball can be a dirty game when examined too closely. Tarkanian understood that college basketball's one shining moment, as glorified at the end of the N.C.A.A. tournament each spring, is actually composed of a million murky moments along the way.Tarkanian took three programs to the N.C.A.A. tournament -- and all three on to N.C.A.A. probation. He won nearly 80 percent of his games, but more than 50 of them were later redacted from his record for various violations.He was harangued by the N.C.A.A. for decades, tarnished by everything from findings of academic fraud to a photo of players in a hot tub with a reputed gambler twice convicted of bribery.He apologized for nothing, and his droopy eyes, like those of a bloodhound, lent him a look of the eternal victim. Tarkanian countered every accusation with plausible deniability. His best alibi was that others were doing things just as bad, or worse, and he was probably right.He earned a $2.5 million out-of-court settlement with the N.C.A.A., which he said had spent decades harassing him with investigations. He used the N.C.A.A. as his foil, and as the N.C.A.A. became more bureaucratic and less popular, Tarkanian won the public-relations war. He came across as the lesser villain, if not the hero to the underclass.""I would talk every day to guys, and they would thank me sometimes,"" Tarkanian, speaking of fellow coaches, told The New York Times in 2013. ""I fought for things they wanted to fight for. Everyone knows the system is broken. But no one ever says anything about it because they don't want to be connected to me. They know what people will think.""Tarkanian prided himself on building winning teams with players that other programs did not want or would not risk. He was among the first to recruit heavily from junior colleges. He was chastised constantly for handing out second chances but never saw it as an insult.He defended his approach while criticizing those of some of college basketball's revered programs, such as Kentucky and U.C.L.A. Nothing frustrated Tarkanian more than when he was cast as the sinner to John Wooden's saint. He suggested that the two were more alike than anyone, especially the N.C.A.A., cared to know.Tarkanian's successful five-year stint at Long Beach State ended in 1973, shortly before N.C.A.A. investigators found recruiting violations. The N.C.A.A. practically set up a satellite office in Las Vegas when Tarkanian went to U.N.L.V., where its 1990 national championship was sandwiched by a stream of allegations of misdeeds and fights with the N.C.A.A.For the colleges that hired him, and the fans who adored him, the probability of violations was no match for the prestige of victories. Tarkanian's quick success at U.N.L.V. led to the building of the Thomas & Mack Center, where the front row, nicknamed Gucci Row, was filled with celebrities who cheered the fleet-footed teams that Tarkanian supplied. The Rebels still play in the arena, located off Tarkanian Way.Fresno State, Tarkanian's alma mater, wanted some of that, too, so it lured Tarkanian out of retirement in 1995. Victories piled up over seven seasons, although 49 of them were eventually vacated because of rules violations. There were investigations by the N.C.A.A. and an exposé on ""60 Minutes."" Among a string of incidents, there were accusations of point shaving and a series of player arrests, with one alleged assault involving a samurai sword.Tarkanian's legacy at Fresno State included a $100 million arena and a stretch under N.C.A.A. probation stemming from academic fraud. When Tarkanian returned to Fresno to be celebrated last March, his name was lifted to the rafters, and he was given a standing ovation.Tarkanian's family and supporters spent years campaigning to get him into the Basketball Hall of Fame, to join the likes of Dean Smith. But the call did not come until 2013, when his health was failing.In the end, the victories were too much too ignore. Tarkanian was no longer the rebel, if he ever was, but part of the establishment.Photograph Coach Jerry Tarkanian in 1990 with His U.N.L.V.

Admissions Quota Proposed in Brooklyn School Rezoning:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"Responding to concerns that a plan to redraw two Brooklyn school zones would fill an elementary school with affluent white children that currently serves mostly low-income minority children, Education Department staff members said on Monday that students receiving free or reduced-price lunches would be given admissions priority for half the seats in each class at the school.The department has said it wants to rezone the Dumbo and Vinegar Hill neighborhoods, where apartments sell for millions of dollars, so that children now zoned for Public School 8 in Brooklyn Heights, which is overcrowded and has a mostly white student body, would be zoned for Public School 307, which serves a public-housing project, educates mostly black and Hispanic children and has room to spare.The proposal to set aside half the school's seats came during a presentation of the rezoning plan to the community education council covering P.S. 307, the locally elected body responsible for voting on zone lines. Some parents at the school had asked the department for such set-asides to prevent the school population from becoming largely white.Whether preserving a portion of seats for students with lower incomes ultimately accomplishes those parents' goal would depend on how many students in the redrawn zone want to attend P.S. 307. Families living in the zone would have priority over students from outside the zone, even those who qualified for subsidized lunch.The Education Department said its current projections assume that the school would eventually have enough capacity for 30 percent of its students to come from outside the zone. The department also said that, though its plans call for the rezoning to take effect in 2016, it would not put the admissions plan in place until at least the following year, so as not to risk violating the terms of a federal grant.Faraji Hannah-Jones, co-president of the P.S. 307 parent-teacher association, expressed displeasure with the department's proposal. (Mr. Hannah-Jones's wife, Nikole Hannah-Jones, is a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine.)""When we said 50 percent, we didn't say 50 percent with conditions,"" he said. ""We said 50 percent, period.""He added: ""We don't want P.S. 307 to become P.S. 8.""The rezoning plan has drawn objections from current P.S. 307 parents, as well as parents who would fall into the expanded P.S. 307 zone. The Education Department originally planned to meet with the P.S. 307 council in September, but held off in order to hold a series of meetings with parents, teachers and neighborhood organizations. After hearing the department's presentation on Monday, the council has 45 days to vote on it. The council will vote only on the proposed new zone lines, not on the idea of setting aside half the school's seats for low-income families.The Education Department recently abandoned a similar rezoning proposal on the Upper West Side of Manhattan amid intense controversy. Under that proposal, several blocks were to be moved from a zone serving a highly regarded, mostly white school to one serving a mostly black and Hispanic school that was included this year on the state's list of persistently dangerous schools.Last week, in a small effort to reduce segregation, the department said it would allow seven schools to set aside seats for children from low-income or non-English speaking families.Follow The New York Times's Metro coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the New York Today newsletter.",0.0
Stores Told to Defend Supplement Assertions:   [National Desk ],,"The New York State attorney general's office issued subpoenas to four major retailers on Wednesday demanding that they provide evidence for a variety of health claims printed on the labels of the dietary supplements sold in their New York stores. The subpoenas were sent as part of an investigation into store-brand herbal supplements carried at Walgreens, Walmart, GNC and Target.The attorney general's office announced last week that it had conducted tests on 78 bottles of top-selling medicinal herbs at the four retailers and discovered that four out of five did not contain the ingredients advertised on their labels.The office said that the products appeared in many cases to contain powdered rice, wheat and ground-up houseplants.After a threat of legal action from the attorney general, the four retailers agreed to remove the products from New York shelves.A spokeswoman for New York's attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, declined to comment on the subpoenas. But a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation, who was not authorized to discuss the case, said the subpoenas demanded that the four retailers provide evidence of how they would prove the authenticity of their product claims.Ginkgo biloba supplements sold at Target, for example, carried a claim that the products supported ""concentration, memory and peripheral circulation, enhancing blood flow to the arms, legs and brain."" At GNC, a line of saw palmetto supplements promised to ""support healthy prostate function."" And Walmart's Spring Valley brand of echinacea supplements were promoted for ""healthy immune function.""Under a 1994 federal law, makers of supplements are allowed to make general health claims on their products, but they cannot imply that the products are able to prevent or treat disease. Companies are also required to identify all of the ingredients in a product on its label.A spokesman for Target said it had been in contact with the attorney general and would ""continue to cooperate.""GNC said it had provided test results demonstrating that its products were ""pure, safe and fully compliant."" A company spokeswoman added, ""The attorney general has refused to provide us access to his test results, and therefore we cannot comment on the allegations in this subpoena.""Walgreens, which removed the products nationwide, said in a statement, ""We take these issues very seriously,"" adding, ""We intend to continue cooperating.""Walmart said, ""Since the attorney general's office reached out on this issue, we have provided hundreds of pages in documents to answer the questions about the products.""",0.0
Trump's Take on de Blasio? 'The Worst Mayor in the U.S.':   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"Donald J. Trump tore into Mayor Bill de Blasio on Twitter on Friday, accusing New York City's top elected official of ""ineptitude"" and calling him ""the worst Mayor in the U.S., & probably the worst Mayor in the history of #NYC.""What took him so long?Mr. Trump -- the real estate mogul and Republican presidential candidate given to dismissing his critics as cowards, liars or worse -- has, it turns out, mostly held his tongue about Mr. de Blasio, a liberal Democrat and seemingly ripe target who resides two and a half miles from Trump Tower.The rebuke on Friday came after Mr. de Blasio, in a radio interview, called Mr. Trump a ""blowhard"" for supporting police surveillance of mosques.Mr. Trump, as he often does, responded with a post on Twitter that, three hours later, had been retweeted nearly 1,300 times: ""@BilldeBlasio should focus on running #NYC & all of the problems that he has caused with his ineptitude, & not be so focused on me!""Before that, there was little record of Mr. Trump, a connoisseur of the insult, directing his venom toward the mayor. In fact, in 2013, he predicted that Mr. de Blasio would ""end up being a good mayor, maybe a very good mayor.""This summer, when Mr. de Blasio criticized Mr. Trump's stance on immigration, and threatened to review the city's contracts with his affiliated companies, Mr. Trump responded rather formally, with a sternly worded letter to city officials. It was notably lacking in insults.Some in political circles speculated on Friday that Mr. Trump, as a force in the city's real estate industry, may have been reluctant to cross a man whose administration is his primary regulator.""He needs the Buildings Department, he needs the Fire Department, he needs various agencies to approve whatever project he has,"" George Arzt, a longtime political consultant, said. ""I wouldn't want to make fun of the mayor for that reason if I was a developer.""While Mr. Trump's name is a fixture of the skyline, his personal portfolio in New York is small. Privately, real estate executives said on Friday that he might have been motivated by a desire to protect the interests of his son-in-law, Jared C. Kushner, who is pursuing numerous projects around the city.Asked about Mr. Trump's remarks, a spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said only that they were in response to Mr. de Blasio's radio comments.The mayor, for his part, has gleefully criticized prominent Republicans in recent days. He singled out Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey for his views on Syrian refugees, saying the governor was acting ""un-American."" On Friday, referring to the terrorist group that staged the deadly attacks in Paris last week, Mr. de Blasio said that Mr. Trump was ""saying things that, bluntly, play right into ISIS' hands.""Roger J. Stone Jr., a Republican consultant and former adviser to Mr. Trump, said he was surprised by the developer's comments.""Can't imagine why Trump would attack de Blasio,"" Mr. Stone wrote in an email. ""De Blasio not well known (and therefore not yet hated) around the country.""Photograph Donald J. Trump in South Carolina On Friday, the Day He and Mayor Bill de Blasio Traded Barbs.

Syrian Town Where the Islamic State Was Repelled Now Strives to Rebuild:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KOBANI, Syria -- From the door of her modest breeze-block home, Faiza Mohammed recalled what her neighborhood once was and mourned what it had become.Her children's school has bullet holes in the walls and sandbags in the windows. The shops where she once bought groceries are mounds of rubble. The neighbors and relatives who used to live nearby and keep an eye on one another's children have left.Other than the elderly couple next door, she said, everyone is gone. Her house and theirs are the only two left on the street, islands in a sea of destruction.""We have people next door, so we are O.K.,"" said Ms. Mohammed, who was widowed before the Syrian civil war began. ""But at night we lock the door and don't open for anyone, because there is fear in the world.""A fierce battle by Kurdish fighters to repel an invasion by the Islamic State last year rocketed Kobani, an obscure border town in northern Syria, into the world's consciousness.But by the time the Kurds prevailed in January, backed by hundreds of American airstrikes in what was lauded as a model of international cooperation, the town looked as though an earthquake had struck it. Refugees who came back had trouble even locating their homes.Kobani, known in Arabic as Ain al-Arab, is trying now to overcome the deep scars of war and rebuild -- and there are signs of life.The challenges the town faces are huge, illustrating the huge toll of driving the Islamic State from urban areas, but also the costly burden of destruction that many Syrian cities will have to bear when the war ends.Around town, the crash of tractors tearing down damaged buildings resounds through the streets. Fleets of trucks haul off loads of rubble to dump outside the city in ever-expanding fields of waste.Shops selling cellphones, cigarettes and grilled chicken have reopened along a few commercial streets after installing new doors and glass. And thousands of displaced residents are returning each month, local officials say. Many have reclaimed their damaged homes, covering blown-out windows with plastic and plugging holes in walls with bricks to keep out the wind until real repairs can be made.""The city has become relatively suitable to live in again,"" said Idris Nassan, the head of foreign affairs for the area's new autonomous administration.When the battle ended, 80 percent of buildings were damaged and the infrastructure had collapsed, he said. The town had long before cut any links with the central government in Damascus, so local leaders formed the Kobani Reconstruction Board with members from the Kurdish diaspora to solicit aid and oversee rebuilding.Its first tasks were to restore water and sewage lines, reopen roads, dispose of unexploded ordnance and lay to rest the bodies of more than 100 people found in the rubble, Mr. Nassan said.Also destroyed were the city's new hospital, most government offices, a number of schools and bakeries, and two large wedding halls.Kobani sustained yet another blow in June, when Islamic State fighters dressed as anti-Assad rebels sneaked into town before dawn and went house to house, killing more than 250 people before Kurdish fighters killed them, according to Shervan Darwish, a military official here.But the administration has kept on, working with international organizations to open clinics and regulating generators so residents can buy a few hours of electricity per day.Its reconstruction efforts are restricted, however, by limited funds and the difficulty of obtaining building supplies.Although the town is near the Turkish border, Turkey has kept its crossings closed to most cargo -- a move widely seen as a strike against the area's Kurds.Many of Kobani's schools are damaged, but a number of them reopened last month, their courtyards filling twice a day with children doing exercises and heading to class. The early grades now use new Kurdish textbooks instead of the Syrian government's Arabic curriculum. It is unclear how regularly the teachers will be paid.""If there is a salary, of course no one would say no,"" said Shevin Mho, a teacher.The sprawling martyrs' graveyard outside town bears testament to the high human toll of the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. Hundreds of graves fill the site, the headstones of unidentified bodies bearing only numbers.On a rainy afternoon, a bereaved mother walked through the mud, screaming and yanking tufts of gray hair from her head while relatives tried to restrain her.Nearby, Badea Ali placed blue and red plastic flowers on the grave of her brother, Anwar, a Kurdish policeman who had been killed in a bomb attack. Ms. Ali said she had left Kobani for Iraq early in the war, then fled to Europe by boat last year and ended up in Germany.It had been painful to watch the battle for her hometown on the news in a strange country, but like many Kobani natives, the war had taught her to treasure the place, she said.""I started loving Kobani more than before because now we know its worth,"" she said.Her dream is to move back from Germany to open a hair salon, she said -- but not yet. ""The situation needs to settle down a bit,"" she said.The scale of the town's loss haunts many residents.Every morning, Muslim Mohammed, 56, returns to his damaged home and sits alone outside, drinking tea and thinking. The surrounding apartment buildings are all damaged and empty, now nesting grounds for birds.""I don't like to see a lot of people,"" said Mr. Mohammed, a mechanic. ""It is psychologically taxing.""He and his wife had fled to Turkey when the battle began, but three of his sons had joined the main Kurdish militia here.Ali, 17, was killed in battle, and Mohammed, 29, was shot dead during the Islamic State's incursion in June, Mr. Mohammed said. So he sent Ahmed, 15, to Europe by raft, hoping that distance might keep him alive.""Was I supposed to sacrifice all my sons?"" Mr. Mohammed said.Like many residents, he struggled to comprehend why the jihadists had poured so much into fighting for their town.""They didn't leave us anything,"" he said. ""Not our sons, our money, our homes.""Others, however, saw the victory as a large step toward empowerment for Syria's Kurdish minority after decades of governmental neglect. ""It was worth it,"" said Sherin Ismael, a 26-year-old seamstress. ""Now the world knows that there are Kurds.""Her family members, too, are the only residents left on their block, and her 2-year-old nephew, Osman, still cries at night, saying, ""ISIS is coming.""Some of their neighbors recently came to inspect their house and see what it would take to move back in.""Destruction comes quickly,"" Ms. Ismael said.

Arenas Hit Status Into the Cheap Seats:   [SpecialSections ],,"It wasn't long ago that fans at sporting events had only a handful of ticket options: Box seats, reserved seats and general admission seats, with perhaps a premium for the most desirable locations, like behind home plate or on the 50-yard line. Clubs and suites were often tucked into the ends of stadiums and the upper decks.But like airlines, hotels and other service providers, teams have increasingly sliced and diced their stadiums and arenas to generate more revenue by appealing to fans with ever more refined tastes and a craving for status. This trend has been driven in part by teams trying to extract as much money from fans for whom cost is no barrier, like the hedge fund managers and entertainers who pay thousands of dollars to sit, and be seen sitting, courtside at a basketball game.At the same time, teams are creating what they call ""premium experiences"" for fans in the least expensive corners of stadiums and arenas so they do not feel left out.""There is envy and class structure in every stadium,"" said Robert A. Boland, a professor of sports management at New York University. ""There are some consumers who want the access and proximity and will pay any price for it, so you want some areas that create exponential revenue. But you also want to create expectations and aspirations if you're a longtime fan and you can't afford what you're accustomed to.""Madison Square Garden, which last year completed a three-year, $1 billion renovation of ""the World's Most Famous Arena,"" provides a window into this phenomenon. Prices increased, but the number of new seating and club options exploded. Before the face-lift, the Knicks had 10 tiers of tickets priced from $30 to $3,000. Now, they have 29 price points between $49 and $3,700.Rangers fans can buy 27 levels of tickets, up from 14 before. The cheapest ticket fell $5 to $32, while the most expensive ticket rose $175, to $1,300.Before the renovation, suites were at the highest level of the arena. Now there are three levels of suites much closer to the action, a new lounge and club seats.Madison Square Garden is not shy about promoting its most expensive seats during every Knicks home game, when an announcer from the MSG Network interviews celebrities sitting courtside. But Howard Jacobs, the executive vice president for tickets, clubs and corporate hospitality, says that the vast majority of seats are far less expensive and that each area of the arena has novel features, like food courts, lounges and distinct views of the court or rink.""We saw the value in segmentation,"" Mr. Jacobs said. ""In many respects, it's a hospitality strategy. Just because you sit in the upper bowl doesn't mean it is not a premium experience.""Selling status can backfire if fans feel they have been priced out of the market. The New York Yankees were mocked in 2009 when their new stadium included tickets that cost $2,500 a game. Attendance has declined 8.5 percent since the new stadium opened. In 2010, as the Jets and Giants prepared to open their new stadium, the Jets slashed the price of their personal seat licenses, which entitle fans to buy season tickets, after blowback from longtime supporters. Fans who had waited years for Giants season tickets declined to buy them because they could not afford seat licenses that cost as much as $20,000.Teams are also segmenting their stadiums to confront another challenge: Drawing fans who can just as easily watch games at home on affordable high definition screens.Teams need fans in their seats and suites to generate income, but also to make the games look dramatic to viewers at home. They also know that attending a game is the best way for a fan to get hooked on a team.""Those kids that come out on game day, those are your future fans, and if you don't have that experience growing up, then the odds of you becoming emotionally attached is less,"" said Bill Johnson, senior vice president and design principal at HOK, a leading stadium designer. ""It's not about just making the revenue, but protecting the legacy of the game.""Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons, is wrestling with how to compete with television while convincing fans that attending games is affordable and unique. In the 71,000-seat stadium he plans to open in 2017, Mr. Blank wants to ensure that even the fans in the cheapest seats have an enticing enough experience so that they will leave their living rooms and come to the game.The stadium, which Mr. Johnson was involved in designing, will include a 360-degree five-story high-definition video board that will be visible to every fan; a 61,000-square-foot plaza for entertainment before and after the game; a 100-yard bar on the upper concourse with various food and beverage options; and a lounge with game-day content to appeal to fantasy football fans.At the same time, the stadium will include about 7,500 club seats and two ""ultraexclusive V.I.P. clubs,"" some with sideline access, parking and private entrances. While the number of premium seats is up, the total number of seats is down from 74,000 in the old stadium.""These stadiums are obviously getting more and more costly to build, but in my opinion you want to ensure that you have the same demographics within the stadium that you have in the greater community,"" Mr. Blank said. ""When you're watching something on television, you say to yourself that you were wish you were there and not on the couch.""Baseball teams face perhaps the biggest challenge getting fans because they have 10 times as many home games as football teams and many of them are played midweek and at night. So they are adding distinctive options to entice fans with different budgets. The Boston Red Sox, for instance, built a 35-person party suite adjacent to the Green Monster, the left field wall at Fenway Park, while the Washington Nationals have already sold out a new club with six private opera boxes.Teams in smaller, less affluent markets without the surfeit of big corporations and wealthy fans found in cities like Los Angeles and New York must promote affordable options. The Cleveland Indians built a two-story bar aimed at young professionals and expanded the children's clubhouse and family deck; both will open this season. The Arizona Diamondbacks sell about a third of their 67 suites on an annual basis for $130,000 to $170,000, not including food and beverages, less than half of what they would cost in New York. The rest are sold individually for up to $4,000 a game.Teams often maintain exclusivity by barring fans without a suite-level ticket from entering that level. But Derrick Hall, president of the Diamondbacks, took the opposite approach, allowing fans from other levels to walk through the suite deck to see what they could buy.""It piques their curiosity,"" Mr. Hall said. ""It's a dual strategy. Not everyone can afford it. But the trend has grown upward for fans to rent nightly instead of for a whole season.""The Diamondbacks do not market their most expensive tickets because wealthy fans will buy them anyway, he said, adding that it is better to market to fans to fill the rest of the stadium.""Even with our highest-priced seats, our renewal rate is near 100 percent,"" Mr. Hall said. ""Regardless of how we play, they're coming back.""Photograph Big Vision: Renderings of the Atlanta Falcons New Stadium, Clockwise From Top. An Aerial View.

East Timor: Opposition Figure Is Named Prime Minister:   [Brief ],,"East Timor's president has chosen an opposition party member, Rui Maria de Araújo, as the nation's new prime minister, his office announced Wednesday. Mr. Araújo, a former health minister, replaces Xanana Gusmão, who resigned last week ahead of an expected restructuring of the government. Party officials signaled that the cabinet was expected to be reduced to 34 members from 55 and would become more inclusive, with opposition figures among those appointed. East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was occupied by Indonesia in 1975. It voted in a referendum backed by the United Nations in 1999 to end the occupation, which left more than 170,000 dead, and it became a sovereign state in 2002. But the country has struggled to develop economically, and nearly half of its 1.2 million people live in poverty.",0.0
Link and Learn:   [Education Life Supplement ],,"College students increasingly view their time on campus as a hoop to jump through on their way to a job, yet many have no idea where they will land.While previous generations' career tracks were simple and mostly linear, now entire industries expand and contract at alarming speed. In this new world, government statistics move too slowly to capture employment dynamics. What jobs are available in a particular occupation? What type of experiences do I need to get a job in those professions? What did people who have those jobs study in college?As we live more of our lives online and use social media to update friends, family and colleagues on our job moves, much of what we need to know about the changing labor market is crowd sourced in real time. And many of those digital breadcrumbs end up in LinkedIn profiles.The online professional networking site knows where most of its members -- and there are more than 364 million of them worldwide -- went to college, what they studied, where they work and what they say their skills are.Over the last two years, this networking giant has been moving into the higher education industry, building an array of new tools for students in their search for a college and for a career. ""A lot of decisions in life are not based on perfect data,"" said Itamar Orgad, who leads LinkedIn's higher education product team at its sprawling headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. ""We are trying to optimize the data we have to better help the younger generation think about education and careers.""The interrelated search engines allow anyone to essentially reverse-engineer career paths of LinkedIn members by navigating the connections between their majors, schools and careers. While only as accurate as the profiles, the results are nonetheless addictive if you're interested in what people ended up doing with their English literature degree or where they worked before landing a great job at Google. Dive deep into profiles for details about members' lives, their skill sets, and how they are connected to other companies and people.Somewhat creepy? Perhaps. Useful to figuring out a career path? Maybe, although no two people are alike. Still, each click essentially draws a picture of the overlapping pathways that people do follow through their careers.The various search tools on linkedin.com/edu are part of LinkedIn's strategy to attract younger users, beginning in high school. In 2013, it lowered the required age of participants to 14 from 18; today, students are the network's fastest-growing segment of users.A handful of campuses have now partnered with LinkedIn to encourage students to use the site. Last spring at the University of California, Davis, representatives helped students build their profiles and a campus photographer took head shots for them to use online. Colleges themselves are using the service to find out where their alumni work.Of course, the promise of big data guiding career paths has its downside. Going to college has always been about exploration, an openness to serendipity that leads to majors and careers that students never considered before discovering a great class or landing an interesting internship. Following a trail suggested by data on other people's careers edits out the personal successes that come from carving out one's own way.AuthorAffiliation JEFFREY J. SELINGO Jeffrey J.

U.S. and Russia Back U.N. Vote on Chemical Attacks in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- The United States and Russia will support a United Nations Security Council resolution to identify the perpetrators of attacks using chlorine and other chemical agents in Syria, Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday.The agreement to back the resolution was reached Wednesday night in a one-on-one meeting here between Mr. Kerry and Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister.Diplomats at the United Nations said a vote on the resolution was scheduled for Friday.Although the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has the authority to determine whether chemical weapons have been used in Syria, the measure is intended to hold a specific organization or individuals to account.According to a draft of the resolution, a joint investigative panel of the O.P.C.W. and the United Nations would be established to identify ""individuals, entities, groups or governments who were perpetrators, organizers, sponsors or otherwise involved in the use of chemicals as weapons, including chlorine or any other toxic chemical"" in Syria.""What we are trying to do is get beyond the mere finding of the fact that it may have been used and actually find out who used it and designate accountability for its use,"" Mr. Kerry told reporters here.The United States and its allies have repeatedly charged that forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria have dropped chlorine-filled bombs from helicopters during the country's four-year civil war.The possession of chlorine is not banned by the international convention covering chemical weapons, although the use of chlorine as a weapon is banned. There are also concerns that Mr. Assad may not have given up all the chemical weapons he was required to hand over under a 2013 accord.Russia, however, has been a strong supporter of Mr. Assad, and differences between Washington and Moscow have held up the adoption of the measure.Mr. Kerry said the new resolution would establish a system for conducting investigations into whether chemical weapons were used, but he did not provide details.""What we will achieve, we believe, with this resolution is the creation of a mechanism which will actually enable us to do that,"" Mr. Kerry said.After Mr. Assad's forces were accused of using chemical weapons in the Damascus suburbs in August 2013, killing civilians and breaching President Obama's self-declared ""red line"" against the use of poison gas, the administration initially considered a military response.Mr. Obama shelved that threat after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia suggested that Mr. Assad might be persuaded to give up his stocks of poison gas.In September 2013, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov worked out a sweeping plan in Geneva to dismantle Syria's chemical arsenal, and the agreement was later endorsed by the Security Council.But Mr. Assad's apparent stocks of chlorine, critics say, have allowed him to maintain a rudimentary ability to use chemical agents.As Mr. Assad's position has weakened militarily in recent months, there have been increasing fears that he might make greater use of chlorine-filled bombs or even of weapons using other chemicals.Mr. Kerry said that he hoped a vote on the resolution would come soon. Referring to his meeting with Mr. Lavrov on Wednesday night, Mr. Kerry said that he and his Russian counterpart had ""talked about the U.N. resolution and indeed, I believe, reached an agreement that should try to see that resolution voted on shortly.""",0.0
"A Heavy Metal Affair, With Writerly Whispers and Bach, Too:   [Review ]",,"Complexions Contemporary Ballet, a company formed in 1994 by Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, has done what, for many midsize companies, remains impossible: It has lasted. But for a troupe named in honor of the multicultural makeup of its dancers, it remains distressingly bland. Where diversity also matters -- in its choreography -- is where this company falls short. No matter the mood or music, a sequence often repeats in Mr. Rhoden's pieces: After a running start, a dancer slides onto the stage, strikes an assertive pose and then -- as if trapped inside a force field -- shifts position by flicking a hip or tossing off a pirouette before retreating to the wings.This isn't dance for the stage, but for the camera; Mr. Rhoden choreographs in close-ups. On Tuesday, Complexions returned to the Joyce Theater with the first of three programs, including a premiere, to Metallica songs. With the exception of William Forsythe's ""Approximate Sonata,"" the dances are all by Mr. Rhoden, including ""Ballad Unto ...,"" set to Bach and originally choreographed for Tulsa Ballet. A work for 14 dancers who fade in and out of Michael Korsch's dewy lighting, this ballet, an exploration of facets of love, echoes Mr. Rhoden's narrow choreographic palette with several pas de deux. Interspersed between group sections, they draw on George Balanchine's neo-Classical aesthetic, but too often feel like parody.Still, there is the dancing of Ashley Mayeux, whose silken line and elegance sets her apart. In ""Cryin' to Cry Out,"" danced to Jimmy Scott, she performs a pas de deux with Andrew Brader, whose stellar partnering magnifies details, giving their pairing a sweetness and a naturalness. It was the one time Mr. Rhoden seemed to rise beyond his usual impulses and deliver something with a sense of humanity. In the solo ""Imprint/Maya,"" inspired by Maya Angelou, the dancer, again, is the key: Here, the veteran virtuoso Mr. Richardson remains crisp and spontaneous despite the forgettable material.The sad part about ""Strum,"" set to Metallica songs, is its tameness. Under red and yellow lights, again by Mr. Korsch, 15 dancers decked out in silver costumes by Christine Darch mimic the melodrama of the operatic rock music but never revel in it. Timothy Stickney, more manic than nimble, emerges as the main character -- dashing onto the stage, he whips his head with the fury, but it's all an act: He possesses little power of projection. What would Beavis and Butt-Head say? At least there was no air guitar.Complexions Contemporary Ballet performs through Nov. 29 at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, Manhattan; 212-242-0800; joyce­.org.Photograph Complexions Contemporary Ballet: Addison Ector, Center, and Members of This Company Performing ""Strum,"" a Premiere Choreographed by Dwight Rhoden and Set to Metallica Songs, at the Joyce Theater.

'The Statue of Liberty Must Be Crying':   Commentary,,"AS anti-refugee hysteria sweeps many of our political leaders, particularly Republicans, I wonder what they would have told a desperate refugee family fleeing the Middle East. You've heard of this family: a carpenter named Joseph, his wife, Mary, and their baby son, Jesus.According to the Gospel of Matthew, after Jesus' birth they fled to save Jesus from murderous King Herod (perhaps the 2,000-year-ago equivalent of Bashar al-Assad of Syria?). Fortunately Joseph, Mary and Jesus found de facto asylum in Egypt -- thank goodness House Republicans weren't in charge when Jesus was a refugee!The vote by the House of Representatives effectively to slam the door on Syrian refugees was the crassest kind of political grandstanding, scapegoating some of the world's most vulnerable people to score political points. As a woman named Maria Radford tweeted me after the vote, ""the Statue of Liberty must be crying with shame.""Yes, security is a legitimate concern. And, yes, we can't rule out the possibility that a terrorist will slip in with the refugees. Among refugees admitted to the U.S. since 9/11, there has been about one arrest for terrorism offenses for every 250,000 refugees, according to the Migration Policy Institute.Then again, by my back-of-the-envelope calculations there's maybe a 100-times greater likelihood that, say, a Floridian will turn out to be a murderer over a 10-year period than that a refugee will attempt terrorism. So if we're willing to allow Floridians free entry into other states, allowing Syrian refugees shouldn't be a problem.Let's be real: Refugee admission is the most deeply vetted pathway into the United States. Even for Iraqis who worked as translators for our military, risking their lives to keep Americans alive and enjoying strong support of American officers, vetting can take a couple of years.That's why the 9/11 attackers didn't enter the U.S. as refugees, but as students and tourists. If a terrorist group wants to attack America, it won't wait two years to try to infiltrate as refugees. It'll send people in as students or tourists, use fake or stolen U.S. or European passports, or just pay a human smuggler to take their terrorists across the border from Mexico or Canada.In any case, the Paris attackers identified so far were of French and Belgian nationality, not Syrian. One was carrying a Syrian passport, true, but it apparently wasn't his own and was perhaps meant to create an anti-Syrian backlash.The Islamic State's strategy is to create a wedge in the West between Muslims and non-Muslims. Whether that strategy succeeds depends on us: Will we clamp down with the harsh reaction the Islamic State sought?When we're fearful we make bad decisions. That was true around World War II, when we denied refuge to European Jews and interned Japanese-Americans. That was true after 9/11, when we invaded Iraq and engaged in torture.As George Takei, the Japanese-American actor who was interned for four years as a child, wrote in a Facebook post after the Paris attacks: ""There no doubt will be those who look upon immigrants and refugees as the enemy as a result of these attacks, because they look like those who perpetrated these attacks, just as peaceful Japanese-Americans were viewed as the enemy after Pearl Harbor. But we must resist the urge to categorize and dehumanize, for it is that very impulse that fueled the insanity and violence perpetrated this evening.""The demagoguery about refugees leaves me with an ache in the gut because, as I noted in my last column, I am the son of a refugee. Some 65 years ago, my Armenian/Polish/Romanian father was wandering Europe just as the Syrian refugees are today. Because Americans took a chance on him, I'm in a position to write this appeal for similar empathy today.Sure, some Syrians are terrorists, but some of the people I most admire in the world are Syrian doctors and ""White Helmets"" who help the victims of violence. House Republicans would block these heroes, would bar even the Yazidi and Christian victims of terrorists.Republican leaders say they simply want to tighten security to keep America safe. That's an echo of what American officials claimed in the late 1930s and early 1940s as they blocked the entry of Jewish refugees.Breckinridge Long, then a senior State Department official in charge of visas, warned that Nazi spies were trying to enter the U.S. as refugees. In the name of security, he established vetting rules so strict that few Jews could pass.""We can delay and effectively stop for a temporary period of indefinite length the number of immigrants,"" Long boasted in a 1940 memo. His callous security requirements led to the deaths of many tens of thousands of Jews.Yes, security was a legitimate concern then, as it is now, but security must be leavened with common sense and a bit of heart.To seek to help desperate refugees in a secure way is not naïveté. It's not sentimentality. It's humanity.AuthorAffiliation NICHOLAS KRISTOF I invite you to sign up for my free, twice-weekly newsletter.

Kings vs. Underdogs:   [Arts and Leisure Desk ],,"N.W.A., the group that brought gangster rap to the mainstream, angering conservatives and the F.B.I. along the way, burned hot and fast. The core group as it's remembered today -- Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, MC Ren, DJ Yella -- was together for only about two years, and in total the group lasted for maybe five, from the late 1980s to early '90s.But N.W.A. crammed several lifetimes into that short space, many -- but not all -- of which get airtime in the new biopic ""Straight Outta Compton,"" which opens on Aug. 14.Here we see the group members as fresh-faced Compton teenagers, as buddy collaborators and, eventually, as firebrands. What you don't see much of, though, is them as successful rap stars. Apart from a handful of scenes that show how quickly N.W.A. turned into an arena-worthy live act, and some flashes of the excess -- primarily wealth and women -- that came with their triumph, the group's most robust period is largely clouded here by other concerns.But the de-emphasis on the group's era of peak achievement is consistent with how Hollywood has long approached hip-hop. Like most of the hip-hop films before it, ""Compton"" does much better capturing the group -- and by extension, hip-hop -- as a product of struggle. Naturally, watching people overcome long odds thanks to their creative gifts has strong narrative impact. Everyone loves an underdog.But what about a king? When it comes to capturing hip-hop success -- the period that comes after the ascent -- Hollywood has been ambivalent at best. If hip-hop was still primarily an underdog story, this would be understandable, but the genre is at the center of pop culture, both commercially and aesthetically. It's minted several generations of stars. Film is maybe the last place it's infantilized.Excluding first-wave cash-in films like ""Beat Street"" and ""Krush Groove"" and also documentaries -- more on those later -- hip-hop films have fallen into roughly two categories. There are the biopics that purport to tell true stories, like ""Compton"" and ""Notorious,"" the 2009 retelling of the life of the Notorious B.I.G., who was killed in 1997; and the lightly fictionalized films in which actual artists' back stories are used as inspiration for original characters. Think of ""8 Mile,"" the 2002 film based on Eminem's early years, and ""Get Rich or Die Tryin',"" the 2005 film modeled after 50 Cent's origin story.All these films favor their subjects' years of initial struggle over their years in the spotlight. Take the romance associated with the written word, which runs through all of them. In ""Compton,"" a young Ice Cube obsesses over his rhyme notebook on the bus, while in ""8 Mile,"" Eminem's B. Rabbit does the same, scribbling on tattered sheets of paper at odd angles. Most of these films use lyric-writing as a means of overcoming a difficult situation -- in ""Get Rich"" it's childhood trauma, and also jail; in ""Notorious"" it's childhood teasing, and also jail.But N.W.A. was much more than that. It was among the first rap acts to focus lyrics strictly on violent, street life fantasy, and also the loudest in its protest of overzealous policing, including its 1988 single that spawned a vulgar catchphrase that persists to this day.But given the intensity of N.W.A.'s breakthrough, though, this narrow approach feels naïve. There's a clear tension between the two sections of ""Compton"": its heroic beginning, in which five unlikely stars climb their way to fame and infamy; and its protracted, staggering conclusion, packed thick with contract squabbles, Eazy-E's decline and death from AIDS-related complications in 1995 and maudlin reconciliations. The film skips uncomfortable chapters of the group's rise -- Dr. Dre's assault on the TV host Dee Barnes, accusation of racial insensitivity and homophobia in Ice Cube's ""Black Korea"" and ""No Vaseline"" -- in favor of the ones that make its members look like achieving underdogs, such as their public quarrel with the F.B.I. (""Notorious,"" by contrast, shows the Notorious B.I.G. being violent with two of the most important women in his life, Faith Evans and Lil Kim.)This is at least partly a reflection of who's doing the producing. You can feel the guiding hands of Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy-E's widow, Tomica Woods-Wright -- all executive producers -- each looking to boost post-N.W.A. reputations. ""Compton"" also capitulates to Hollywood's need for neat endings. Dr. Dre and Ice Cube are shown moving on to their next lucrative ventures: Dr. Dre departs Death Row in a principled fury and announces the name of his (troubled) new label, Aftermath; Ice Cube works on the script for ""Friday,"" the movie that would give him his first real foothold in Hollywood, now his home. Eazy-E's failing health and eventual death is used as a loud cautionary tale, and an opportunity for the formerly warring group members to find common ground.But ""Compton,"" a film about a spectacularly complex group, doesn't benefit from its Hollywood ending. It also doesn't help that this era has already been satirized in two films, ""CB4"" and ""Fear of a Black Hat"" -- richly, with both venom and love. That was also two decades ago, which means that for at least that long, the tropes of the era have been absorbed into the pop culture slipstream and no longer need to be sanitized.Still, for all its flaws, ""Compton"" is a rarity: a studio-produced hip-hop film, one with a budget of $29 million, according to The Hollywood Reporter. (That's $9 million more than ""Notorious,"" and roughly $11 to $12 million less than ""8 Mile"" or ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'."")In part, that's because the genre is young: Biopics typically focus on artists whose careers are complete, whether because of old age or death; plenty of hip-hop's first wave of megastars are still making music. There are also omnipresent issues around music rights. That means there are many great rap biopics yet to be made -- about Jay Z; Master P; Sean Combs; Lil Wayne and the Cash Money Records story; and Tupac Shakur (who's been given the documentary treatment).Any of those would demand a real reckoning with hip-hop success, though. Hip-hop has been an organic healing force, sure, but it's also a product and tool of capitalism. As recently as ""8 Mile,"" in 2002, a film about hip-hop could effectively skip mentioning its commercial potential. B. Rabbit, Eminem's character, isn't a rising star navigating the treacherous waters of new fame but a battle rapper in search of respect; he doesn't even quit his day job. In ""Get Rich,"" rap stardom is a goal but not achieved. 50 Cent is one of the most commercially successful rappers of the 2000s, but the film ends with his character, Marcus, removing his bulletproof vest onstage at a concert in his old stomping grounds, still lightyears away from fame.Unexpectedly, it's fallen to television to tackle hip-hop as an continuing, commercially successful art form. In 2003, there was the short-lived UPN series ""Platinum,"" and last year came ""Empire,"" the breakout primetime soap opera, which collapsed oodles of familiar rap narratives into one, rummaging through the genre's history at breakneck speed for inspiration. Television isn't above excavating the genre's innocent past, too. Baz Luhrmann is spearheading ""The Get Down"" for Netflix, about a crew of South Bronx teenagers at the birth of hip-hop, and VH1 recently filmed ""The Breaks,"" an original movie-cum-backdoor pilot -- inspired by ""The Big Payback,"" Dan Charnas's detail-packed hip-hop history book -- set in 1990, just at the dawn of hip-hop's commercial explosion.And sometimes, hip-hop success manifests itself in unexpected film choices. Only a group at the height of its powers could have survived ""Tougher Than Leather,"" the bizarre 1988 Run-DMC movie notable mainly for Rick Rubin's role as a bigoted criminal who giddily uses racial epithets. The film is also, in many ways, the seed of the Rapsploitation movement of low-budget, straight-to-VHS movies, a mode refined by Master P in the late 1990s with his No Limit Films. That shingle released clunky but engaging gangster flicks -- ""I'm Bout It,"" ""MP Da Last Don"" and more -- usually paired with album releases on No Limit Records. (Eventually, No Limit released films in movie theaters, but none as amusing or raw.) Rather than make films about hip-hop, Master P used his emerging celebrity and financial clout to remake himself as a multimedia mogul, a more interesting choice than those made by most rappers who would rather be immortalized in films than make them.By the late 2000s, digital documentation was becoming standard, so it shouldn't be a surprise that two of the most revealing and provocative hip-hop films have been recent documentaries. Michael Rapaport filmed A Tribe Called Quest on a 2008 tour, a decade after its final album, and captured a group in perennial distress. The resulting 2011 film, ""Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest,"" is both reverent and distressingly unvarnished, taking the group's importance largely as a given and letting the members' disagreements steer the narrative.That film captures a great hip-hop group well past its peak. Even more striking and revealing is ""The Carter,"" from 2009, directed by Adam Bhala Lough and capturing Lil Wayne at the height of his drug-addled productivity and popularity, releasing endless numbers of songs online for free and selling one million copies of his album ""Tha Carter III"" in its first week. In between recording his outrageously dexterous rhymes, Lil Wayne is a cipher; he watches ESPN, sips syrup and never sits for a formal interview. It's a little like watching Nero fiddle just before Rome begins to burn.In an age of perpetually running cameras, the possibility of an honest, robust, glamour-and-warts hip-hop film only increases. And in a way, one already exists: ""Tupac: Resurrection,"" the impressionistic 2003 posthumous documentary narrated almost wholly in Mr. Shakur's own words, much like ""Amy,"" the recent Amy Winehouse documentary. Mr. Shakur was one of the great hip-hop provocateurs, a charismatic musician and also a savvy actor. He was tender and tough. He was constantly renegotiating his public self, drawing people in and then pushing them away.And because of his popularity, he was forever on camera. This film was made in partnership with MTV and relied heavily on interviews, especially from the years when Mr. Shakur was beset with legal issues. A clear child of N.W.A. who also understands the art of persuasion, he speaks frankly -- about his upbringing, about his unlikely ascent, about the bad choices he made along the way, and about things that wouldn't fully reveal themselves to be bad choices until after his murder, in 1996. His candor and charm make for a film that understands hip-hop not just as a means of overcoming struggle, but also a place of easy thrills, a war zone that poses danger to its heroes, and a world without neat endings.Photograph The Fictional N.W.A.

Woman Killed in French Police Raid Had Unlikely Path to Extremism:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. LONDON -- When about 100 heavily armed police officers and soldiers took position shortly after 4 a.m. Wednesday outside the building in the Paris suburb of St.-Denis where the presumed ringleader of the Paris attacks was holed up, a young woman appeared in a window.""Help!"" she shouted, according to the reports of witnesses. ""Help me!""But Hasna Aitboulahcen, a cousin of Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the Islamic State jihadist believed to have orchestrated France's deadliest terrorist attacks to date, did not fool the officers, who suspected a trap. Two hours and 5,000 rounds of ammunition later, this 26-year-old daughter of a Moroccan immigrant was dead, in the end not by becoming the first woman to blow herself up in a suicide vest on Western soil, as first suggested by the authorities -- but by being killed in a fierce battle with the police.Ms. Aitboulahcen has been widely portrayed in the news media as a onetime wild child, at least by fundamentalist Muslim standards: smoking, drinking, staying out late, wearing cowboy hats, having lots of boyfriends and rarely going to the mosque. A widely circulated photograph shows her lying in a bubble bath, smiling coquettishly at the camera. In short, she seemed to be the thoroughly secular antithesis of how the pious Islamic State expects its women to behave.""She drank alcohol and went to nightclubs,"" said the son of one neighbor, who said he had not seen her in a while.But others, interviewed Friday in her old neighborhood, say that image was seriously out of date. Neighbors in the building where her mother lived and Ms. Aitboulahcen spent time intermittently, in the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, said the daughter had recently been wearing a face-covering veil outside the house. ""She was very respectful,"" said one woman, who recalled first seeing Ms. Aitboulahcen last summer. ""May God have mercy on her, whatever she did."" The woman declined to give her name for reasons of privacy.On a now-defunct social media account, Ms. Aitboulahcen apparently posted a photo of herself in full Muslim garb in June, French and Belgian news organizations reported, and wrote, ""Soon I will go to Syria, God willing.""She never made it there. But in the Wednesday morning raid in which Mr. Abaaoud and one other person also died and eight were captured, Ms. Aitboulahcen was said to have been the first one to open fire, with a Kalashnikov rifle. The authorities in Paris confirmed late on Friday night that forensic analysis had shown that it had not been Ms. Aitboulahcen who had donned a suicide belt in the face of the onslaught, but a third person, whose badly mangled body has not yet been identified.A tense exchange, captured on a neighbor's video around 5 a.m., preceded a battle of uninterrupted gunfire that would last for almost an hour.""Where is your boyfriend?"" an officer shouted.""He's not my boyfriend,"" Ms. Aitboulahcen shouted back.Seconds later the crack of an explosion rocked the building. Part of the third floor collapsed.A childhood friend who gave her name as Khemissa told a newspaper, Le Parisien, that she was shaken and saddened by the transformation of someone she had gone to school with and described as close.""She was not the kind of girl who blows herself up,"" said Khemissa, who declined to give her last name. ""She was a little crazy and loved life, made the most of life. She went through a bad patch and was influenced by these murderers.""Ms. Aitboulahcen's brother, who withheld his first name, said his sister radically changed over the past six months, though he questioned the sincerity of her religiosity. ""She was unstable,"" he told RTL radio. ""She fabricated her own bubble. In no way did she want to study her religion. I never saw her open a Quran."" Her mother said she had been ""brainwashed.""It is still not clear what role Ms. Aitboulahcen played in Mr. Abbaoud's Islamic State cell. Was she a part of a fourth suicide team, aimed at the moneyed towers of La Défense, the business district on the western edge of Paris, or Charles DeGaulle Airport, as the French police have hinted?Investigators are ruling nothing out. But it would have been a striking departure from Islamic State strategy and ideology so far if she were a commando.ISIS actively courts women as wives, mothers, recruiters and sometimes online cheerleaders of violence. Those who make it to Syria sometimes receive military training for defensive purposes. But they are barred from combat. Unlike other Islamist groups from Chechnya to Nigeria, including Al Qaeda in Iraq, the Islamic State has not used women as suicide bombers (the closest they got was a man dressed in women's garb).Instead, officials and terrorism experts say, Ms. Aitboulahcen was more likely to have been in charge of logistical support, organizing the safe house where she died and, by her mere presence, making the men look less suspicious.That Ms. Aitboulahcen was not a suicide bomber may prove irrelevant in the long run, experts say.""She is a martyr in their eyes,"" said Katherine Brown, a lecturer in the Defense Studies department of King's College London who specializes in female Muslim violence. The Islamic State is unlikely to pass up this opportunity to exploit her dramatic death, she said.It would not be the first time. Before a Jordanian pilot was filmed being burned alive in January this year, ISIS was demanding the release of a prisoner, Sajida al-Rishawi, an Iraqi woman whose suicide bomb failed to go off during a 2005 attack in Amman. The group called her a ""sister,"" said Sasha Havlicek, co-founder and chief executive of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a counterterrorism policy group that monitors female ISIS-affiliated social media accounts.And when Hayat Boumeddiene, the girlfriend of Amedy Coulibaly, an accomplice of the Charlie Hebdo attackers, managed to escape to Syria, the Islamic State's in-house magazine Dabiq praised her in a lengthy interview.Ms. Aitboulahcen was a fan. On Aug. 3, she posted a new profile picture on her Facebook page featuring Ms. Boumeddienne with a crossbow.In many ways, Ms. Aitboulahcen's life story mirrors that of the male members of her terrorist cell. She had a modest upbringing as the child of immigrants in a sometimes hostile society and fell into petty crime. The local police had a file on her for drug peddling.One of four children, she was born in the northern Paris suburb of Clichy-la-Garenne, a heavily immigrant neighborhood. Her upbringing appears to have been troubled. The parents split up early and all four siblings are believed to have spent some time in foster care. Her father moved to Creutzwald, the mayor of the town, Jean-Luc Wozniak, said, but Ms. Aitboulahcen appears to have lived mostly with her mother in the Paris suburbs.She was 16 when immigrant neighborhoods across the country erupted in a monthlong outburst of rioting in 2005.Neighbors told the mayor that she had spent the summer of 2011 in Creutzwald but had not been seen there recently. The father, who was born in Marrakesh and came to France in 1973 to work at a car factory, left for Morocco in July.It is unclear what triggered Ms. Aitboulahcen's radicalization. She was close in age to Mr. Abaaoud, a 28-year-old Belgian-Moroccan whose mother is the sister of Ms. Aitboulahcen's mother, officials confirmed.Investigators presume that Mr. Abaaoud, who is believed to have risen through the ranks of the Islamic State in part because he proved his aptitude in recruiting volunteer fighters in Europe, lured his cousin into the ISIS orbit, just as he had drawn in his younger brother Younes last year.If Ms. Aitboulahcen's role in the Paris attacks was to help keep the ringleader and a possible fourth attack team safe, it did not work out that way. In the end, it was her cellphone -- traced to the safe house -- along with a sighting of Mr. Abaaoud that helped lead investigators to the third-floor apartment in the suburb of St.-Denis, officials said.""She was the weak link,"" said one official close to the investigation.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"With Early Outburst, Rays End Mets', and Syndergaard's, Dominant Stretch:   [Sports Desk ]",,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Amid the clang of cowbells, Noah Syndergaard stalked off the mound, his face buried in his glove and hanging toward the ground.The Tampa Bay Rays had just pasted Syndergaard, an imposing 22-year-old pitcher for the Mets, for four runs in the first inning. He walked to the dugout soberly.Syndergaard, who in his previous nine starts was 4-1 with a 1.80 E.R.A., struggled uncharacteristically as the Mets fell, 5-4, to the Rays at Tropicana Field on Saturday. The loss broke the Mets' seven-game winning streak and cut their lead in the National League East to one and a half games.""Wasn't really sure what was going on in the first inning,"" Syndergaard said. ""It was kind of like a merry-go-round.""The Mets, who had been finding ways to win during their Florida trip, were afflicted not by the problem that had hurt them for much of the season -- no offense to aid their dominant pitching -- but by the opposite one, especially in the first inning.""Offense did their part,"" said Syndergaard, whose record on the road dropped to 0-5. ""I just wasn't able to uphold my end of the bargain.""On the second pitch of the game, Curtis Granderson hammered a fastball over the center-field wall for his sixth leadoff home run of the season. Daniel Murphy followed with a deep double, and Yoenis Cespedes with an opposite-field single. Lucas Duda then scored them both with a double to center field.Eight pitches in, the Mets' four batters had nearly combined for the cycle, and the team led, 3-0.In many games this season, three runs, let alone three first-inning runs, would have seemed like a luxury -- and would have provided ample offense for the Mets' starting pitcher. But in many games this season, the Mets' starting pitcher was not rocked for four runs in the first inning.Syndergaard's troubles started with the first batter, John Jaso, who pumped a ground-rule double to center field. Grady Sizemore then launched a two-run homer to right field, and the Rays had life. Syndergaard punched his glove and let out a deep breath.""Right down the middle,"" Mets Manager Terry Collins said of Syndergaard's pitch to Sizemore.After Syndergaard struck out Evan Longoria with a curveball, he gave up four singles and two runs. Mets reliever Sean Gilmartin started warming up.""I got a little too fastball happy,"" Syndergaard said. ""If I had mixed in a couple more off-speed pitches, that weak contact would have turned into outs, or swings and misses.""Finally, Curt Casali -- the ninth batter of the inning, who Collins said would have been Syndergaard's last of the game -- grounded a curveball to Syndergaard, who picked it up and tossed it to first base, mercifully ending the inning. Syndergaard had thrown 38 pitches and had given up six hits and the Mets' lead.""With them coming back with a four-spot, that's huge,"" Rays starter Nathan Karns said of his team's offense. ""It just puts me right back in the game.""Syndergaard said he had felt fine before the game and had not expected to struggle.""After warming up in the bullpen, I thought I was going to go nine scoreless,"" he said.Collins added: ""You saw the good fastball, but you didn't see the location. He just didn't have his command.""The four runs Syndergaard allowed in the first inning were the most he had given up in any full start since June 20 and deviated from his recent strong form: a dazzling Sunday night performance against the Washington Nationals that punctuated an emphatic sweep; eight shutout innings against the San Diego Padres, a game in which he carried a perfect game into the seventh; a 13-strikeout tour de force about a month ago.But perhaps the most damaging run came not in the first inning but in the fourth, when Longoria hit a sharp ground ball to shortstop Ruben Tejada with two outs and Jaso on third base. Tejada clutched the ball a few times before firing to first. Longoria beat the throw, and Jaso scored. That gave the Rays the lead again, and they held it for the rest of the game. Tejada said it was a play he should have made.""If Ruben doesn't double-clutch, he throws him out,"" Collins said. ""Just couldn't get the ball out of his glove. That happens.""Syndergaard, relieved after the fourth inning, allowed eight hits and five runs while striking out six. He threw 98 pitches.Before the game, Collins said he had noticed that Matt Harvey and Jacob deGrom had been affected by the emotional series against the Nationals last weekend, that it had taken a lot out of them during their starts on this trip. The intensity ""beats you down a little bit,"" Collins said, adding that it might happen to Syndergaard as well.But then he expressed hope.""I don't even know what's going to happen; this guy may pitch a no-hitter tonight,"" Collins said of Syndergaard. ""Who knows?""By the time Syndergaard walked off the mound at the end of the first inning, Collins knew.INSIDE PITCHCurtis Granderson, who had two home runs, hit a foul ball off his right ankle in the ninth inning. Granderson, hobbling in the clubhouse after the game, said it would not require X-rays. Terry Collins said Granderson would be evaluated on Sunday.Photograph Curtis Granderson Homered in the Top of the First, but the Rays Scored Four Runs in the Bottom.

The Uber-ization of Activism:   Commentary,,"The nasty battle between Uber and the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio over New York City's proposed cap on livery vehicles has ended, at least for now, with the city and the ride-hailing giant agreeing to postpone a decision pending a ""traffic study."" There's no doubt who won, though. The mayor underestimated his opponent and was forced to retreat.It wasn't just conventional pressure -- ads, money, lobbying -- that caught the mayor off guard. Uber mobilized its customers, leveraging the power of its app to prompt a populist social-media assault, all in support of a $50 billion corporation. The company added a ""de Blasio's Uber"" feature so that every time New Yorkers logged on to order a car, they were reminded of the mayor's threat (""NO CARS -- SEE WHY"") and were sent directly to a petition opposing the new rules. Users were also offered free Uber rides to a June 30 rally at City Hall. Eventually, the mayor and the City Council received 17,000 emails in opposition. Just as Uber has offloaded most costs of operating a taxi onto its drivers, the company uses its customers to do much of its political heavy lifting.Uber's earlier strategy to win entry into the Portland, Ore., market followed a similar pattern. When the city wasn't allowing the company to operate taxis, Uber exploited rules that allowed it to act as a delivery company, and distributed free ice cream around town. Using data on these deliveries, the firm shrewdly recruited recipients as pro-Uber citizen lobbyists, pressuring local officials to allow their cars to pick up passengers. It worked.Many tech firms now recognize the organizing power of their user networks, and are weaponizing their apps to achieve political ends. Lyft embedded tools on its site to mobilize users in support of less restrictive regulations. Airbnb provided funding for the ""Fair to Share"" campaign in the Bay Area, which lobbies to allow short-term housing rentals, and is currently hiring ""community organizers"" to amplify the voices of home-sharing supporters. Amazon's ""Readers United"" was an effort to gain customer backing during its acrimonious dispute with the publisher Hachette. Emails from eBay prodded users to fight online sales-tax legislation.So it's reasonable to ask whether there's still a bright line between being a business and being a campaign organization, or between consumer and activist. Tech companies' customers may think they are being served. But they are often the ones providing the service.To be sure, in the clash with Mr. de Blasio, Uber also deployed traditional public relations tools: TV ads, robocalls, mass mailings, celebrity endorsements and political operatives like David Plouffe, the former Obama strategist who now sits on Uber's board and serves as a ""strategic adviser."" Recent estimates indicate that even without counting its army of municipal strategists, Uber now retains over a third more state lobbyists than Walmart.But traditional methods will get you only so far in today's political-advocacy environment. Hence the new preference for what I call ""grass-roots for hire,"" where companies and interest groups galvanize their own users as unpaid campaigners, all with the tap of an app.These practices are redefining what it means to take part in politics. Social-media platforms were briefly perceived as democratizing tools, engendering transparency and empowerment in the digital age. But these new protest-on-demand movements blur the distinction between genuine citizen organizing and what often is called ""astroturf"": participation that looks grass roots but actually isn't, because it's been orchestrated to benefit a well-heeled patron.This Uberization of activism allows corporate sponsors to call the tune: Consider how for-profit colleges leaned on vulnerable students for political pressure, how Comcast enlisted its philanthropic beneficiaries to support the Time Warner merger or the way that the beverage industry hired protesters to oppose soda taxes.Technology may be neutral, but grass roots should mean bottom up, not top down. The #blacklivesmatter movement is a genuine grass-roots civil rights campaign, mobilized through social media. So is the environmentalist Bill McKibben's 350.org, with its blend of online organizing, social media strategy and in-person campaigning around climate change. But Uber's corporate populism is not. We should learn to recognize the difference.AuthorAffiliation EDWARD T. WALKER Edward T.

Cuomo Rejects U.S. Plan to Lend Money for Tunnels:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"When it comes to paying for new train tunnels under the Hudson River, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wants the federal government to send, not lend, money to New York.Mr. Cuomo made that position clear in a letter he sent on Friday to the federal transportation secretary, Anthony Foxx. The governor said that the Transportation Department's offer to extend a loan to build the tunnels was ""not viable,"" and he urged Mr. Foxx ""to obtain actual funding from the administration or from Congress.""The response from Mr. Cuomo was his second since Mr. Foxx sent a letter on July 27 to Mr. Cuomo and New Jersey's governor, Chris Christie, inviting them to meet with him to devise a plan for a new rail crossing of the Hudson. Last week, the governors indicated that the project would require billions of dollars from the federal government.In a statement on Friday night, Suzanne Emmerling, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Department, acknowledged that it would be difficult to complete the project, but that the alternative would be much worse.""We're willing to go to extraordinary lengths to help move this project forward using existing federal resources,"" she said. ""If there are tools we need from Congress, we're willing to consider joining regional leadership to get them. But all of that is predicated on getting to yes on an approach, and we remain committed to doing so as long as the region is.""Nicole Sizemore, a spokeswoman for Mr. Christie said, ""The State of New Jersey and New York are committed to ensuring their taxpayers will not be forced to cover the cost of the project in the absence of significant federal funding.""The two passenger train tunnels between New York City and New Jersey are more than 100 years old, and their owner, Amtrak, has said that they need to be overhauled after being flooded by Hurricane Sandy. But shutting either of them for an extended period would cripple the region's transportation network and leave tens of thousands of commuters seeking alternative ways to get into and out of the city.Amtrak has proposed building two one-track tunnels to supplement the existing tubes. That project, known as Gateway, has been estimated to cost as much as $14 billion, Mr. Cuomo said. So far, Amtrak has committed about $300 million to get the project started, but none of the remaining funding has been arranged.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, and Mr. Christie, a Republican, have indicated that their states are willing to contribute to the project, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which the governors jointly control, has pledged to serve as an active partner in getting the tunnels built.Securing a large sum from the federal government may have been complicated by Mr. Christie's cancellation in 2010 of an earlier plan to build a train crossing. That project, which was known as ARC, had received commitments of $3 billion each from the federal government and the Port Authority. Mr. Christie later redirected the authority's money to other transportation projects in New Jersey.Mr. Christie said the ARC project placed an unfair share of the cost on New Jersey.Last month, Mr. Christie, who is running for president, said in a radio interview that if he were president, he would call together his transportation secretary and the governors of the two states and tell them that ""if we're all going to put in an equal share, then let's go build these tunnels under the Hudson River.""In an interview with NY1 on Friday, Mr. Cuomo said that there had been a number of meetings with federal officials.""The funding help turns out to be a loan,"" he said. ""We don't need a loan. Thank you, but no thank you.""",0.0
"My Little Pony and Transformers Toys Help Lift Hasbro Sales, and Its Profit Jumps:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"Strong sales of Transformers action figures, My Little Pony products and other licensed toys helped Hasbro's revenue rise 5 percent last year, despite negative currency fluctuations and broader industry woes.The company said on Monday that its adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter rose to $154.9 million, or $1.22 a share, up from $148.8 million, or $1.12 a share, in the same period last year. The company's shares closed up more than 7 percent on Monday, at $59.66.As children have increasingly favored digital toys and games, big toymakers have struggled to compete with smaller, nimble upstarts to create new products.International markets have become increasingly important to Hasbro, which has bolstered its foreign operations in recent years. Last year, overseas sales of $2.02 billion made up nearly half of Hasbro's total revenue and increased 8 percent from 2013. By comparison, revenue in the United States and Canada rose just 1 percent to $2.02 billion in 2014.But the strength of the United States dollar created unfavorable currency fluctuations for the company.While Hasbro's revenue grew 5 percent to $4.28 billion in 2014, it would have grown 7 percent if not for changes in foreign exchange rates.Net revenue increased 1 percent to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, but would also have risen 7 percent, excluding a $75.4 million negative impact from currency fluctuations.Adjusted net earnings rose 10 percent to $408.7 million, or $3.15 earnings a share, in 2014.Hasbro's results come after Mattel reported bleak financial results for the fourth quarter. Hasbro has done a good job of navigating some of the industry's problems, like a decline in demand for traditional toys, especially those for younger children, said Sean McGowan, an analyst with Needham & Company.""They've got a better portfolio of licensed brands,"" Mr. McGowan said.Mr. McGowan credited sales of Transformers action figures internationally, for example, for helping to increase revenue in emerging markets by 20 percent, to $689.8 million.On a call, Brian D. Goldner, Hasbro's president and chief executive, credited the strength of the company's Transformers and My Little Pony franchises, as well as a spike in boys' toys over all, with helping sales last year.Hasbro is also sitting on a potential windfall from some of its new licensing agreements, a major focus for the company.Hasbro won the rights to make toys based on some of Disney's princess characters beginning in 2016, and Mr. Goldner said that the company's entertainment and licensing segments posted their highest annual revenue ever last year.Hasbro will also introduce toys based on this year's latest installment of ""Star Wars,"" the toy industry's most anticipated film in a year crowded with big Hollywood movies.While Hasbro toys for films including ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" ""Jurassic World"" and ""Fantastic Four"" will hit shelves between four and eight weeks before the films' release, consumers will begin to see some ""Star Wars"" products beginning in September, and then more film-related products closer to the movie's December premiere, Mr. Goldner said.Some of Hasbro's growth was offset by a 4 percent decline in sales of preschool products, including Playskool and Sesame Street brands, last year.Sales also declined for Furby, a cuddly talking creature that Hasbro revamped in 2012.Shipping delays at some of California's ports required Hasbro to account for higher shipping costs, but Mr. Goldner said he did not expect the impact of the strikes to be significant in 2015.Photograph Two Men in Transformer Costumes in Beijing.

The Professor on Lee Child's Shoulder:   [Op-Ed ],,"THE tough-guy hero Jack Reacher first appeared 18 years ago in Lee Child's novel ""Killing Floor."" On Sept. 1, 2014, Mr. Child started writing ""Make Me,"" the 20th in his best-selling Reacher series. But for once he was not alone in his office in Manhattan. He was being observed by Andy Martin, a longtime Reacher fan and University of Cambridge lecturer, sitting a few feet behind him and shadowing the creative process all the way from the first word (""Moving"") to the last (""needle"").While Mr. Child was writing, Mr. Martin was simultaneously writing about him writing, typically for several hours a day.The bare-bones plot of ""Make Me"": A big guy called Keever is buried using a backhoe; Reacher gets off a train in the town of Mother's Rest; a mysterious woman is waiting for him (or is she?) at the station; the town is visited by death and destruction.In a recent conversation, the authors reflected on their cheek-by-jowl arrangement, beginning with a progress report on Mr. Child's current novel.>Lee Child Listen to this: ""In the morning they gave Reacher a medal, in the afternoon they sent him back to school."" The first sentence of ""Night School."" What do you think? I started writing it on September 1, as usual. And I turned around ... and you weren't there. Weird. I wanted to discuss the comma. The balance of the sentence. Should it be ""and""? I'll have to get back in the habit of talking to myself. Instead of you.>Andy Martin Hold on. Eleven syllables, each side of the caesura. Diminished alexandrine. Nicely symmetrical. And that rhythm. Like a limerick. Did you know you were doing that?>CHILD See, I'll miss all that.>MARTIN I know. It's like the end of a romance. There's one immigration guy convinced I was having an affair. Wanted to know why I kept coming back to New York. I said I wasn't working, it was just pleasure. How was it for you?>CHILD The earth didn't move. Except when the subway went by under the building. I'm used to having a housekeeper knocking around the apartment. It's similar. And you had a knack of getting out just before I started to feel physically oppressed. I mean, I understood why you wanted to do it, but sometimes I thought, why me?>MARTIN It could have been almost anyone. In theory. Maybe not Donna Tartt -- too slow! But you were willing. I liked your economy of style -- very degree zero. I'm still trying to work out why you let me do it, though. I used to think it was something to do with an aging boxer wanting a spectator for his last big fight. Or maybe a magician who finally decided to twitch aside the curtain and say, ""O.K., come back here and see how it's done."">CHILD Do you ever think there is something crazy about writing 20 books about the same guy?>MARTIN Well, no crazier than 19, I suppose.>CHILD That's why I did it. I thought it would make a change. I've been writing about Reacher for 20 years. I never had anyone watch me do it before. And it was a world first. A mad experiment. Literary criticism, but in real time. You were a wild card. What was the worst that could happen?>MARTIN I was sitting about two yards behind you while you tapped away. Trying to keep quiet. I could actually make out a few of the words. ""Nothingness"" I remember for some obscure reason. And ""waterbed."" And then I kept asking questions. I couldn't help myself. How? Why? What the...? Oh surely not! A lot of people thought I would destroy the book.>CHILD Here is the fundamental reality about the writing business. It's lonely. You spend all your time writing and then wondering whether what you just wrote is any good. You gave me instant feedback. If I write a nicely balanced four-word sentence with good rhythm and cadence, most critics will skip right over it. You not only notice it, you go and write a couple of chapters about it. I liked the chance to discuss stuff that most people never think about. It's weird and picayune, but obviously of burning interest to me.>MARTIN And the way you care about commas -- almost Flaubertian! I tried to be a kind of white-coated detached observer. But every observer impinges on the thing he is observing. Which would be you in this case. And I noticed that everything around you gets into your texts. You are an opportunistic writer. For example, one day the maid was bumping around in the kitchen and in the next line you used the word ""bucket."" Another time there was some construction work going on nearby and the next verb you used was ""nail."" We go to a bookstore and suddenly there is Reacher, in a bookstore.>CHILD You're right, that's my method. Like the thing with the bucket. In one ear, straight to the page.>MARTIN The funny thing is you are clearly a frustrated academic. For starters, you have officially seen ""Waiting for Godot"" 39 times. And you are good at the professorial analysis, be it of Shakespeare's ""stony limit"" (""Romeo and Juliet"") or your own lexis. Onomatopoeia and all that. At a certain point I started to feel de trop. All I had to do was quote you.>CHILD I believe it was Kant who said something like, Newton knew what he was doing and could take you back through the steps logically, whereas Homer had no idea and couldn't possibly explain it either. I sort of thought: Maybe I can explain it, I've been doing it long enough. Lots of readers ask me how I do this or that. I thought this was an opportunity to tell them. Or at least to figure it out for myself. Which was the main thing, to be honest. Normally I operate in a fog of instinct. I wondered if being required to explain as I went along might actually be more illuminating for me than you.>MARTIN That was the thing that drew me in: You never knew in advance what you were going to be writing about. It was a real tabula rasa. You really were making it up as you went along. I can certify that. I remember what you said when we started off down this road. ""I have no plot and no title."" No plan, no notes, no synopsis.>CHILD The beginning of a new book feels like stepping off a cliff into the abyss. A long free-fall. One of these days I'm going to end up flat on my face. Or not, as the case may be.>MARTIN Sublime confidence. And no rules.>CHILD Elmore Leonard had rules. Made to be broken. ""Never use an adverb."" Never is an adverb! If you want to start with, ""It was a dark and stormy night,"" go for it. I mean, suppose it really was a dark and stormy night? What are we supposed to do? Lie?>MARTIN Do you think you learned anything from watching me watch you for a year?>CHILD Well, I learned that line about Kant and Newton and Homer, that was one of yours, so thanks to Cambridge for that. It was like having a coach in baseball or tennis -- you're forced to reflect on what you're doing, and maybe therefore you do it better. And certainly I think ""Make Me"" came out well. Was there cause and effect? Maybe. After this I reckon every writer is going to want a meta-book to go with their book -- a boxed set.
