MILITARIZED INTERSTATE EVENTS (MIE) CODING INSTRUCTIONS
========================================================

GOAL: Identify every threat, display, and use of force by one country's forces against another country's forces, 2015-2024

OVERVIEW
--------
We have collected newspaper articles based on Boolean searches for likely MIE matches. The Boolean search produces mostly false positives, so we have culled articles to stories very likely to describe threats, displays, and/or uses of force.

STEP ONE: IS THERE AN MIE IN THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE?
===================================================

Requirements for MIE existence (from Jones, Bremer, and Singer, 1996):

1. INTERSTATE SYSTEM MEMBERS
   - Militarized incident must occur among, and be explicitly directed towards, one or more interstate system members
   - Actions between system member and non-system member forces are excluded
   - Exception: If another system member undertakes militarized action or diplomatically protests actions against a non-system member, a militarized incident between the two system members exists

2. TREATY/INVITATION EXCLUSION
   - Militarized actions excluded when provided for by treaty with, or occur at invitation of, targeted state
   - No militarized incident exists until treaty/invitation is revoked and militarized incident occurs
   - Or when militarized actions clearly exceed treaty/agreement bounds
   - Note: Unlikely to apply in 2015-2024 temporal domain

3. EXPLICIT, NON-ROUTINE, GOVERNMENTALLY AUTHORIZED ACTION
   - Actions must be explicit, non-routine, and governmentally authorized
   - Vague or non-specific actions do not qualify
   - Alleged or dubious actions: MIE exists only when targeted state responds militarily/diplomatically OR action verified by impartial observer
   - When in doubt, code it and note concerns

4. OFFICIAL FORCES REQUIREMENT
   - Militarized incident must be overt action by official military forces or government representatives (head of state, foreign minister, etc.)
   - Disguised regular forces, non-regular forces, covert operations excluded unless:
     * Further militarized incidents involving official forces occur, OR
     * Targeted state responds militarily/diplomatically to the act
   - In states with virtually non-existent official military forces: local forces qualify only when directed by central government representative for specific military action
   - When in doubt, code it and note concerns

5. WITHIN-WAR MIEs
   - (Omitted - we now code within-war MIEs)

6. ACTIONS AGAINST PRIVATE CITIZENS
   - Actions by official forces against private citizens of another state generally not coded as militarized incidents
   - Exceptions include:
     * Seizures within disputed territory confines
     * Attacks on international shipping
     * Pursuit of rebel forces across international boundaries
   - Such incidents included only when targeted state responded militarily or protested diplomatically

STEP TWO: WHAT ACTION TOOK PLACE?
=================================

Possible MIE actions to code:

1.  Threat to use force - Most common threat; must be specific threat to another country's forces
2.  Threat to blockade - Same as #1, but specifically a blockade; rare
3.  Threat to occupy territory - As with #1, but occupation is the threat
4.  Threat to declare war - Must be specific threat, made by government official, to declare war
5.  Threat to use CBR weapons - Very rare
6.  Threat to join war - Also rare
7.  Show of force - Very common MIE; ships/airplanes sent to conflict area to show intentions; could be army forces gathering on border
8.  Alert - Article contains "put forces on alert" or similar
9.  Nuclear alert - Same as #8 but for nuclear forces; very rare
10. Mobilization - Forces mobilized or similar; different from show of force and alert; forces actively preparing
11. Fortify border - Fortifications (personnel, tanks, material) added to border
12. Border violation - Personnel crossed international border (one soldier or many)
13. Blockade - Ships used to blockade territory; rare in this temporal range
14. Occupation of territory - Forces held another country's territory for more than 24 hours
15. Seizure - Personnel or material seized by government forces; must be responded to with another MIE or protest by targeted country
16. Attack - Fighting which one side's forces clearly started
17. Clash - Fighting but unclear who started it
19. Use of CBR weapons - Very rare
22. War Battle - Note these and set aside; organized fighting attempting to take land or force policy change

STEP THREE: CODING THE MIE
==========================

Variables to code for each identified MIE:

CORE IDENTIFICATION VARIABLES:
- micnum: Militarized Interstate Confrontation (MIC) number (4-digit, 7000s range, unique per conflict)
- eventnum: Individual event number within confrontation (1 = first threat/display/use of force)

COUNTRY CODES:
- ccode1: Correlates of War (CoW) country code for state issuing threat/display/use of force targeting ccode2
- ccode2: CoW country code for state targeted by threat/display/use of force
- Note: In clashes, lower number ccode is ccode1, higher is ccode2

TIMING VARIABLES:
- stmon: Start month (1-12, no missing values)
- stday: Start day (1-31, use -9 for missing days only if absolutely necessary)
- styear: Start year (2015-2024, no missing values)
- endmon: End month (1-12, no missing values)
- endday: End day (1-31, use -9 for missing days only if absolutely necessary)
- endyear: End year (2015-2024)

CONFRONTATION VARIABLES:
- sidea: Side A in confrontation (state that initiated first militarized action); dichotomous (1 = Side A, 0 = Side B)
- action: Type of action ccode1 targeted ccode2 with (1-22, see action list above)

FATALITY VARIABLES:
- fatalmin1: Minimum military battle-deaths for ccode1
- fatalmax1: Maximum military battle-deaths for ccode1
- fatalmin2: Minimum military battle-deaths for ccode2
- fatalmax2: Maximum military battle-deaths for ccode2
- Note: No missing values; no ranges including 0 and positive numbers (e.g., 0-25); determine if no fatalities (0,0) or some fatalities (e.g., 1,25)

ADDITIONAL VARIABLES:
- Location: Short text description of event location
- MeasuringPoint: More precise location description if available
- Purpose: MIE purpose codes:
  * (0) traditional MIE
  * (1) accident
  * (2) surveillance
  * (3) rebel
  * (4) process event
- ForceType: Majority force type (1 = army/land-based, 2 = naval, 3 = air force)
- MinForce: Minimum number of forces in ForceType
- MaxForce: Maximum number of forces in ForceType

CODING GUIDELINES:
==================

1. When in doubt about MIE existence, code it and note concerns
2. Treaty/invitation exclusions unlikely in 2015-2024 period
3. Focus on explicit, non-routine, governmentally authorized actions
4. Official forces requirement is key - must be overt actions by official military or government representatives
5. Private citizen actions generally excluded unless specific exceptions apply
6. Fatalities coding: avoid missing values and ranges including zero
7. Location and purpose coding provide important context
8. Force type and size estimates help characterize the event

QUALITY CONTROL:
================

- Double-check country codes for accuracy
- Verify timing information is complete
- Ensure action codes match the described events
- Review fatality estimates for consistency
- Confirm all required variables are coded
- Note any uncertainties or special circumstances

This coding system will create a comprehensive database of Militarized Interstate Events for the 2015-2024 period, enabling analysis of international conflict patterns and escalation dynamics.
