Assault in Mali Reverses Gains on Extremism:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. BAMAKO, Mali -- The terrorists chose carefully: There are nearly always French, Russian and even a few American visitors to be found in the hotel restaurant, around the pool, in the health club or on the thin black-leather sofas of the glass-fronted lobby, now shattered by gunfire.With its marble floors, open atrium and lipstick-red lounge, the Radisson Blu Hotel served as a lifeline to the world, a gathering place where diplomats, contractors and others doing business in Mali, one of the poorest countries on earth, could all be found.Now, bullet holes pockmark the walls and blood is pooled on stairs. The hotel, once a symbol of the international presence in a country trying to emerge from years of upheaval, is the site of a massacre in which terrorists killed 19 people, storming in at breakfast on Friday as terrified diners sprinted into an elevator whose doors did not close in time to save them.""For those people who did this, they have no sense of the value of life,"" President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta said at the foot of the ransacked hotel on Saturday afternoon.The brutal attacks in Paris this month were a strike against France's joie de vivre. The siege of Kenya's gleaming Westgate mall two years ago was an assault on that country's rising prosperity, modernity and stability. The terrifying attack on the Radisson Blu here in Mali's capital was a strike on this nation's fragile efforts to restore peace after years of fighting.But in all of these places, the same fundamental question applies: How does a democratic society protect itself from a few determined extremists who can upend an entire nation with a single devastating strike?""Nobody has found the way to really kick-start a multidimensional approach to countering radicalism,"" said Jean-Herve Jezequel, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.Even in Iraq and Afghanistan, where thousands of lives and billions of dollars have been spent trying to wrest those countries from chaos, extremist forces are flourishing.It is a lesson that Mali knows only too well.Before the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, swept across wide stretches of Syria and Iraq, establishing a self-proclaimed caliphate, black flags flew in Mali.After a rebellion and military coup plunged the country into disarray, jihadists from across the Sahel charged through northern Mali. They abducted girls and raped them, imposed their harsh version of Islam on the towns they took over, carried out summary executions and destroyed ancient Sufi shrines. They drove out tens of thousands of Malians from their homes, and ruled the northern half of the country for months in 2012 while the rest of the country could do little more than watch.Unlike in Syria, the West did not sit on the sidelines while the country disintegrated. France, the former colonial power, put hundreds of boots on the ground, chasing out the extremists from the towns they controlled, scattering them to the desert and killing some of their top leaders, while the United Nations took on the job of working out a peace deal between the government and the rebels.There are close to 10,000 peacekeepers still in Mali, along with drones that hover over the region. And yet, even after elections and a peace deal to set the country on a new course, extremists have carried out multiple terrorist attacks this year against civilian targets like a restaurant and another hotel, shaking the nation's faith.""It means that we're not over it yet,"" said Karim Keïta, the president's son and the head of Mali's commission of national defense. ""We had a terrorist past, but we're not over it.""Witnesses described how easy it was for the gunmen to carry out the attack on the Radisson Blu on Friday, for which militants linked with Al Qaeda claimed responsibility.Across the street from the hotel, Ibrahim Maiga was in his apartment over his small corner store when he noticed something odd outside his window: a man fishing a few things out of a suitcase that he had opened on the ground.The man pulled out a grenade, a gun and some other items that Mr. Maiga could not make out. The man then picked up the gun and fired it into the air before walking toward two security guards outside the hotel. He shot one, crossed the road, then shot the other. Both of the men collapsed, Mr. Maiga said. One of them, a friend of Mr. Maiga's, later died.Hotel guests were at breakfast around 7 a.m. on the mezzanine level of the hotel when the shots first rang out.""We heard shooting, pa-pa-pa, from Kalashnikov,"" said Ali Yazbeck, 30, the assistant patisserie chef on duty. The head chef shouted that there was an attack, he said. Guests and staff members fled together from the dining room through the kitchen, to a staff elevator at the back of the building.""The lift takes eight, but there were many more than that,"" Mr. Yazbeck recounted from his hospital bed. ""The doors would not close.""A gunman appeared and opened fire. Mr. Yazbeck, a slim man with glasses, was the first to fall, shot in the neck. He prayed silently as the gunman turned to the open elevator and gunned down everyone inside. They were hotel guests, Mr. Yazbeck said: French, Chinese, among others.Within minutes, the killer returned. For a second time, Mr. Yazbeck feigned death. ""I felt shots brushing by my head,"" he said. The gunman leaned close and lightly brushed Mr. Yazbeck's lips with his hand, apparently checking to see if he were still alive. Then he left.Mr. Yazbeck said he stayed frozen in fear in his hiding place for hours, listening to gunfire and explosions reverberate through the hotel, until security forces eventually rescued him and others around 3 p.m.The gunmen -- Mr. Yazbeck said he saw two in all -- were young, 20 or 21, he estimated, and appeared calm. They wore baseball caps. The first was dark-skinned and had a black turban around his neck, he said. The second was lighter skinned. They made no comment or explanation for what they were doing.The first gunman was laughing when he opened fire on the foreign guests, Mr. Yazbeck said. At one point, the second gunman came into the kitchen and calmly took some meat from the fridge, grilled it and ate it during a break in the killing.They targeted foreigners and Malians equally, Mr. Yazbeck said, and did not hesitate to open fire on fellow Muslims (a statement that was at odds with other accounts). ""When he saw me, he just fired,"" he said. Three of the five hotel staff members on breakfast duty were killed, he said.During coups and countercoups, violent demonstrations and rebel incursions in the north, the Radisson Blu continued to operate, even when the guest count dwindled to a few rooms.The tally of those who died hereon Friday is a testament to the global hub the hotel had become: Among them were one American, two Belgians, six Russians and three Chinese. They included a development specialist, railroad construction executives, air cargo employees bringing in machinery, and a foreign government worker in the country for a conference on training Mali's civil servants.Still, even with hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and continued international engagement -- Mr. Keïta, Mali's president, was recently received with great pomp in Paris by the French president, with Malian flags adorning the Champs-Élysées -- Mali is as troubled as ever, according to analysts.A political solution for the fractured nation remains elusive, with jihadists rejecting it outright. ""Large swaths of territory"" remain ""devoid of state authority,"" leaving armed groups free to commit ""abuses with impunity,"" Human Rights Watch warned this year.""There are a lot of actors who continue to threaten,"" said Pierre Englebert, an expert on African politics at Pomona College. ""We are not far from where we were in 2012 in terms of state weakness.""For some, the attacks show the limitations of a military-driven approach to fighting terrorism, and how hard it is to find a solution that actually works.""It's been 3 years that French are eliminating some extremist leaders, with some success by the way,"" said Mr. Jezequel of the crisis group. ""But it does not solve the problem.""",0.0
The Mets Trade for a Star Outfielder After All:   [Sports Desk ],,"David Wright was conducting a group interview near his locker on Friday afternoon and the clock over his right shoulder read 3:53, seven minutes from the trade deadline. It was then that a reporter informed him that news was circulating that the Mets had acquired Yoenis Cespedes, the Cuban-born outfielder with the powerful bat and arm and the ability to electrify a crowd.A big smile spread across Wright's face.""We've been through this before,"" he said, still grinning, a knowing reference to the Mets' trade for Milwaukee center fielder Carlos Gomez that had fallen through just two days before.This time, though, there was no retreat. General Manager Sandy Alderson walked into a Citi Field news conference room a short while later to announce that the deal was official, making clear that the Mets, a team that has not been in the postseason since 2006 and has not even had a winning season since moving into its current stadium in 2009, is serious about contending right now.""We believe we're in position to compete through the rest of the season for a playoff spot,"" Alderson said, ""and we're going to do everything we can to ensure that competitive level.""The Mets made that point in a particularly emphatic way because the 29-year-old Cespedes is one of the game's more exciting players.Everything he does is energetic, from his violent swings to his bat flips, from his big throws to his bigger home runs. He has twice won the All-Star Game home run derby, including the one held in 2013 at Citi Field. He spent that night launching souvenirs around the upper deck in what could be an impressive foreshadowing of his first game in Queens, which should come on Saturday night.Cespedes defected to the United States from Cuba by speedboat in 2011, after a 23-hour voyage to the Dominican Republic. He did a workout there that was recorded and showed him hitting home runs, sprinting shirtless and lifting weights. The Oakland Athletics signed him for $36 million, in time for the 2012 season.He played well for the A's and went to the postseason with them twice, but last year he was dealt to Boston in the deal that sent Jon Lester to Oakland. In the off-season he was then traded to the Tigers in exchange for starting pitcher Rick Porcello.This season, he is batting .293, with 18 home runs and 61 runs batted in. He immediately becomes the Mets' best weapon on defense and arguably their best hitter, and his right-handed power in the middle of the order will be a useful counterbalance to the Mets' two other power hitters, Lucas Duda and Curtis Granderson, both of whom are left-handed.More than anything, he should add some oomph to the Mets' lineup. The Mets went into Friday's game having scored the fewest runs of any team in baseball.""This is the kind of player that can have a big impact both in terms of the game on the field and how the team is perceived,"" Alderson said.The Mets had originally pegged Gomez to bolster the Mets' lineup and would have sent Wilmer Flores and Zack Wheeler to the Brewers to acquire him. But that trade fell through, with differing theories as to why. Which left the Mets' front office to turn to other options as Friday's 4 p.m. trade deadline drew closer.Alderson and his deputies made calls and juggled proposals. Cincinnati outfielder Jay Bruce seemed to be an option, and then he was not. Finally, an agreement emerged with the Tigers.""I salute the front office,"" Manager Terry Collins said. ""I salute the ownership.""Over the past week, the Mets acquired four players -- Kelly Johnson, Juan Uribe, Tyler Clippard and Cespedes -- who added to their infield depth, fortified their bullpen and strengthened their offense. They did so without adding any significant money to a payroll that has become famously modest for a big-market team or trading away any of their young players in the major leagues.What the Mets did do to make their deals was dip into their impressive pitching depth in the minor leagues and trade away some players who may or may not turn out to be pretty good at some point in the future. Specifically, in the case of Cespedes, the Mets gave up two minor league right-handers, Luis Cessa and Michael Fulmer, who was a first-round draft pick in 2011 and has pitched impressively at Class AA this season.The price was not higher for Cespedes because he is essentially a two-month rental. He is making $10.5 million this year -- the Mets will not have to pay much of it -- and will become a free agent at season's end, when there is a good chance he will be in position to command a new multiyear deal worth tens of millions of dollars, the kind of money the Mets rarely spend these days.Cespedes also has an unusual clause in his contract that adds still more pressure on the Mets if they do try to sign him to a new deal.The clause stipulates that if his current team does not re-sign Cespedes within an exclusive five-day window at the end of the World Series, it cannot try again until the following May, which, for sure, would be too late. So, in effect, the Mets will have very little time to persuade Cespedes to stick around for a whole lot of money.Still, on Friday, Alderson saw no reason to rule out Cespedes's return in 2016.""If he plays well for us and enjoys New York, that's always a possibility,"" Alderson said.The Mets plan to play Cespedes in left field, his normal position, which could create a problem if, and when, Michael Cuddyer returns from the disabled list.At that point, Curtis Granderson could shift to center field and take time away from Juan Lagares.But for now, the Mets were simply happy to dwell on the present.Travis d'Arnaud returned to the lineup on Friday after about six weeks on the disabled list. Wright, who has not played in a game since April, went through another workout with positive results. And Cespedes was set to join the team this weekend.""Give him credit,"" Wright said of Alderson. ""He said he wanted to be aggressive. He said we're trying to win now. When you make moves, it backs that up.""Photograph Photo (Photograph by Chris O'meara/Associated Press) (D1); Yoenis Cespedes, Acquired by the Mets On Friday in a Trade with the Tigers, Is Batting .293 with 18 Home Runs and 61 R.B.I.

FIFA Issues Unexpected Ban of Its Former Vice President:   [Sports Desk ],,"In a largely symbolic move, FIFA, the international organization overseeing world soccer, announced Tuesday that it had barred Jack Warner, a former vice president who left the sport's leadership amid scandal four years ago.Mr. Warner, of Trinidad and Tobago, is among 14 men who were indicted by the United States in May on widespread corruption charges, including bribery and kickback schemes dating to 1991. The allegations against Mr. Warner have mounted this month; Swiss investigators announced last week that they were scrutinizing an element of Mr. Warner's record for which the United States had not charged him -- his purchase of valuable World Cup television rights from Sepp Blatter, FIFA's president, in 2005 for an amount potentially 33 times lower than market value. The deal ignited suspicions of a quid pro quo agreement.Still, the timing of FIFA's announcement Tuesday -- four months after Mr. Warner was charged and many of his peers were barred from soccer -- was unexpected. Years before, Mr. Warner had been under investigation by FIFA after he was suspected of offering bribes in exchange for election votes. In response, he resigned in 2011 from both FIFA and Concacaf, a regional confederation overseeing soccer in North and Central America and the Caribbean.In a statement, FIFA said its independent ethics committee had been examining the bidding contests for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups since January, months before the United States' case was announced. Those bidding contests, won by Russia and Qatar, are at the center of the Swiss inquiry.The FIFA ethics committee decided to bar Mr. Warner on Friday, the statement said, the same day that Swiss authorities announced their latest investigation into the World Cup contract potentially implicating Mr. Blatter.""Mr. Warner was found to have committed many and various acts of misconduct continuously and repeatedly during his time as an official in different high-ranking and influential positions,"" FIFA's statement said. ""He was a key player in schemes involving the offer, acceptance and receipt of undisclosed and illegal payments, as well as other moneymaking schemes.""Without further detail on the misconduct, FIFA -- which has undertaken its own internal inquiry, led by the law firm Quinn Emanuel, and is sharing information with authorities in the United States -- said Mr. Warner was found to have violated six articles of its code of ethics. He is forbidden to take part in any kind of organized soccer at the national and international level.Mr. Warner, 72, was characteristically defiant in response. He issued his own statement on his Facebook page in the wake of FIFA's announcement Tuesday.""I left the FIFA in April 2011 and if in September 2015 (some four years and five months after) the FIFA wants to ban me for life without even a hearing then so be it,"" it said. ""I do not believe, however, that this will serve as the distraction to the FIFA's present problems as the FIFA wishes it to be.""Indeed, the United States' case marches on: Six of Mr. Warner's fellow former FIFA officials sit in jail in Switzerland, and on Tuesday, Swiss authorities approved the third extradition this month, of Eduardo Li, the former president of the Costa Rican soccer federation. Mr. Li has 30 days to appeal that decision, which could take until spring 2016 to resolve in Swiss courts.In recent weeks, authorities have approved the extradition of Eugenio Figueredo, former head of Conmebol, the South American soccer confederation, and Rafael Esquivel, former head of the Venezuelan soccer federation. Both informed the Swiss Federal Office of Justice last week that they plan to appeal those decisions, the office confirmed Tuesday.Mr. Blatter is holding on to the FIFA presidency in the face of the Swiss investigation of him. On Monday, he addressed staff members in Zurich. According to his lawyer, Richard Cullen of McGuireWoods, Mr. Blatter ""informed the staff that he was cooperating with the authorities, reiterated that he had done nothing illegal or improper and stated that he would remain as president of FIFA.""",0.0
Vox and BuzzFeed Obtain Interviews With Obama:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"A pair of fast-growing digital media companies, Vox and BuzzFeed, have landed their first interviews with President Obama.Ezra Klein and Matt Yglesias of Vox sat down with the president in January. Their interview will be published online Monday morning. Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed, will speak with the president at the White House on Tuesday.The interviews are the latest indication that Vox and BuzzFeed News have emerged as serious news organizations, and are a further sign of the Obama administration's efforts to connect with millennials and broaden its reach beyond traditional media outlets.""We've always covered the White House quite aggressively, and I think that they want to speak to our audience,"" Mr. Smith said. ""This is sort of a demonstration of how, when you do serious news and you have a mass audience, those things can really support each other rather than getting in each other's way.""Mr. Obama will also participate in a video shoot with BuzzFeed's new video production unit.Vox and BuzzFeed News are both leveraging Facebook to publicize the conversations. On Sunday afternoon, Vox posted a short preview of its interview on the social networking site. BuzzFeed News has invited users to submit questions for the president before the interview, and plans to post video of Mr. Obama exclusively on Facebook.The interviews are the most recent attempt by President Obama to use new media platforms, including YouTube, Twitter and Vine, to get out his message on a number of policy issues. Mr. Obama has also appeared on the mock celebrity interview show ""Between Two Ferns,"" on the comedy website Funny or Die, and sat for interviews on ""The Daily Show"" and ""The Colbert Report.""Dan Pfeiffer, the departing senior adviser to the president, plans to offer recommendations for integrating the White House's digital media strategy with its communications operation.For both BuzzFeed News and Vox, the interviews represent a significant step forward for new digital media organizations, which continue to encroach on territory once reserved for print and broadcast news outlets.""Interviewing the president is a great journalistic opportunity, and that's how we approached it,"" Mr. Klein said in a statement. ""What we wanted to do here, above all, was to create something that would have a lot of enduring value to our readers.""In the brief video clip posted on Vox's Facebook page, Mr. Obama's remarks are interspersed with infographics. By Sunday evening, the video had already been viewed more than 320,000 times.",0.0
Kentucky: Sheriff Defends Officer Shown Handcuffing Child in Video:   [Brief ],,"The county sheriff in Covington on Tuesday defended a school resource officer who was shown on a video restraining an 8-year-old boy with handcuffs last year, saying the officer had acted appropriately while responding to a request from school officials to ""de-escalate and defuse a threat to others."" The handcuffing is the subject of a federal lawsuit filed Monday by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Kenton County sheriff's office, Sheriff Charles L. Korzenborn and the resource officer, Deputy Kevin Sumner; a video shows the boy, who has attention hyperactivity deficit disorder and had been acting out in school, crying as Deputy Sumner holds his arms behind his back and places handcuffs on his biceps. In a statement, Sheriff Korzenborn said the deputy ""did what he is sworn to do and in conformity with all constitutional and law enforcement standards.""",0.0
"A Year Later, Cable Giants' Merger Is Still Up in the Air:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"A year after it was announced, Comcast's audacious acquisition of Time Warner Cable remains in limbo as Washington regulators scrutinize the deal. No surprise there. After all, the $45 billion merger would consolidate an already-concentrated industry, uniting the two largest cable operators in the United States.But in recent weeks, the air of inevitability around the deal has dissipated. With the Federal Communications Commission proposing stringent new rules to govern the Internet, analysts have grown more skeptical about the acquisition being approved. Investors began betting against the combination late last month, with shares of both companies falling sharply before recovering last week.""The prospects for the deal, while they're still not bad, have continued to go down,"" said Kevin Werbach, a former F.C.C. counsel and a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.Advisers to both companies acknowledge that passing regulatory muster is far from certain. Yet David L. Cohen, an executive vice president at Comcast, expressed confidence that the merger would still be approved but acknowledged that the outcome was hard to handicap.""This is a bit of a black-box process,"" he said. ""You don't really know what's going on under the surface.""In Washington, officials at the Justice Department and F.C.C. are poring over data to decide whether to approve the deal, and what if any concessions the companies must make to satisfy antitrust laws. The review continues even as Comcast and Time Warner Cable are completing the minutiae of their planned merger.Among the issues being examined by regulators are whether a combined Comcast and Time Warner Cable would have too much sway over how traffic moves around the Internet and how much consumers and companies pay for Internet access.If regulators allow the deal, the company would control an estimated 35 percent of broadband Internet service coverage and just under 30 percent of the country's pay television subscribers.Fueling the uncertainty is a series of remarks made by Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F.C.C., before a vote by the commission on Feb. 26. Mr. Wheeler has proposed regulating the Internet like a utility, under Title II of the Communications Act.If approved, such a move would give the F.C.C. the authority to ensure that content is not blocked on the Internet, and that broadband providers cannot charge companies for the privilege of allowing their websites to load faster -- the essential components of what is known as net neutrality.Though Mr. Wheeler's proposal is not directly related to the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger, those familiar with the F.C.C. say it signals a more vigorous approach to protecting customers, which could also affect thinking on the deal.""What the F.C.C. is now apparently going to adopt signals a much harder line on their view of the state of competition in the broadband market,"" Mr. Werbach said. ""If their view is that the market is not working as it is right now, it's less likely that they're going to feel that a combination of two of the largest players is going to be in the public interest.""If Comcast's acquisition of Time Warner Cable were to be blocked by either agency, the industry could be thrown into tumult, with industry observers speculating that it would set off a flurry of new deal activity.""I don't think they would say so publicly, but I think everyone involved has to be at least considering a Plan B,"" said Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson research. He recently lowered his odds that the deal goes through from 80-20 to 70-30, for factors including a changing regulatory environment and potential changes to how regulators define the broadband market.Yet with all the uncertainty, it is impossible to know how the F.C.C. and Justice Department will rule. Regulators rarely telegraph their intentions, though in some past deals that have been blocked, regulators have sent subtle signals about how reviews were going; they have yet to do that during this review process.Comcast is in touch with regulators almost every day, Mr. Cohen said, supplying them with information about business operations and plans for the integration of Time Warner Cable.""There is nothing that we have heard as part of those contacts that suggest this transaction's review is any different than our prior transaction reviews, when our deals have been approved,"" he said.Time Warner Cable executives also expressed confidence in the deal, saying on a recent conference call that they expect the closing of the merger with Comcast to occur ""early this year.""Comcast deploys a vigorous lobbying effort in Washington, spending $17 million on such efforts last year, which made the cable operator one of the biggest corporate campaigners in the country. In several instances, state and local officials, including Hawaii's governor and Oregon's secretary of state, have sent letters to the F.C.C. supporting the deal that were written almost entirely by Comcast employees. (Government officials first had asked Comcast for help in providing the information.)As for the government's own timetable, the Justice Department has no firm deadline. The F.C.C. has an informal agenda to rule by the end of March, but could extend that.Consideration of the deal by the F.C.C.is expected to intensify next month, after the net neutrality vote. At the same time, both the F.C.C. and the Justice Department are weighing the antitrust ramifications of another proposed media merger, the acquisition of DirecTV by AT&T.Even if regulators approved the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger, they could demand onerous concessions from Comcast. If that were to occur, or if Comcast decided that new net neutrality rules would hurt the merged company, it could simply change its mind and refuse to complete the deal, which forgoes a breakup fee.Mr. Cohen emphasized this point in an interview. ""It is absolutely accurate that we have a very broad right to walk away from the transaction,"" he said, without elaborating on what conditions could cause Comcast to walk away.Yet he cautioned that there was no indication that regulators would ask for costly divestitures.""There hasn't been anything that we have heard at this point that has led us to believe that anybody is thinking about imposing overly burdensome conditions on this transaction,"" Mr. Cohen said.But if regulators did ask for some divestitures, Comcast is unlikely to simply abandon the deal. In Time Warner Cable, Comcast sees the opportunity to become a truly national provider of television, Internet and phone services, giving it unparalleled scale.Amy Yong, an analyst with Macquarie research, said the importance of Time Warner Cable's assets had only increased for Comcast in the last year, as competition from telecom providers like AT&T and new entrants like Google has grown fiercer.Because there is no formal proposal, Mr. Cohen would not say whether the new net neutrality rules might make the deal less financially attractive to Comcast. Even if the proposal is approved, it will face months, and possibly years, of review and potential legal appeals. Before that process is complete, a new administration could change the rules yet again.Comcast, meanwhile, is spending countless hours and millions of dollars planning to swallow Time Warner Cable, and brushing aside any suggestion that the regulatory winds are blowing the wrong way.""There's no demonstrable information out there that that is the case,"" Mr. Cohen said. ""The regulators haven't talked, because they never talk.""Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.",0.0
Europe; Russia: Man Is Accused of Killing and Dismembering His Six Children:   [Brief ],,"The Russian police have arrested a man suspected of killing and dismembering his six young children, his wife and his mother. The suspect, Oleg Belov, was wounded by police gunfire while resisting arrest and was in stable condition Wednesday after surgery, local health officials said.

"Hitting the Gym and the Trails, Looking to Extend the Golden Years:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"VINCE AND LINDA FERRIGNO no longer eat 30 fried shrimp every Friday night. In fact, they rarely eat anything fried. Instead of drenching their salads in dressing, they dip in a fork and spear the vegetables. They mostly steer clear of bread and pasta, and limit their daily caloric intake to 1,500. They write down their fitness objectives, and they exercise together three days a week.""It's good for our marriage, good for our health,"" said Ms. Ferrigno, 67, a retired wedding consultant who lives with her husband in Jacksonville, Fla.This routine was not always so. It wasn't until Mr. Ferrigno, now 78 and the retired owner of a company that made air-conditioners, was in his early 70s that he started caring about his physical well-being. But even then he did not do much about it.Working out was never his thing. ""I played a little ball, but that was it. I'm not like Louie Ferrigno,"" he said, referring to Lou Ferrigno, the actor and former body builder who played the title character in the television show ""The Incredible Hulk."" (He's a distant cousin, Vince Ferrigno says.)After selling his company two years ago, Mr. Ferrigno decided it was time, finally, to shed the 70 pounds that had plagued him since he began logging 10 to 12 hours a day in the office. If he didn't lose weight, he wouldn't be able to enjoy his retirement. He might not even live many more years. ""I started realizing I had to change my ways or 90 or 100 isn't going to be reached,"" said Mr. Ferrigno, who has high blood pressure.To help him stay on track, he and his wife, who has lost 30 pounds, spend a week each year at Hilton Head Health, a weight loss resort in South Carolina, which costs $3,290 per person, per week ($2,800 per person if two or more come together). There they exercise three to four hours a day, eat healthy food and enjoy lectures on nutrition and general well-being. Mr. Ferrigno has gone from 250 pounds to 210, and hopes to reach 195.Common wisdom has held that if you have not adopted an exercise or fitness routine in your early years, you probably won't start in later life. But like so many misconceptions about middle and post-middle age, the idea is slowly fading way. According to the International Health Racquet & Sportsclub Association, people 55 and older are the fastest-growing membership segment for the health club industry. In 1990, 1.9 million health club members were age 55 and above; last year, that figure hit 12 million, a 532 percent increase.Many clubs are catering to this age group, hiring trainers with specialized certifications and offering specific low-impact classes, said Meredith Poppler, a spokeswoman for the association. An April 2015 report from Marketdata Enterprises, which tracks the diet and fitness industry, estimates that 17.2 million adults 55 and older are dieting.The driving force is usually health. ""They had a heart attack, or a friend had a heart attack,"" said Dr. John Whyte, an internist in Great Falls, Va., and author of the ""AARP New American Diet: Lose Weight, Live Longer."" ""They've been told they have pre-diabetes. They finally get a 'jolt' that makes them decide they need to start working out.""Medicare will cover obesity screening and behavioral counseling, though there are some stipulations.So many people, especially those with discretionary income, are starting their programs at fitness and health resorts, where they can exercise in a controlled environment, eat healthful food and learn about proper nutrition. Retirees often have the time and resources to drop out of the real world for a few weeks and focus on their health.Sheree Janke, 57, of Edmonton, Alberta, is a semiretired dental hygienist who works one day a week. Seven years ago she wanted to lose the 41 pounds she had gained after having three children in nearly four years. Her blood pressure was rising, and her doctor wanted to put her on medication. She balked. ""Once you start going on those meds you don't get off of them unless you make a major lifestyle change,"" she said.She did a web search for ""boot camp"" and found Fitness Ridge (now called Movara Fitness Resort), in Ivins, Utah. For about $1,500 a week, she could hike six to eight miles a day, eat three healthful meals, take exercise classes and get herself back on track. She lost the weight, which she has more or less kept off, and returns to Movara annually for a tuneup.""It was the motivation I needed to keep getting healthier in order to have a better quality of life in retirement,"" Ms. Janke said.For Ms. Janke, Movara's price tag only added to her drive. ""I realized there is not much good in having all this money invested in retirement products if I didn't have a healthy body to live in,"" she said. ""Sometimes retirement focus becomes so much on the money accumulated rather than the quality of life you are going to have in retirement.""Exercise certainly helps people look and feel younger. A recent study of participants in the Senior Olympics, a biennial competition for amateur athletes over 50, found that older athletes' fitness age was about 20-plus years younger than their chronological age. What's more, a majority of the 10,000 men and women competing in this year's games, held in Minneapolis-St. Paul in early July, didn't begin serious training until middle age or later. Of course, not everyone plans to pole-vault in later life. For others, exercise and diet are also about mental health, and changing their approach to aging.For the last four years, Joe Boland, 61, who sells software in Ann Arbor, Mich., has worked with Steve Dailey, a business coach in Pahoa, Hawaii, to help him with his professional goals. Now he's focusing on his physical health. Next month, he is going to visit Mr. Dailey, who runs Base Camp Hawaii and Body Temple Boot Camp with his wife, Kieba Blacklidge Dailey.""I have not yet achieved my optimal weight goal. It's been a challenge for some years,"" said Mr. Boland, a former athlete who has had five knee surgeries. Although he swims two to three times a week and tries to eat well, he carries around 60 extra pounds. ""One of the motivations is that I want to live to be 90, and I want to keep walking and be healthy. My orthopedic surgeon says guys my size usually are not able to walk independently in their 70s, so I need to lose some weight.""But weight loss is just part of the plan. ""What he will focus on goes far beyond exercise and nutrition,"" said Mr. Dailey, 61, a former competitive swimmer. ""Exercise and nutrition are tools for a successful life. They aren't the end goal. My focus for Joe during his time here will be about developing a mind-set and the tools for living an extraordinary and purposed life in his second half.""John Striker, 71, a retired publisher who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, has hiked through Pakistan and India. He didn't want to lose his ""joy"" in later life. ""It's too easy to drift off into getting old,"" he said. ""The muscles are just not responding. You get up in the morning and you're stiffer. You've got to draw a line in the sand and say, 'I'm not going let that happen.' You have to up the effort to stay in shape.""For the last nine years, he has paid a visit to Mountain Trek in British Columbia every other year to be rejuvenated, paying $4,500 for seven nights. He hikes from five to 12 miles a day enjoying beautiful scenery, and eats no sugar or processed foods. He believes it is money well spent.""As I get older, I need to be reminded of the potential of my body, what it's capable of doing if I really take care of it,"" he said. ""My body may not be what it was at 25, but it can still respond.""Make the most of your money.

"Temporary Tattoos, Now for Grown-Ups, Too:   [Style Desk ]",,"At a Friday night cocktail party early this year at the auction house Christie's, some 400 prospective buyers in their 30s and 40s were checking out the old masterworks up for auction, including Caravaggio, a pair of Canalettos and a sketch by Rubens. But the art that drew the most fuss from the collectors was free: temporary tattoos that echoed the paintings for sale, including demons by a follower of Hieronymus Bosch and the monogram-like signature of Albrecht Dürer.The tattoos -- which the Phillip Lim- and Thom Browne-clad attendees applied two, three and four at a time (and Instagrammed in equal number) -- were so popular that party organizers eventually had to ask representatives from Tattly, the company that created them, to stop handing them out. It was after closing time, the bar had stopped serving, and the guests, still debating between Delft-like seashells and flowers from Balthasar van der Ast, showed no signs of leaving.""That's not typical for an old master painting party,"" Emma Kronman of Christie's said dryly. She added, ""I can't tell you how many people wrote to us afterward saying, 'Do you have any extra tattoos?' ""So much for Kim Kardashian's edict about tattoos: ""Don't put a bumper sticker on a Bentley."" In recent years, the no-commitment-required ink has gone from staple of children's birthday parties to of-the-moment accessory for all ages, applied at events organized by Vogue and Christian Louboutin and worn by celebrities like Beyoncé and Sarah Jessica Parker. (The model Cara Delevingne sported custom Chinese birds and blossoms on her arms, neck and chest at this year's Met Gala.)There are now more than a dozen companies offering ways to sleeve up for a day or three. But perhaps no company has done more to elevate temporary tattoos to wearable art than Tattly, a four-year-old Brooklyn-based company that works with artists like Milton Glaser, creator of the iconic ""I love NY"" logo; Stefan Sagmeister, who has designed album covers for David Byrne and the Rolling Stones; and the fashion photographer Garance Doré. Tattly tattoos are available at 1,000 stores in 30 countries, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Conran Shop in London, and Colette in Paris.""I've never seen such tasteful temporary tattoos,"" said John Maeda, the design partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and a former president of the Rhode Island School of Design. ""Temporary tattoos were down-market, and Tattly found a way to make them fashionable through high-quality content."" (Mr. Maeda has worn a Tattly tattoo just one time -- ""I felt cool for once,"" he said -- but regularly suggests them for gifts.)Tattly started as a side project for Tina Roth Eisenberg, voice of the notable design blog Swissmiss (she grew up in Speicher, Switzerland), and the kind of person who has a permanent ""out of office"" reply on her email. Her other successful side projects include CreativeMornings, a design-focused speaker series now on six continents, and TeuxDeux, an app Fast Company called ""the web's most beautiful to-do list.""In the spring of 2011, Ms. Eisenberg's daughter, who was 6, came home from a birthday party with yet another sheet of ""butterflies and ugly smiley faces,"" Ms. Eisenberg said. ""Granted, I'm probably a little bit snobby, but they were an insult to my Swiss aesthetics.""Ms. Eisenberg, who has a rule that she can only complain about something for so long before doing something about it, applied the offending tattoos to her daughter's arm, then promptly searched online for ways to make her own and emailed illustrator friends soliciting ideas. A specialist in user interface design, she created a website for Tattly (the name is a homage to her roots: ""When you want to make something sound cute in Swiss German, you add -ly on the end,"" she said). The site went live that July with 16 whimsical designs printed in vegetable ink, including a candy-colored '80s style Casio watch that reads ""late"" (still one of the company's top sellers) and a pencil-like scribble.Thanks in part to Ms. Eisenberg's blog and more than 430,000 Twitter followers, Tattly had 140 orders by the end of the first day. On the second day, a woman from the Tate Modern hunted down Ms. Eisenberg's phone number and called to request a wholesale catalog. Roughly 30 percent of online sales are international.Things really took off when, six months later, the Brooklyn Brewery requested a custom tattoo to distribute at its events. (It was designed by Mr. Glaser.) Soon, NPR asked for its popular radio shows to be reimagined as vintage ink, like a ""This American Life"" mermaid, and two tangled cobras for the two hosts of ""On the Media."" (Take that, pledge-drive tote bag.)Recent clients include SoulCycle, which distributed gold and silver wheels at its Hamptons studios; Mashable, which commissioned six emoji for its SXSW house; and the luxury brand Maiyet, which scattered hieroglyph-like black feather tattoos (one of the company's symbols) on the tables at a V.I.P. dinner in Gstaad, Switzerland. Also this year, Wilhelmina Models ordered gold script W's and ""XOWilhelmina"" (the founder's signature) for Art Basel, Coachella and New York Fashion Week.""We wanted it to be cool because we're catering to the model crowd and the fashion crowd, and it was a hit,"" said Tatiana Acosta, director of marketing for Wilhelmina Models. In what appears to be a standard refrain with Tattly clients, she added, ""Models kept coming back to my office and asking for more tattoos.""Tattly now offers some 600 designs, including vintage pastel-colored cameras, fruits and vegetables (distributed at the White House Easter egg hunt this year), Christoph Niemann's stylized battery running low on energy, and a black ""No sleep till Brooklyn"" (Instagrammed by Gwyneth Paltrow.) Artists receive royalties from the sale of their tattoos; last year, the company paid out more than $250,000. Last year, the company brought on Yng-Ru Chen, formerly of Sotheby's, to head up its lucrative partnerships (Athleta, for example, recently ordered 450,000 tattoos) and court the company's wish list of artists.Paola Antonelli, senior curator of the department of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, described the tattoos as ""so easy to wear,"" and ticked off the ones she's tried: ""The spiral labyrinth, the carrot, the arrows. I've worn the golden watch."" Of Ms. Eisenberg, Ms. Antonelli said: ""She's Wonder Woman. Ideas are a dollar a pound. Making them happen is a real heroic thing.""This Ms. Eisenberg does by sticking to her exacting standards. After a three-hour tour of a packing center in New Jersey, she was ready to sign on, until she realized the company ""would slap an ugly UPS label"" on shipments, she said, and wouldn't let her change it. In what she described as her ""very unusual, refreshing, direct way,"" she told them, ""I will not ship with you because my packaging needs to be awesome.""So it's done by hand in-house, which until this spring was a 1,600-square-foot space in a rundown former factory in Dumbo. (""I usually don't get in the elevator without food in case I'm stuck in here for hours,"" an employee said in that elevator.) Recently, the company roughly doubled its space with a move to a 1860s carriage factory in Cobble Hill, alongside studios of three of its artists.Ms. Eisenberg's principles also involve buying quirky designs even if she doesn't think they'll sell (she cites one ""sad straggler"" of little people in cars that she won't take off the website, even though ""we have like 4,996 left"" of a run of 5,000). Artists say she is more likely to say of designs ""not right now,"" instead of ""no."" Her criticism is usually spot on.""I did a pizza slice, and they said: 'Make it more greasy. Put more pepperoni, more cheese, make it more drippy,' "" said the illustrator Julia Rothman, whose designs include the ""late"" watch tattoo. ""When I look back at the original, I think, for sure, it needed this.""Ms. Rothman, who has created 81 Tattly designs, said she has been pleasantly surprised by the company's success. ""I knew because it was Tina it would be successful,"" she said, ""but I thought maybe it would fade.""Photograph An Attendee at a Party at Christie's, Wearing a Painting-Inspired Temporary Tattoo by Tattly.

"Paid Notice: Deaths CARRINGTON, KATHLEEN:   [Paid Death Notice ]",,"CARRINGTON--Kathleen. Kathleen Connell Carrington, 88, passed away peacefully on November 7, 2015 in Greenville, South Carolina. Kay, as she was known by her friends and family, was a steadfast and loving wife and mother. Born January 11, 1927 in Jersey City, New Jersey to John Norman Connell and Helen Burke Connell, Kay was one of nine children. Beautiful and unassuming, with an easy sense of humor and disarming smile, Kay graduated from Notre Dame College in Baltimore soon after the Second World War. Shortly thereafter she married Jim Carrington, a three-sport All-American, at the U.S. Naval Academy. In what has been described as a fairytale wedding, the midshipmen in their dress-whites rained rice upon the stunningly beautiful newlyweds as they ran beneath a shining arc of crossed sabers. Kay taught school until the arrival of the first of her five children, whom she raised in or near seaports around the world, from Yokosuka, Japan to Annapolis, Maryland. Like most Navy wives, while her husband was away at sea, often for months at a time, she stoically ran the householdwithout ever a complaint. Kay and Jim taught their children a great deal, but perhaps their most precious legacy was setting an example of how wonderful a marriage can be. As irony would have it, in the precise moment of Kay's sudden passing, all her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren were gathered together in California for the marriage of her grandson Michael. The thought would have pleased her to no end. Kay is survived by her daughters, Wendy Carrington, Nancy (Steve) Crown, and Kathleen (Steven) Anderson; sons, James Carrington, Jr., and Timothy (Cathleen) Carrington; sisters, Shelly Cullen, Madeleine Reilly, Elizabeth De Souza; brother, James Connell; ten grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews. She was preceded in death by her parents; husband James H.H. Carrington; sisters, Elise Leahy, Mary Lou Towey, and Nancy Bockus; brother, Jack Connell; and daughter-in-law Antonella Murgia Carrington. A service celebrating Kay's life is being planned for the spring of 2016. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Rheumatology Research Foundation, 2200 Lake Boulevard NE, Atlanta, GA 30319 or www.rheumresearch.org. 1/3",0.0
F.D.A. Takes Issue With the Term 'Non-G.M.O.':   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"Lost in the news about the Food and Drug Administration's approval of genetically engineered salmon on Thursday was its long-awaited guidelines on labeling food with or without genetically altered plant ingredients.While the F.D.A.'s stance on labeling -- it is not mandating disclosure of genetically modified ingredients -- has not changed despite intense pressure from both sides of the issue, it has added a bit of confusion to the mix for consumers and for those companies that are voluntarily including more information on their packaging.For starters, the F.D.A. does not favor the most commonly used term, non-G.M.O., which hundreds of companies plaster on tens of thousands of products on grocery store shelves.Short for ""genetically modified organism,"" G.M.O. conveys an overly broad and inaccurate meaning when applied to food products, the agency said.""Most foods do not contain entire organisms,"" the F.D.A. noted.Rather, the agency would prefer labels that say something like ""Not bioengineered"" or ""This oil is made from soybeans that were not genetically engineered.""Whether any food companies will adopt this language, or begin using nongenetically engineered foods rather than non-G.M.O., is unknown at this point.But major food companies have applauded the agency's position to not require genetically engineered ingredients to be disclosed. The F.D.A. has determined that such products are not materially different from their nonengineered cousins.Many food corporations have lobbied heavily against mandatory labeling, fearing that customers will be scared off by foods known to contain genetically engineered ingredients.Claire Parker, spokeswoman for the Coalition for Safe and Affordable Food, a food industry group, said in a statement that the coalition applauded the F.D.A. ""for standing up for sound science by opposing mandatory G.M.O. labeling that would mislead consumers and drive up food costs.""Many major food companies have already moved to voluntarily label products that do not contain genetically engineered ingredients, either simply stating that on their packaging or using a small butterfly seal to show that the Non-GMO Project, a nonprofit that provides certification for food producers, has certified the absence of genetic engineering.""All of the biggest food companies in the country are looking at how to source non-G.M.O. ingredients right now,"" said Megan Westgate, executive director of the Non-GMO Project, adding that it seems that the government's decision about the G.M.O. salmon was out of step with what the public is asking for.Ms. Westgate said that about 34,000 products were now labeled with the Non-GMO Project's seal, representing about $13.5 billion in annual sales. That's up from January, when 24,500 products bore the seal. (The Food Marketing Institute estimates that total supermarket sales were $638 billion last year.)Efforts at the state level over the last few years to mandate labeling of foods that do contain genetically engineered ingredients have largely failed by narrow margins, after heavy lobbying and campaign spending by the food and biotech industries.A labeling law was passed in Vermont and should take effect in July unless food industry groups succeed in getting it blocked by an appellate court.As that deadline approaches, lobbyists for the food and biotech businesses are scrambling to get federal legislation in place that would pre-empt such state-level requirements. The House of Representatives passed a bill that would do just that, and Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat of Michigan, said she hoped to get legislation passed in the Senate by the end of the year.The Senate bill might require companies to reveal the presence of genetic engineering via a QR code, a pixelated square that can be scanned with a smartphone, on packaging.Joe Sparatta, a chef with two restaurants, Heritage and Southbound, in Richmond, Va., said he was especially concerned about the F.D.A.'s decision not to require labeling of the genetically engineered salmon because his customers were demanding more information about the food on his menus.""Guests ask about everything,"" Mr. Sparatta said. ""Is there dairy in this? Is this fish wild or farmed? What are your animals eating? We try to source as much as we can locally, which helps us know more about the products we use, but we can't get everything from around here.""He said that customers had only recently begun to ask about whether things were genetically modified, but he expected to get the question more frequently. ""With this now being debated in Congress, I think more people are hearing about it and starting to ask questions and want to know,"" Mr. Sparatta said.Consumers are increasingly looking for information about the presence of genetically modified ingredients in their foods, according to research by the Hartman Group. ""The G.M.O. issue is something that continues to be brought up in an unprompted way in our interviews with consumers,"" said Laurie Demeritt, chief executive of Hartman. ""And when we look at things like fat, sodium and sugar, G.M.O. is showing the strongest growth rate in terms of a characteristic that consumers are trying to avoid.""In research Hartman did for a report on perceptions about genetically modified foods, about 58 percent of consumers were looking for ""non-G.M.O."" food.""It's connected to this idea that a product is processed,"" Ms. Demeritt said. ""Consumers have a vision in their minds of people in lab coats taking syringes and injecting things into a product, a vision of food made in a lab -- and that's even worse in their minds than food coming off a factory line.""She added that consumers did not necessarily understand what genetic engineering is, or even which crops are genetically engineered. ""While it's difficult for some people in the food space to hear because they want to educate consumers and talk to them about it, in most cases, consumers don't really want to hear a long explanation about the science behind it,"" she said.But if anything, the F.D.A. further complicated the issue by distinguishing the term ""genetic engineering"" from ""genetic modification.""""F.D.A. considers the term 'genetic modification' to be a much broader term that encompasses other means of altering the genome of an organism including selective breeding, and lab-based in vitro methods,"" the agency said in its announcement.The F.D.A. said it had no plans to take action against labels using ""G.M.O."" -- so long as the food in question was not genetically engineered in any way and the label was not otherwise false or misleading.Nonetheless, given the agency's definition of genetic modification, non-G.M.O labeling on thousands of products now in stores would technically be false because they contain plants genetically modified over centuries through hybridization and other conventional breeding techniques.For instance, under the F.D.A.'s definition, a corn chip made from conventional corn is genetically modified, but not genetically engineered -- an argument that the biotech industry has been making for years.Thus, the F.D.A cautioned that terms like ""G.M.O. free"" and ""non-G.M.O."" could face challenges and recommended that ""manufacturers not use food labeling claims that indicate that a food is 'free' of ingredients derived through the use of biotechnology.""""They're conflating what is a very new and novel technology with traditional types of breeding, which is simply crossing different varieties of, say, corn,"" said Andrew Kimbrell, founder and executive director of the Center for Food Safety, which is lobbying for mandatory labeling. ""It's kind of like saying an abacus is very much like a computer.""",0.0

"Wanted or Not, a Superheroic Rebooting:   [Review ]",,"The opening scenes of ""Fantastic Four"" -- 20th Century Fox's reboot of its Marvel superhero franchise -- take place in 2007, which happens to be the year that the second movie in the prerebooted franchise (""Rise of the Silver Surfer"") was released. Ben Grimm and Reed Richards (played as children by Evan Hannemann and Owen Judge, later by Jamie Bell and Miles Teller) don't mention that fact, because if they did the cinematic universe would collapse on itself and all light would be extinguished from the cosmos. Also, the thoughtful people at Fox probably don't want to remind anyone of those earlier movies.Some of us have long memories, though, and can summon the bad cinema of the mid-aughts with furious clarity. Looking back on those days, I remember -- Jessica Alba. O.K., forget it. I'll just go ahead and reboot my 2005 review of the first ""Fantastic Four"" origin story, which I said was ""fantastic only in its commitment to mediocrity."" That's still true, though a decade later it's true in different ways. Are you offended that I'm recycling material? Sorry, but I'm as susceptible to the influence of movies as anyone else.This ""Fantastic Four,"" directed by Josh Trank from a script he wrote with Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, feels less like a tale of superhero beginnings than like a very long precredit opening sequence. As boys growing up on Long Island, Reed and Ben are brains-and-brawn science-fair buddies.Reed is working on a teleporting machine that attracts the attention of Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), who runs some kind of boarding school/research center in Manhattan. There, Reed meets the Storm kids, Sue the scientist (Kate Mara) and Johnny the hot-rodder (Michael B. Jordan), and also a brooding intellectual named Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell).Much later, after they have traveled to a parallel dimension where a planet full of energy (please just fill in whatever exposition you feel will get you to the next part of this sentence), Victor will face down his erstwhile classmates and say: ""There is no more Victor. There is only DOOM!"" There is nothing wrong with that kind of line -- he's a newly fledged ultravillain in a comic-book movie, after all -- but it needs to be earned, with gravity or wit. The best superhero entertainments have both.""Fantastic Four,"" despite the dogged efforts of its talented young cast, has nothing. The special effects are at about the level of the early ""Harry Potter"" movies -- lots of glowing green clouds and ice-blue bolts and force fields. The human drama is meager. Once again, the only real pathos belongs to Mr. Bell's Ben, who finds himself trapped in a stony new body and weaponized by a ruthless government. Mr. Teller stretches, not as an actor but as a digitally enhanced body. Mr. Jordan burns in the same way, and Ms. Mara disappears. Her character also has the power to make other things vanish. I would say she should have exercised it on this movie, but in a week or two that should take care of itself.""Fantastic Four"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

"In Ukraine, It's Putin's Game:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BRUSSELS -- His country's oil export revenues and currency have slumped. Its economy is shrinking, and some of his own allies in Moscow have questioned where he is leading them. Yet when President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia sat down Wednesday in the Belarussian capital of Minsk with the leaders of Ukraine, Germany and France to discuss the conflict in eastern Ukraine, he still held the decisive cards.For months now, Europe's often fractious leaders have spoken with one voice on Ukraine, ruling out a military solution and pleading with all parties to find a way to resolve the dispute diplomatically. But in Minsk, they confronted the reality that Mr. Putin retains the upper hand precisely because he is prepared to use military force to get what he wants in diplomacy.In a sign of Europe's commitment to diplomacy, both Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, the Continent's most powerful political figure, and President François Hollande of France, the leader of Western Europe's biggest country, traveled to Minsk on Wednesday in a last-ditch attempt to revive a moribund peace process begun in September with a truce deal, which was also negotiated in Minsk. They did so despite what Ms. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said was just ""a glimmer of hope.""However, in Minsk, Europe's faith in a ""political solution"" -- a mantra repeated over the past year at every meeting in Brussels of leaders and foreign ministers -- confronted the hard reality created by Mr. Putin, whose support for separatist rebels gutted the last Minsk agreement, empowered their quest for a clear military solution and amplified voices in Washington calling for military aid to Ukraine.""Putin has got everyone spun up over what he is up to in Minsk, but he is playing a long game,"" said Fiona Hill, the United States' top intelligence officer on Russia from 2006 to 2009. ""He plays on multiple fronts. We start talking about a military response, and he starts talking about diplomacy.""Ms. Hill, now director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution and co-author of ""Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin,"" predicted that any new cease-fire accord would ""only be temporary like the last one"" because Mr. Putin constantly shifts between diplomatic and military options, depending on which he sees as giving Russia the most advantage.The West, she added, assisted Russia's tactical maneuvering by making it clear what it wanted while Mr. Putin constantly keeps everyone guessing. ""You can win on a weak hand if your opponent is always showing you their hand,"" she said.Speaking in Brussels on Monday during a meeting of European foreign ministers that again reaffirmed the sanctity of diplomacy over force, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, stressed that Wednesday's talks in Minsk between the leaders of France, Germany, Russia, Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists needed to strengthen, not rewrite, September's so-called Minsk Protocol.But he acknowledged that fully putting it into effect was no longer an option because of what he called ""certain evolutions on the ground,"" namely a steady advance by pro-Russian fighters that has extended the territory they control by more than 200 square miles since September.In the weeks preceding Wednesday's Minsk summit talks, pro-Russian rebels, fortified by fresh supplies of Russian weapons, seized the ruins of the Donetsk airport and launched a determined offensive against the town of Debaltseve, an important rail junction and the last pocket of Ukrainian-held territory in a wide swath of territory north of Donetsk.The gap between Europe's dogged diplomacy and Mr. Putin's approach to Ukraine, which mixes regular calls for peace with stealthy supplies of Russian weapons and even soldiers to the separatists, has left Moscow and Brussels ""playing entirely different games,"" said Amanda Paul, a Russia expert at the European Policy Center, a Brussels research group.""Putin can outmaneuver us because he knows what our limits are. He knows we will not deploy troops. He knows that even if the United States decides to send some arms, Russia is still strong enough to defeat Ukraine,"" she added. ""But we have no idea what Putin's limits are. He does not show his cards. The West does. Maybe there is not a military solution, but we should keep Russia guessing.""While vague on his objectives in Ukraine beyond a determination to block what he sees as a plot by NATO to push deep into former Soviet territory, Mr. Putin has made clear his desire to divide the European Union, reaching out to countries like Hungary and Greece, where a new left-wing government has raised doubts about the wisdom of sanctions imposed on Moscow over Ukraine. So far, however, the 28-nation bloc has managed to stay unusually united, in part because it has stuck to relatively modest sanctions, in step with Washington.Linas A. Linkevicius, the foreign minister of Lithuania, one of the few European countries that support sending weapons to Ukraine, said, ""Diplomatic efforts are of course worthwhile, but we can't judge whether they are working, even if we get Russia's signature on an agreement. We have learned that we can only judge events on the ground.""""We cannot trust a single word of the Russian leadership,"" he added. ""They are all worthless.""The last Minsk agreement began to unravel almost as soon as it was signed. There were violations of the cease-fire on both sides, but particularly from the rebels, whose leader at the time, Pavel Gubarev, denounced the accord as a sellout and declared ""we want to spit on this 'peace.' ""Since then, the rebels have consolidated their previously fragmented land into a more defensible territory and have vowed to resist any return to a so-called ""demarcation line"" fixed in September. Mr. Fabius, the French foreign minister, indicated that France and Germany, which have taken the lead in Europe's diplomatic push, would accept revisions to the earlier accord, saying that it would be respected ""as far as possible.""An annual security conference in Munich last weekend was dominated by discussion about Ukraine and debate over whether Wednesday's peace talks would yield ""Minsk plus,"" a relaunch of last year's accord, or ""Minsk minus,"" a confirmation that the earlier agreement was dead and would be replaced by a new deal that enshrined the rebels' military gains.Skepticism was rife about the prospects for a deal that did not reward armed force, and the German government has been deliberately downbeat since, suggesting that the Minsk meeting not even take place and that if it did, hopes of an enduring settlement were slim.Asked whether it was more likely there would be a ""Minsk plus"" or a ""Minsk minus,"" Norbert Röttgen, the Christian Democrat who is chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the German Parliament, said he feared a minus from the Western standpoint.""I think there will either be nothing, because Putin unfortunately tactically has the upper hand in the short term,"" he said. ""And Poroshenko only has a limited amount of room to maneuver.""Or there will be a new cease-fire, a second Minsk, which would include a significant shift of the demarcation line to the West. The violation of Minsk 1 would then be honored in Minsk 2, and whether Putin would then keep to Minsk 2, there are considerable doubts,"" Mr. Röttgen added.Despite growing exasperation with Russia's meddling and its repeated denials of arms supplies, European nations have strong reasons to reject the idea of arming Ukraine, even with defensive weapons, and to rely solely on economic sanctions.""The only sector where Putin has nothing to fear is arms,"" Paolo Gentiloni, the foreign minister of Italy, said during an interview with The New York Times editorial board on Wednesday. ""Russia is weak in many sectors, but very strong in arms.""Any weapons sent to Ukraine by the United States, he said, might even help Mr. Putin as it ""could support his narrative"" that Russia has legitimate reasons to fear Western military encroachment on its borders.",0.0
Moving Fast to Share a Secret Language:   [Arts and Leisure Desk ],,"It was one thing for Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, a kid from New Jersey, to have 14,000 friends on MySpace at age 14 and 16,000 subscribers on YouTube at 18. But it's quite another for Halsey, Ms. Frangipane's pop-star alter ego, to have taken that innate 21st-century talent for self-presentation -- not to mention songwriting -- from her bedroom to arena stages in a mere year since signing with a record label.Instead of a viral flash of Internet lightning, Halsey, unfiltered and fast-talking, has been nurtured as an artist who could harness lasting loyalty online, not just one-off clicks. Now, with her nearly half a million followers on Twitter and more on Instagram contributing to the heavy lifting, the singer and her label -- Astralwerks, an electronic imprint under Capitol Music -- have set the stage for a potential mainstream breakthrough.With the release of her first album, ""Badlands,"" on Aug. 28, Halsey will attempt to translate the secret language she shares with her online followers for a wider audience without losing its essential intimacy. It's a rare tightrope walk pulled off by other web-driven artists like Lorde and Lana Del Rey.For Halsey, now 20, the next-level rollout includes television performances (starting with ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" on Aug. 25); a headlining fall tour that sold out almost immediately, resulting in upgraded venues and additional shows in major cities (including New York, where Halsey will play Webster Hall on Oct. 22 and 23); and -- her record company hopes -- at least one hit single, with bets currently placed on ""New Americana,"" a would-be generational anthem.[Video: Halsey - New Americana (Audio) Watch on YouTube.]But with ""Badlands,"" a brooding, conceptual electro-pop record with industrial undertones and big radio-ready hooks, Halsey has realized not just her label's vision but also her own. ""Being a pop-leaning, female artist, you'd think that I'd have my record company breathing down my neck and trying to control everything I'm doing,"" Halsey said while finishing ""Badlands"" in the spring. ""Actually, they've just kind of let me take the wheel.""The foundation, after all, was hers. In March, Halsey had her industry coming-out party at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Tex. But at an event all about manufacturing the appearance of buzz, Halsey's needed no fluffing: Amid the label types, teenage girls stood rapt at the front of a small stage, many of them holding up cellphones and beaming the performance via video chat to tearful friends at home.Outside the club, another cluster of young people pressed against a single window to catch a glimpse. By the festival's end, Twitter had named her most-tweeted-about artist, ahead of Miley Cyrus.""I remember walking into Capitol Records, sitting down with the executives and having them say, 'Look at what you did while none of us were paying attention,' "" Halsey said over bubble tea in the East Village in April. ""That was one of the proudest moments of my entire life. I put all the groundwork in myself, and they let me do my thing, because it's working.""""Ghost,"" Ms. Frangipane's first single as Halsey, was self-released on iTunes in January 2014, plugged to her tens of thousands of followers across social media. To Halsey, it was ""just another piece of content,"" she said. ""But now people who were quiet before and would just silently 'like' my pictures had something to engage with.""[Video: Halsey - Ghost Watch on YouTube.]The track exploded online, earning Halsey interest from five notable labels within days. She took some meetings but initially held out, and by late April, ""Ghost"" had found its way to SiriusXM's Hits 1 station, which played the independent single alongside songs by Lady Gaga and Pharrell Williams.Glenn Mendlinger, the senior vice president and general manager of Astralwerks, recalled hearing ""Ghost"" soon after at the label's weekly new music meeting. ""We have to find her immediately,"" he said. They did, and the next day, Mr. Mendlinger pushed back a flight to have an 11 a.m. meeting with Halsey.""By 1:30, I had sent an email to the entire executive team saying: 'I just met this girl. The music is phenomenal. She is a star. We have to get engaged immediately.' I was really enthralled,"" he said. ""It's what you wait for."" By 7:07 p.m., Astralwerks had offered her a record deal.Then it was time to slow down. ""It wasn't about going to radio immediately"" despite the early traction, Mr. Mendlinger said. ""If we had gone with 'Ghost' without any base behind it, we had a high probability of losing."" Instead, the plan was to record an EP -- Halsey's five-song ""Room 93"" was released in October -- get her on the road and continue building an online congregation.""We saw how she was already connecting, so we knew that was an avenue we needed to pursue with her,"" Mr. Mendlinger said of the singer's social media army, made up more of advocates than of passive fans.Halsey, who is preternaturally self-possessed and becomes gleeful in moments of defiance, slips into music-business-speak with the same ease with which she curses or describes her favorite websites. ""I cultivated this fan base that I really didn't really understand or appreciate until I put my first headlining tour up for sale,"" she said. ""500- to 1,000-capacity rooms weren't an underplay for me at the time. I'd never done a tour before!""Yet every date on that spring 2015 run sold out in less than 30 minutes, and Halsey soon graduated to an arena tour, opening this summer for the million-selling rock band Imagine Dragons and often packing the front rows despite being first on the three-act bill.""I come from a generation where these huge follower counts are normal,"" she said. ""But my interaction levels"" -- retweets, replies, click-throughs -- ""are incredibly high.""Halsey could be mistaken for a millennial built in a lab: Not only is she fluent in the language of modern marketing, but her openness on social media feels authentic and inextricable from her personality. Raised in Union County, N.J., by a white mother, who often accompanied her tween daughter to concerts, and a black father, who manages car dealerships, Halsey identifies as what she calls ""tri-bi"" -- biracial, bisexual and bipolar -- and speaks with ease and confidence about social issues.""Please don't erase my race because I'm white passing,"" she wrote on Twitter recently. ""There is literally nothing I can do about my complexion.""Her songs, which she writes herself with an array of young producers, are similarly candid and precocious. ""High on legal marijuana/Raised on Biggie and Nirvana/We are the new Americana,"" she sings. Although far from her most subtle song, ""New Americana"" was first played by the taste-making D.J. Zane Lowe on Apple's Beats 1 radio last month. ""Wow -- there's a new icon there, I think,"" he said after playing the track twice in a row. ""That record is big. Oh my God.""It soon spread to influential alternative stations like Live 105 in San Francisco and KROQ in Los Angeles. But Astralwerks may be taking a risk on rock radio, which sits outside Halsey's comfort zone. ""We know the fan base was leaning female and young,"" but alternative radio would introduce her to the 18-to-35 male demographic, Mr. Mendlinger said of that bet.Halsey is typically oppositional about the single's prospects. ""Everyone thinks it's going to be a cultural revolution, but I don't think it's that good,"" she said plainly. As for ""Ghost,"" which Astralwerks may yet push to pop radio, ""I'm so over that song,"" she said, and it only made the album as one of her few concessions to the label.More representative are songs like ""Hold Me Down"" -- ""I sold my soul to a three-piece/And he told me I was holy"" -- and ""Hurricane,"" an early track that made the deluxe edition of ""Badlands,"" on which she sings, ""I'm a wanderess/I'm a one-night stand/Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man.""[Video: Halsey - Hurricane Watch on YouTube.]Loaded with the knowingness of a cool older sister who sneaks into the city from the suburbs, Halsey's lyrics connected even before they were set to music. A breakup poem she wrote on Tumblr years ago has been ""liked"" and reblogged more than 820,000 times, taking on a viral life of its own (and even resulting in online plagiarism charges when she repurposed her own words as lyrics). At a Montauk hotel performance on Memorial Day, the Halsey faithful -- dyed hair, black lipstick -- stood out among the Hamptons regulars, singing every word. Some lingered for hours after the 20-minute show and burst into tears when Halsey's mother, who is recognized at every concert, told them the singer would visit with them soon.[Video: Halsey - Hold Me Down (Live Performance) (Vevo LIFT): Brought to You By McDonald's Watch on YouTube.]Upstairs in Halsey's room, a fan had sent roses. ""I'm not going to lie; it gets kind of intimidating sometimes,"" she said of the constant attention online and off. ""I put so much of myself out there and make myself so accessible that sometimes I fear I make myself too accessible."" When Halsey offered to get matching tattoos with fans recently as album promotion, those who were not old enough took offense.""I'm giving so much of myself now that there's going to be a point where there's nothing left to give,"" she said while chain-smoking Marlboro 27s. ""I'm on this skyrocket, with all these expectations and this fan base and this buzz. I have blessed myself and cursed myself by building something that people are so attached to. I get one shot.""A month later, at the Brooklyn stop of the Imagine Dragons tour, Halsey was visibly exhausted, having finished ""Badlands"" -- overseeing sound mastering, album art, videos and promo -- while playing arenas. ""My whole body hurts,"" she said backstage.Under the lights, though, she faced the fans' screams gamely, arching her back and spitting water onto those gathered up front for her early set. ""My name is Halsey,"" she told the crowd. ""But I'm not who you guys came here to see."" Even then, that didn't feel quite true.Photograph Halsey in Los Angeles Last Month, Just Before a Performance.

Cameron Plans Rise in Military Spending:   [Foreign Desk ],,"LONDON -- In a significant reversal of British government policy, Prime Minister David Cameron promised on Monday to bolster military spending, ending years of cutbacks that had prompted critics to claim that Britain was retreating from its global role.Announcing the outcome of a defense review, Mr. Cameron told lawmakers that his government would add 12 billion pounds, or about $18 billion, to the defense budget over the next decade, largely for military equipment, adding that such an investment was ""vital at a time when the threats to our country are growing.""The announcement, made 10 days after the terror attacks in France, came on a day in which Mr. Cameron also paid a brief visit to Paris, and promised the French government use of a British air base in Cyprus for France's air campaign in Syria.At present, British bombing raids against the Islamic State are limited to Iraq because of a vote in Parliament in 2013, but on Thursday Mr. Cameron will make the case to extend British airstrikes into Syrian territory.He appears anxious not to lose again on the issue, but with the opposition Labour Party divided over intervention in Syria, Mr. Cameron may decide that he could win a vote before Christmas.In the aftermath of the Paris assaults, Mr. Cameron had already announced plans to increase resources for Britain's intelligence agencies, and to invest in drones and special forces.But the spending plans announced on Monday will increase the broader capabilities of the British armed forces, which -- along with those of France -- are the only ones in Europe with a significant military reach. With the £12 billion increase, the defense equipment budget would rise to £178 billion, or $269 billion over the next decade.Britain's military has been stretched in recent years because of reductions made as the government has sought to stabilize the country's finances after the financial crisis.Those cuts prompted public criticism from Washington that Britain risked playing a reduced international role. Partly in response, London pledged this year to continue to meet a NATO target of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense.That decision set the tone for the defense review, which was published Monday to praise from defense experts.""This is much better for defense and for security than people were anticipating six months ago,"" said Malcolm Chalmers, the research director at the Royal United Services Institute, a research organization.""Over all, the message is that cutbacks have been reversed and some modest, but nevertheless significant, increases in defense and intelligence spending have been made,"" Mr. Chalmers said, adding that the decision signified a trend toward ""more global engagement.""Speaking in Parliament, Mr. Cameron promised to create two new rapidly deployable, 5,000-strong ""strike brigades"" by 2025, and to buy nine maritime patrol aircraft for surveillance, anti-submarine and anti-surface ship warfare. Mr. Cameron added that he would extend the life of the Royal Air Force's Typhoon aircraft for 10 years, to 2040, and stressed that the country faced ""state-based threats"" as well as those from terrorist groups.He also restated his intention to renew the Trident nuclear submarine system, a project which, according to the defense review, would cost £6 billion more than originally planned. Mr. Chalmers noted that the review had been conducted in the context of Russia's display of military assertiveness, which explained the decision to make anti-submarine capabilities a priority.The decisions announced on Monday will change the trajectory in defense expenditure. According to the Royal United Services Institute, government figures show a reduction in defense expenditure, between 2010-11 and 2014-15, from £44.3 billion to £34.4 billion in 2014-15 prices.Maria Eagle, who speaks for the Labour Party on defense issues, said the proposed budget increase would ""not undo the damage to our armed forces caused by the last one, when the government reduced the U.K.'s defense budget by 14.1 percent over the course of the Parliament.""""This is a government which, since coming to office, has left the U.K. with aircraft carriers without aircraft, without maritime patrol and with plummeting morale in our armed forces. We will therefore judge the government by its actions rather than its words,"" she added.Mr. Chalmers said it would be possible only with hindsight to judge whether the correct balance had been struck, and in light of the threats that emerge in the future. ""The test of this review will be in three years from now,"" he added.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

Obama Vows to Keep Doors Open for Refugees:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- President Obama vowed on Saturday to keep America's borders open to the world's refugees ""as long as I'm president,"" even as he met with child migrants and refugees here and his administration refused to yield in a long-distance feud with his critics over the issue.Mr. Obama chatted with elementary-school-age children, all sharply dressed in navy-and-white uniforms, at a humanitarian center that serves young people who have fled violence in Myanmar, Pakistan, Syria, Iran and elsewhere.They were representative of the faces of all the world's persecuted minorities, the president said, adding that such children must not be turned away by countries like the United States because of what he insisted was an unfounded fear of a terrorist threat from their presence.""They were indistinguishable from any child in America,"" Mr. Obama said after kneeling to look at their drawings and math homework. ""And the notion that somehow we would be fearful of them, that our politics would somehow leave us to turn our sights away from their plight, is not representative of the best of who we are.""A 10-day trip by the president to Turkey and Asia has been overshadowed by a relentless clash with governors, lawmakers and Republican presidential candidates about whether to block the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States.In the wake of the terror attacks in Paris, House lawmakers passed bipartisan legislation Thursday to drastically tighten screening for refugees seeking to enter the United States from Syria. Calls for restrictions on Syrian refugees have echoed across the political landscape, from Republican presidential hopefuls and governors to many lawmakers from the president's own party.The president and his aides have condemned what he called on Thursday a ""spasm of rhetoric"" among politicians. He accused Republicans in the United States of cowardice for seeking to block Syrian children and families who are fleeing the violent civil war in their country.""Apparently, they're scared of widows and orphans coming into the United States of America as part of our tradition of compassion,"" Mr. Obama said on Wednesday, adding a moment later: ""That doesn't sound very tough to me.""As Mr. Obama has participated in a series of economic summit meetings on this trip, White House officials have repeatedly sought to emphasize what they say is a comprehensive screening process for Syrian refugees that takes up to two years and includes interviews and biometric data to ensure that terror suspects do not enter the United States.In the president's weekly radio address, taped by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and released on Saturday morning, Mr. Biden insisted that refugees from Syria face ""the most rigorous screening"" of anybody entering the United States.""First they are fingerprinted, then they undergo a thorough background check, then they are interviewed by the Department of Homeland Security,"" Mr. Biden said. ""And after that, the F.B.I., the National Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Defense and the Department of State, they all have to sign off on access.""Administration officials have also sought to change the subject, telling reporters during the president's flight from the Philippines to Malaysia on Friday that the White House was open to discussions with lawmakers about tightening security for a separate program that reduces visa requirements for millions of people visiting the United States from certain countries.But the White House efforts have done little to quell the anxiety back home. The House bill increasing security for the refugee program passed by a vote of 289 to 137, with nearly 50 Democrats supporting it. That is a margin that might allow lawmakers to override Mr. Obama's promised veto if the bill also passes in the Senate.At the Dignity for Children Foundation in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, Mr. Obama knelt to talk to several children as photographers and television cameras captured the broad smiles on their faces.""What's your favorite subject?"" he asked, squatting beside a girl seated on a gray shag rug. ""Do you know what you want to be when you grow up?""The girl said she liked math and wanted to be an engineer when she grew up, prompting Mr. Obama to say, ""You're going to be an excellent engineer.""Most of the children at the center were members of the Rohingya minority who have fled persecution, discrimination and ethnic violence in Myanmar, officials said. White House aides said the United Nations had documented more than 153,000 refugees and asylum seekers in Malaysia, but they said the images of Mr. Obama in the center were designed to highlight the plight of refugees across the globe.In his remarks, the president said he hoped the recent elections in Myanmar, where Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won in a landslide, would help ease the humanitarian crisis in that country. In the meantime, he said, ""The refugees from Myanmar -- again, mostly Rohingya, mostly Muslim -- those young children up there, they're deserving of the world's protection and the world's support.""More broadly, he said, the United States should not turn its back on children from all over the world. He said America's role as a global leader was defined by its willingness to help people who have been discriminated against, tortured or subjected to violence.""That's American leadership,"" Mr. Obama said. ""That's when we're the shining light on the hill. Not when we respond on the basis of fear.""Mr. Obama is scheduled to return to the United States on Monday, when he is likely to face more debate about the refugee issue. He is also scheduled to meet on Tuesday with President François Hollande of France to discuss the terror attacks in Paris.Before leaving Asia, Mr. Obama spent some time on Saturday telling business leaders that the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal negotiated by 12 nations, including the United States, will improve the economy and security of Southeast Asia.Speaking to a business group before heading to the humanitarian center, Mr. Obama said he remained confident that Congress would approve the deal. And he said that nations in Asia should quickly do the same.""T.P.P. is more than just a trade pact; it also has important strategic and geopolitical benefits,"" he said. ""T.P.P. is a long-term investment in our shared security and in universal human rights.""""With T.P.P., we're not only writing the rules for trade in the Asia Pacific, we also have an historic opportunity to shape the future of the global economy,"" he said, adding: ""It says that America's foreign policy rebalance to the Asia Pacific will continue on every front.""Photograph President Obama with Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung of Vietnam at a Meeting in Malaysia.

Review: Dej Loaf Releases '#AndSeeThatsTheThing':   [Review ],,"DEJ LOAF""#AndSeeThatsTheThing""(Columbia)Every year since 2010 at the BET Awards, Nicki Minaj has been named best female hip-hop artist because, well, let's just say hip-hop has long been inhospitable to female talent in all its varieties. Simply to be heard, it can take exceptional gifts, like those possessed by Ms. Minaj. She is indisputably great, and in this particular arena, indisputably alone. During her acceptance speech this year, she acknowledged her fellow nominees, but focused on one newcomer, Dej Loaf, saying, ""You've been very, very interesting to me, and super, super forward.""Sixteen women have lost to Ms. Minaj in that category, but this was the first year when there was even a credible contender for runner-up. Dej Loaf, from Detroit, has a child's voice, round and small and not yet firm. Her breakthrough single, ""Try Me,"" which was released last year, sounded like getting threatened by a particularly needling child. ""I might catch a body,"" she sing-rapped, and it swung like a do-si-so.Since then, Dej Loaf has become a refreshingly chameleonic presence in hip-hop, slithering through songs about mean-mugging and songs about sweet loving. Her new EP, ""#AndSeeThatsTheThing"" -- her first major-label release of new material -- has some of both, her saccharine voice sometimes blurring the lines between them. (When she's rapping alone, her sneering is most alluring: gritty songs like ""Desire"" and ""We Winnin' "" easily outshine simple love declarations like ""Butterflies."")Most of the time, her soft and stretchy voice is spread atop oozing, shimmery production, and manipulated by machines; it's a toy to be fiddled with and molded. She meets her match here on ""Hey There,"" a hazy, undeniably sweet duet (produced by iRocksays with J. Vaughn & the A-Team) with Future. He, too, uses technology to extract deeper meaning from his voice. Together, they're like robots finally achieving sentience, androids melting into flesh and blood.Being a female rapper invariably means all manner of collaborations with men, many unwelcome and retrograde, but Dej Loaf has consistently used those opportunities to show new sides of herself, whether adding spooky kiddie menace to Kid Ink's ""Be Real"" or ride-or-die insouciance to the remix of Lil Durk's ""What You Do to Me."" But she has never been more impressive than on the remix of Omarion's ""Post to Be,"" one of this year's most salacious songs, and one on which Dej Loaf finally blends her aggression and her sensuality, asserting, ""I'm a pimp by blood, ain't no coaching me,"" and later, cleverly shrugging, ""I just got a checkup and ain't no ho in me.""On this EP, the duets are more balanced, be it ""Hey There"" or the rising hit ""Back Up,"" a back-and-forth with Big Sean. Both rappers are from Detroit, and the quickstepping song samples DJ Clent's ""Back Up Off Me,"" a ghetto house and juke anthem that was the first release on the Michigan label Juke Trax. Big Sean is a whimsical, witty rapper, and while Dej Loaf can't quite match his energy, she's happy to double his attitude: ""You got to promise not to stress me/ Don't be blowing up my phone and don't be leaving voice messages.""Photograph Photo",0.0
Comments:   [Travel Desk ],,"Early this month, several airplane passengers in Los Angeles who had boarded a Spirit Airlines flight to Dallas were kicked off the plane after an exchange over a seat that had been double-booked. (The passengers say the decision was racially motivated; the airline says it's looking into the matter.)Hundreds of readers had a lot to say about being kicked off a plane and about flying in general. Below are edited excerpts from their choicest comments.As airlines have forced passengers into smaller spaces and turned flying into a physical test of endurance, more passengers have gotten thrown off planes or otherwise become confrontational and angry. If I put you in a box and poke you with a stick enough times, what do you expect? What's changed in the last five years, airlines or humans?RYAN NEW YORKI've seen passengers behave with appalling rudeness toward flight attendants, and I've seen flight attendants on obvious power trips. But I don't think the problem is a general lack of manners in our society. The root of the problem is that everyone involved in a flight is stressed from overbooking and lack of personal space. Flying is miserable because more discomfort equals more profit. It doesn't excuse individual bad behavior, but when you make conditions more and more uncomfortable for people, it's inevitable that some of them will lash out at whoever's around them. Airline executives must have a good laugh as passengers argue about whether flight attendants or other passengers are to blame.BLUELOTUS LOS ANGELESMy mother was once seated in a seat where the previous passenger had had a urine accident. Her backside was completely wet. When she asked to switch seats, the flight attendants refused, so she stood at the front of her aisle and explained what happened in a voice that could be heard by other passengers on the plane. The airline threatened to eject her if she did not take the soiled seat. Thankfully, another passenger found her an empty seat, but I've always wondered whether the airline/flight attendants actually had the right to eject her in this situation.CRANE ANN ARBOR, MICH.I was traveling with 3-year-old twins when my son decided he didn't like his seatbelt. Nothing I did or said could help him understand that he had to keep it on. At the time, I didn't know that he had a serious hearing impairment and probably couldn't hear anything over the sound of the engines. I was eventually escorted off two different flights that day, which included enduring unbelievable hostility from other passengers. I am an extremely experienced traveler, but nothing prepared me for this. I would love to see airlines and passengers demonstrate some compassion toward parents. I now go out of my way to help any parent I see struggling in a plane or airport. I hope you will, too.AMANDA HARTFORDHaving flown in commercial airlines quite a bit, I have learned the following:1. Compliment the flight attendants. You'll get extra cookies or drinks.2. Behave, be polite and keep your mouth shut.3. Help women, older passengers and those with physical limitations with their luggage or other needs if it's convenient.4. Be patient. You'll all get there at the same time.All this works!DAVE ATLANTAAs a gate agent for a major airline, I've had to remove passengers from a plane. It's lousy for everyone involved. All I can say is, whatever got you to the point of being taken off a flight, it will not be resolved on the airplane. Once the flight crew and/or the gate agents have made their decision, you're off. The decision may change back at the gate, but that is unlikely. The only thing that will help you is to remain calm. Far, far easier said than done, especially in a cramped aluminum tube, but raised voices, belligerence and insults only hurt your case. Just be responsible, own your behavior, apologize for what you said or did (or what your mother would know) that was wrong, and be part of the solution, even if the airline/flight crew/agents made mistakes or a bad call.And this, too, applies to airline employees. I don't like to eat crow either, but my professionalism demands I admit my mistakes and make amends as best I can. Believe it or not, most of us in the industry love our work, and it distresses us when our passengers are unhappy. We want to help, but you have to help us help you!NICK MONTANAPhotograph Airline Passengers, Like These On an Allegiant Airlines Flight, Are Feeling More Stress, As Are the Crews.

France's Ambassador Has Shiny Cuff Links but Also Sharp Teeth:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- In the hours after the terrorist attacks in Paris left 130 dead, Gérard Araud, the French ambassador to the United States, thanked all Americans for their solidarity except for one: Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate who pointedly said that the mass shootings had occurred in ""one of the toughest gun control countries in the world.""Mr. Araud promptly pronounced Mr. Trump a ""vulture"" on Twitter. ""This message is repugnant in its lack of any human decency,"" he told his 27,500 followers.Mr. Araud deleted the post within an hour, deciding, he later said, that it was not the time for such sparring. But he makes no apology for the sentiment or the way he expressed it -- the latest example of how France's top diplomat in the United States relishes tossing out protocol when the interests of his country are at stake.""I'm a fighter, which for an ambassador is unusual, so I retaliated,"" Mr. Araud said this week during an interview in the Winter Salon of the grand Tudor Revival mansion that is his residence in Washington. ""I did it because it was just at the moment of the attack, so I was totally disgusted. I'm absolutely not ashamed of what I said.""Mr. Araud, 62, the first openly gay French ambassador to Washington and quintessentially French down to his (sterling silver) cuff links, relishes showing off his country's cuisine and culture at parties that bring together the city's top politicians, academics, business leaders, artists and writers. But he is the antithesis of a buttoned-up diplomat issuing scripted statements of harmony.Instead he is known as an effective and sometimes combative advocate for France.""He's a very talented, intelligent ambassador who serves his country well, but he knows how to throw an elbow,"" an Obama administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about Mr. Araud. ""On occasion, that has caused brief moments of friction.""He can be a strong negotiator, as was the case during intensive talks earlier this year between Iran and six world powers, including the United States and France, on a deal to lift sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbing its nuclear program. Mr. Araud criticized the emerging agreement, suggesting it was not tough enough, and publicly questioned whether a deadline at the end of June for striking it was binding. His words undercut what American negotiators regarded as critical leverage at the most sensitive of moments.""That was directly contrary to what we wanted to do, and it was unhelpful,"" said Philip Gordon, who until March was the top Middle East official at the National Security Council. But in an era when the United States and France have mostly common interests and have been aligned on strategic issues, he added, the bluntness can also be an asset.""He is refreshingly candid, and I stress 'refreshing,' because often diplomats can be quite cautious and ultra-diplomatic,"" Mr. Gordon said. ""I don't think anyone would say that about Gérard.""A former French ambassador to Israel, Mr. Araud's tenure in Washington has been punctuated by tragedy. He had been in the post only four months when masked gunmen stormed the Paris offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people.It was after that January attack that Mr. Trump originally sent the tweet about France's gun control laws, a message that was recycled in the wake of this month's carnage, provoking Mr. Araud's irate response. (Mr. Trump repeated the point after the latest attacks, during a speech Nov. 14 in Beaumont, Texas.)When he left his post as his country's ambassador to the United Nations to come to Washington, Mr. Araud worried on Twitter that his new assignment would compel him to ""be much more restrained."" Jeb Bush campaign officials might now see that as a needless concern.Last month when Mr. Bush remarked during a Republican presidential debate that the Senate's three-day schedule was akin to a ""French workweek,"" Mr. Araud was quick with a retort.""A French workweek of 3 days? No but a pregnancy paid leave of 16 weeks yes! And proud of it,"" he tweeted, later adding statistics pinpointing the French average of 39.6 hours per week of work. He called Mr. Bush's assertions ""bombastic nonsense.""Mr. Araud -- in between security briefings, receiving condolences for the victims, appearing in television interviews to talk about France's response to the attacks and planning for a hastily scheduled visit to the White House on Tuesday by President François Hollande of France -- has also taken time over the past week to comment on People magazine's selection of David Beckham as the sexiest man alive.""The only reason I see that I didn't make it is that he has more tattoos than me,"" he said on Twitter.At his residence in the Kalorama neighborhood of Northwest Washington, where classical portraits of the Marquis de Lafayette and the Count de Rochambeau mingle with modern canvases and photographs by his longtime partner, Pascal Blondeau, Mr. Araud said being outspoken on Twitter is part of being an effective ambassador in 2015.""It's in a way trying to reach more people, and also different people, and I try to do it in an engaging way,"" said Mr. Araud, who usually tweets from his car -- he has a driver -- or during the 15 minutes before he goes to sleep each evening.""I'm not worried about the consequence,"" he added, noting that he has long said the posting to Washington will be his last.He has little to lose, having risen to the highest echelons of French diplomacy. At the United Nations, where he served from 2009 to 2014, he embodied France's outsized influence as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, using the perch to cudgel and shame.He pushed for a vote on a measure to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court, knowing Russia would veto it, which was exactly the point -- to isolate the Kremlin. He goaded the United States to support an expensive peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic, where no country but France has any strategic interest.As a top foreign ministry official in Paris from 2006 to 2009, Mr. Araud was the lead negotiator on Iran for France, leaning on Russia to support new sanctions against Tehran for its nuclear activity, something Moscow resisted but ultimately backed.""What's really special about him is he's passionate, and in the sometimes dry world of diplomacy, where everyone's emotions are in check, Gérard can get passionate in a meeting, and he can get angry, and it's very effective,"" said R. Nicholas Burns, a former top State Department official in the George W. Bush administration who coordinated with Mr. Araud and officials from Britain, Germany, China and Russia in the nuclear effort. ""He was a tough inside player in holding that coalition together.""In the interview, Mr. Araud said he took no pleasure in offending his American counterparts or other colleagues, whether through a tweet or in the course of diplomatic maneuvering.""If I ever did it,"" Mr. Araud said with a faint smile, ""it was a mistake of my side, you know.""Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.",0.0

"Clinton Assails Bush, in Possible Trailer for '16:   [National Desk ]",,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Jeb Bush and his aides had envisioned a big, inclusive, high-minded speech about race on Friday in his home state of Florida, a chance to bring his message of colorblind opportunity to a prestigious group of African-American leaders.In a rare gesture of bipartisanship, Mr. Bush even planned to warmly quote President Obama, usually the object of his derision.Then Hillary Rodham Clinton stomped all over those plans.In a biting surprise attack, delivered as Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, waited backstage here at the annual convention of the National Urban League, Mrs. Clinton portrayed him as a hypocrite who had set back the cause of black Americans.It was an unexpected moment of political theater that seemed to presage what could be a bitter general-election rivalry between two of the biggest names in American politics.Mrs. Clinton, a Democratic candidate for president, latched onto Mr. Bush's campaign slogan and the name of his ""super PAC"" --Right to Rise, his shorthand for a conservative agenda of self-reliance and hope -- and turned it into a verbal spear.""People can't rise if they can't afford health care,"" Mrs. Clinton said to applause from conventiongoers, a dig at Mr. Bush's opposition to the Affordable Care Act.""They can't rise if the minimum wage is too low to live on,"" she said, a jab at his opposition to raising the federal minimum wage.""They can't rise if their governor makes it harder for them to get a college education,"" she said, a critique of Mr. Bush's decision as governor to eliminate affirmative action in college admissions.When Mr. Bush reached the lectern, declaring, ""I believe in the right to rise in this country,"" the scent of political gunpowder was still in the air.The assault on her Republican rival was all the more striking because the Bush and Clinton families make a point of highlighting their friendly ties: Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush appear on this week's cover of Time magazine.Mr. Bush appeared unprepared to respond, thanking Mrs. Clinton for joining him at the event but otherwise leaving her criticism unanswered in his own speech.Mr. Bush's aides, however, could barely hide their disgust over Mrs. Clinton's remarks, which they spoke of, bitterly, as uncivil and uncalled-for.On Twitter, Tim Miller, Mr. Bush's communications director, called it a ""Clintonesque move to pass over chance to unite in favor of a false cheap shot.""Allie Brandenburger, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, followed up with an email saying, ""The Urban League deserved better.""Despite the broadsides from Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Bush's speech was well received. He won applause when he recalled his decision to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the Florida Capitol in 2001. And he spoke emotionally of the massacre of nine black parishioners in Charleston, S.C., in June and of the forgiveness their survivors had expressed for the man charged in the shooting.""In the community of that city, we found such grace, such purity of heart, such heroic goodness, such boundless mercy, all gathered up in one story,"" Mr. Bush said.He quoted both the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mr. Obama. ""When President Obama says that 'for too long, we've been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present,' he is speaking the truth,"" Mr. Bush said to applause.But he did not directly address the rash of police shootings of unarmed black men that dominated discussions at the Urban League conference this week. Instead, he called more obliquely for rebuilding trust in ""America's vital institutions.""""That happens,"" he said, ""one person at a time. One politician at a time. One police officer at a time.""In her remarks, Mrs. Clinton took a more direct approach, ticking off the names of African-Americans who have died after interactions with law enforcement -- including Eric Garner, Walter L. Scott and Freddie Gray -- to knowing nods in the audience.""These names are emblazoned on our hearts,"" she said. ""We've seen their faces; we've heard their grieving families.""She spoke explicitly about racial discrimination, saying it still played a major role in determining ""who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind.""She added: ""We can't go on like this. We are better than this. Things must change.""Toward the end of her speech, Mrs. Clinton turned to those who, in her telling, do not live up to their own words on the subject of racial injustice, singling out Mr. Bush, not by name but by implication, over and over.Those attending the Urban League conference, who lean Democratic, took notice.Cherie LaCour-Duckworth, a Clinton supporter, said she had paid little attention to what Mr. Bush said. Mrs. Clinton, she said, ""set the stage for him.""Norma Richards, who traveled to the conference from Ohio, said she was struck by Mr. Bush's decision to talk about race so indirectly. ""He wasn't really strong about social injustice,"" she said.But her real objection to Mr. Bush, she said, stemmed from the presidential contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000, in which Florida played a decisive role. ""They stole the election,"" she said. ""I can't get that out of my head.""The conference Friday had offered a chance for Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who is challenging Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic nomination and has generated a loyal following among white liberals, to appeal more directly to black voters. But his speech highlighted just how much work he still has to do.At one point, Mr. Sanders begged for the crowd's indulgence to discuss his campaign platform before focusing on the ""save our cities"" subject of the gathering. But he called that ""your theme"" -- an off-key remark, and one that echoed a speech he made on Thursday, in which he twice referred to Latinos as ""your people"" before the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.Ben Carson, a Republican who was the sole black candidate to speak here, took a tough-love approach that seemed to inspire little enthusiasm from the crowd. Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, never mentioned the high-profile deaths of unarmed black men and women in police custody and held himself up as a model of how ambition and education could rescue poor African-Americans from poverty.He called on black parents to talk to their sons ""about how they conduct themselves.""""If you conduct yourselves in certain ways,"" he said, ""you are going to run into trouble, not only with law enforcement but with the guy down the block.""Herman Wallace, an attendee from Kansas City, Mo., was unmoved. ""Carson,"" he said, ""talked about himself.""Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.Photograph Above, Jeb Bush Addressed the National Urban League Conference On Friday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

Children Caught in a Racist System:   [Editorial ],,"The Justice Department cast the St. Louis County, Mo., law enforcement system in a harrowing light in March when it documented entrenched racism and unconstitutional policing in the town of Ferguson, which erupted in riots last year after a white police officer killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager.Now comes another Justice Department report, issued last week, documenting equally deplorable violations in the county's juvenile court system, where children, often without basic legal representation, are routinely railroaded and mistreated.The department opened the investigation in 2013 to protect the constitutional rights of children in the justice system and to discourage unnecessary incarceration. The department has undertaken similar investigations in Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas.In St. Louis County, officials examined 33,000 juvenile court cases over a three-year period and found that the system regularly treats black children more harshly than white children and routinely denies indigent children -- no matter their race -- basic constitutional rights.After controlling for relevant factors, including the severity of the offenses involved, a Justice Department analysis found that ""black children are subjected to harsher treatment because of their race."" For example, black children were two-and-a-half times as likely as white children to be held in custody before their trials.Black children were also more likely to be placed in the custody of the juvenile system than white children were and less likely to be diverted into community-based programs. White children were significantly more likely to get less restrictive sentences, like probation with services provided to them at home. This disparate treatment may not be intentional, but it is clearly racist in its effect.The Supreme Court has ruled that states must provide lawyers to defendants who can't afford them and that juveniles have the same rights as adults. But the very structure of St. Louis County's family court system seems designed to deny due process and representation.The children who go before the court do not get a truly independent advocate who looks after their interests. Investigators found that low-income children, who are legally entitled to court-appointed representation, are shortchanged at every turn.For starters, there is only one public defender for juveniles in the entire county. A result is a staggering caseload for that one lawyer, who cannot possibly meet the needs of hundreds of children. For some who are not eligible for the public defender's services, a family court judge will appoint a lawyer and order the parents to pay a ""retainer""; often, cash-strapped parents persuade a child that no lawyer is necessary. Moreover, more than half of the lawyers who represented detained children entered the cases many days or weeks after the child's detention hearing -- too late to be of much help.This appalling situation means that many juveniles are essentially representing themselves in complex legal proceedings that typically require them to plead guilty. Some of these children face the possibility of being transferred to adult courts, where a guilty verdict could have lifelong consequences. This is inconsistent with the Constitution and with basic principles of human decency.The report offers dozens of recommendations for remaking this egregious system, starting with developing a strategic plan that sets clear goals to end discriminatory treatment at all points. As part of that process, the court has to train its employees to understand ""the subtle ways that racial bias, conscious or unconscious,"" affects policy and practice, the report says.One absolutely essential step is for the county to create a defense system for poor juveniles that passes constitutional muster and affords them access to competent representation. The Justice Department should haul the county into court if it fails to make these changes.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",0.0
"In Rebuke to Kirchner, Argentines Elect Opposition Figure as President:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BUENOS AIRES -- Argentine voters handed a victory to Mauricio Macri in the country's presidential election on Sunday, delivering a mandate to an opposition political figure seeking to roll back some of the protectionist economic measures of the departing president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.With votes from 99 percent of polling places counted, Mr. Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires and a former president of Boca Juniors, one of Argentina's most popular soccer teams, was leading with 51.4 percent of the vote, according to election officials, against 48.5 percent for Daniel Scioli, a former speedboat racer and vice president under former President Néstor Kirchner, who died in 2010. Mr. Scioli conceded defeat on national television on Sunday night.Running a largely nonconfrontational campaign in a society that has grown increasingly polarized under Mrs. Kirchner, who succeeded her husband in 2007, Mr. Macri, 56, stunned the political establishment in October by forcing the race into a runoff and maintaining his surge in recent weeks. He ran to the right of his rivals, blending plans to overhaul the economy and promote the tolerance of various points of view on social issues.Mr. Macri's relatively narrow victory revealed deep fissures in Argentina after 12 years of governance by Mrs. Kirchner and her husband, with many voters expressing concern over the direction of the economy and frustration with Mrs. Kirchner's blistering attacks on critics in the news media, business establishments and rival political parties.""Cristina divided the country and destroyed it morally,"" said Dimitri Javakhishvili, 67, an immigrant from Georgia who works as a doorman at a building here in the neighborhood of Recoleta. Mr. Javakhishvili acknowledged that Mr. Macri could face challenges in trying to govern when Mrs. Kirchner's political movement moves into the opposition.Still, Mr. Javakhishvili said, ""At least he's something new; he's something fresh.""Not everyone here shares such views. Graffiti and posters have appeared across Buenos Aires demonizing Mr. Macri, outnumbering on many streets the campaign posters expressing support for Mr. Scioli, who balanced lukewarm support from Mrs. Kirchner's loyal followers with claims that social spending could be sustained despite galloping inflation and declining private investment.One example of anti-Macri sentiment, alluding to fears that he will govern for a privileged few, simply says ""Macrisis.""Mr. Macri, the scion of a wealthy family, has tried to combat perceptions that he would reverse the government's leftist policies, saying he will keep the nationalized companies like Aerolíneas Argentinas and YPF, Argentina's largest oil company, under state control. His economic advisers have also sought to tamp down fears around contentious economic issues like a potential currency devaluation.In addition to grappling with inflation and currency controls aimed at curbing capital flight, Mr. Macri will now face the challenge of governing with much of his opposition under the sway of Peronism, the ideologically diverse political grouping that has dominated Argentine politics for decades.Yet while Mrs. Kirchner's leftist faction has emerged as a dominant group within Peronism, with the president herself signaling that she planned to remain politically active after stepping down in December, Mr. Macri's margin of victory will help him in the months ahead, analysts said.""He will be able to start to work with authority,"" said Juan Cruz Díaz, a director at the Cefeidas Group, a political risk analysis firm. But he added that Mr. Scioli's performance still demonstrated the underlying strength of the Peronist political movement. ""It's not a devastating margin of difference,"" Mr. Díaz said. ""With a fatigued government and an erratic campaign, it's a good performance. They are far from dead.""Many political analysts in Argentina doubted that Mr. Macri would make it this far, with skepticism abounding when he began assembling his movement to the right of many rivals more than a decade ago.He ventured into a part of Argentina's political spectrum that had previously been associated with conservative Peronists or disgraced figures in the military establishment.But over time, he honed his negotiating skills as the mayor of Buenos Aires, while insisting during this year's campaign that he did not plan to roll back popular social programs introduced during the Kirchners' presidencies, like cash subsidies for poor families and ""Soccer for Everybody,"" a government initiative that covers soccer broadcasting fees so people can watch matches free.Mr. Macri seemed to gain the upper hand after mounting a door-to-door campaign that helped his supporters win important provincial and local races in October, including the prized post of the governor of Buenos Aires Province, now held by Mr. Scioli but won by María Eugenia Vidal, a top adviser to Mr. Macri and deputy mayor who focused largely on antipoverty programs in the municipal government.Many voters have also expressed fatigue with Mrs. Kirchner's governing style and reports of corruption among her prominent supporters.Signaling that she may not plan to remain subdued after leaving office, Mrs. Kirchner issued a torrent of messages on Twitter on Sunday celebrating her foreign and domestic policies. One message even seemed like a warning to Mr. Macri, who has vowed to improve Argentina's strained ties with the United States and review a contentious deal with China to build a nuclear reactor.""The person with the responsibility of leading the homeland should know the right place of the Argentine republic in a multipolar world,"" Mrs. Kirchner wrote.Mr. Macri's ""wager wasn't an easy one,"" the Argentine writer Martín Caparrós wrote in the Spanish newspaper El País. But Mr. Macri's ambitions were aided, Mr. Caparrós said, by ""12 years of rule by a couple that spoke as if from the left but acted in their own interests.""Some voters, however, said that their fears over the threats to the government's antipoverty programs outweighed criticism of the Kirchners or concerns that Mr. Scioli, viewed as friendlier to the business establishment, was not as radical as they had hoped.""I'm voting for the lesser of two evils,"" said Teo Levín, 25, a medical student who explained that he was voting for Mr. Scioli with gritted teeth. ""I understand that Scioli will adopt come conservative economic policies, but he won't destroy the political model. Macri will. He's the worst thing in the world.""Photograph Supporters of the Presidential Candidate Mauricio Macri Cheered in Buenos Aires On Sunday.

"Taiwan: Six Prisoners Kill Themselves, Official Says:   [Brief ]",,"Six inmates at a prison in southern Taiwan killed themselves Thursday morning, ending an overnight hostage situation, a Justice Ministry official said. Two prison staff members were released unharmed after being held for 14 hours at the Kaohsiung Prison, said the official, Chen Ming-tang, a vice minister in the Justice Ministry. The six inmates, who were all serving lengthy terms for crimes that included drug trafficking and murder, apparently complained about their living conditions to get a meeting with prison officials, whom they then took hostage on Wednesday, according to local news reports. The inmates later took firearms from a prison armory, Taiwan's Central News Agency reported. Taiwanese news outlets broadcast a series of demands from the men, including that they be provided with vehicles and that former President Chen Shui-bian, who was convicted of embezzlement and taking bribes in 2009, be returned to prison. Mr. Chen was released on medical parole in January. But early Thursday, the six inmates shot themselves, Mr. Chen, the ministry official, said in a brief televised interview. He provided few details about the episode.",0.0
"Paid Notice: Deaths CARRINGTON, KATHLEEN:   [Paid Death Notice ]",,"CARRINGTON--Kathleen. Kathleen Connell Carrington, 88, passed away peacefully on November 7, 2015 in Greenville, South Carolina. Kay, as she was known by her friends and family, was a steadfast and loving wife and mother. Born January 11, 1927 in Jersey City, New Jersey to John Norman Connell and Helen Burke Connell, Kay was one of nine children. Beautiful and unassuming, with an easy sense of humor and disarming smile, Kay graduated from Notre Dame College in Baltimore soon after the Second World War. Shortly thereafter she married Jim Carrington, a three-sport All-American, at the U.S. Naval Academy. In what has been described as a fairytale wedding, the midshipmen in their dress-whites rained rice upon the stunningly beautiful newlyweds as they ran beneath a shining arc of crossed sabers. Kay taught school until the arrival of the first of her five children, whom she raised in or near seaports around the world, from Yokosuka, Japan to Annapolis, Maryland. Like most Navy wives, while her husband was away at sea, often for months at a time, she stoically ran the householdwithout ever a complaint. Kay and Jim taught their children a great deal, but perhaps their most precious legacy was setting an example of how wonderful a marriage can be. As irony would have it, in the precise moment of Kay's sudden passing, all her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren were gathered together in California for the marriage of her grandson Michael. The thought would have pleased her to no end. Kay is survived by her daughters, Wendy Carrington, Nancy (Steve) Crown, and Kathleen (Steven) Anderson; sons, James Carrington, Jr., and Timothy (Cathleen) Carrington; sisters, Shelly Cullen, Madeleine Reilly, Elizabeth De Souza; brother, James Connell; ten grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews. She was preceded in death by her parents; husband James H.H. Carrington; sisters, Elise Leahy, Mary Lou Towey, and Nancy Bockus; brother, Jack Connell; and daughter-in-law Antonella Murgia Carrington. A service celebrating Kay's life is being planned for the spring of 2016.

WHY does the pro-choice movement so often find itself in a defensive crouch?I cringed as I watched Planned Parenthood's president, Cecile Richards, apologize in a YouTube video last month for the lack of ""compassion"" in two doctors' language at supposed business lunches arranged and secretly recorded by the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress.Not because she wasn't eloquent, but because of what her words said about the impossibly narrow path abortion providers now are forced to walk. After all, have you ever heard an apology from a crisis pregnancy center for masquerading as an abortion clinic? What about the women in Texas who lost access to gynecological care when the state defunded Planned Parenthood and did not, as promised, adequately replace its services? Has anyone said sorry about that?Logically, it's not important how doctors talk at supposedly private meetings. If they were heart surgeons I doubt it would be an issue. But these are abortion providers, and that makes all the difference. So far, the surreptitiously filmed videos, five of which have now been released, do not, as claimed, show that Planned Parenthood sells fetal tissue for profit, which is against the law.But the videos do cleverly evoke visceral feelings of disgust -- graphic images, physicians using the words ""crush"" and ""crunchy"" -- to activate the stereotype that abortion providers are money-grubbing baby killers.Why women end up having second trimester abortions, why they choose to donate fetal tissue, what good the research achieves -- who cares, when there is outrage to provoke and express?There are two reasons abortion rights activists have been boxed in. One is that we've been reactive rather than proactive. To deflect immediate attacks, we fall in with messaging that unconsciously encodes the vision of the other side. Abortion opponents say women seek abortions in haste and confusion. Pro-choicers reply: Abortion is the most difficult, agonizing decision a woman ever makes. Opponents say: Women have abortions because they have irresponsible sex. We say: rape, incest, fatal fetal abnormalities, life-risking pregnancies.These responses aren't false exactly. Some women are genuinely ambivalent; some pregnancies are particularly dangerous. But they leave out a large majority of women seeking abortions, who had sex willingly, made a decision to end the pregnancy and faced no special threatening medical conditions.We need to say that women have sex, have abortions, are at peace with the decision and move on with their lives. We need to say that is their right, and, moreover, it's good for everyone that they have this right: The whole society benefits when motherhood is voluntary. When we gloss over these truths we unintentionally promote the very stigma we're trying to combat. What, you didn't agonize? You forgot your pill? You just didn't want to have a baby now? You should be ashamed of yourself.The second reason we're stuck in a defensive mode is that too many pro-choice people are way too quiet. According to the Guttmacher Institute, nearly one in three women will have had at least one abortion by the time she reaches menopause. I suspect most of those women had someone who helped them, too -- a husband or boyfriend, a friend, a parent. Where are those people? The couple who decided two kids were enough, the grad student who didn't want to be tied for life to an ex-boyfriend, the woman barely getting by on a fast-food job? Why don't we hear more from them?It's not that they think they did something wrong: A recent study published in the journal PLOS One finds that more than 95 percent of women felt the abortion was the right decision, both immediately after the procedure and three years later. They've been shamed into silence by stigma. Abortion opponents are delighted to fill that silence with testimony from their own ranks: the tiny minority of women who say they're plagued by regret, rape victims glad they chose to continue their pregnancies, women who rejected their doctor's advice to end a pregnancy and -- look at these adorable baby pictures! -- everything turned out fine.Make no mistake: Those voices are heard in high places. In his 2007 Supreme Court decision upholding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy specifically mentioned the ""unexceptionable"" likelihood that a woman might come to regret her choice. That women need to be protected from decisions they might feel bad about later -- not that there was any evidence supporting this notion -- is now a legal precedent.It is understandable that women who have ended pregnancies just wanted to move on. Why should they define themselves publicly by one private decision, perhaps made long ago? I'll tell you why: because the pro-choice movement cannot flourish if the mass of women it serves -- that one in three -- look on as if the struggle has nothing to do with them. Without the voices and support of millions of ordinary women behind them, providers and advocates can be too easily dismissed as ideologues out of touch with the American people.Women aren't the only ones who need to speak up. Where are the men grateful not to be forced into fatherhood? Where are the doctors who object to the way anti-abortion lawmakers are interfering with the practice of medicine?On the issue of fetal-tissue research, we need to hear loud and clear from the scientific community. Anti-abortion activists are calling for a ban on this research, which ironically is used primarily to find treatments for sick babies. Will scientists let that happen?Planned Parenthood is big. It estimates that one in five women have visited its clinics for health care. But the implications of the video sting, and the congressional scrutiny Planned Parenthood now faces, are even bigger. They're about whether Americans will let anti-abortion extremists control the discourse and dictate the agenda around reproductive rights, medicine and scientific research. Silence, fear, shame, stigma. That's what they're counting on. Will enough of us come forward to win back the ground we've been losing?",0.0
"Quiet Time With Family, Food and Phone:   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"When Liz Lange's real estate broker sent her the rental listing for Grey Gardens, the famed East Hampton estate, her eyes nearly popped out. Ms. Lange, a fashion designer who sold her maternity-wear business in 2007 but remains its creative director, had long been captivated by the decaying mansion and its eccentric former residents, Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter, Edie, who were immortalized in a 1975 documentary and who are also the subjects of a 2006 Broadway musical being revived this month at the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor. Ms. Lange was also obsessed with the house's subsequent renovation by the journalists Sally Quinn and Ben Bradlee. ""There's history in that house,"" she said. She rented it, and Ms. Lange, 48, who lives on the Upper East Side, is spending extended weekends at Grey Gardens this summer with her fiancé, a lawyer; her children, Gus, 16, and Alice, 14; and their Goldendoodle, Rosie.ELECTRONIC SLIDE I sleep tethered to my phone. I put it, actually, under my pillow. I get up around 6. I slide out my phone, I start answering emails. I know people think it's bad, but truthfully, I feel like since I started my business, customers are everything. Maybe Target customers, who we call ""guests,"" maybe they have questions. I love to answer them all personally. I'm not going to pretend that I don't stay on it all day -- I do.HOT DIP I can't really start my day unless I take a bath. I do it a lot during the day. They're very quick. Someone once called me ""the human tea bag"" because I get in, I get out. I like scalding hot, but just for a minute.MUFFIN RUN I'm a baked-goods fanatic. There's this bakery in Wainscott -- it's called Levain. They have incredible blueberry muffins. They make a certain amount in the morning. People line up out the door. So I run out to Levain in my car, which I love to do because I never drive in the city.SUN-FILLED NOOK There's this incredible sunroom with all glass doors leading to the gardens. I like to sit in that sunroom. Often my fiancé will join me. We'll read the papers, we'll eat muffins, we'll have coffee. At a certain point, the kids will wake up. I'm not such a great cook but I do this thing where I make my daughter and her friends homemade crepes. I even bought this special crepe maker.BOOKS, FAMILY My fiancé and I will take Rosie on a walk. We often run into people. To me, New York and East Hampton are like a small little village. My sister and her husband and their children, who are best friends with my children, are in Amagansett. Sometimes we'll go there for lunch. I might be reading, checking my emails, checking my Instagram feed, commenting on things. I read for fun. I devour books.CITY BOUND When we are home in time, we go to Sette Mezzo for dinner. It's almost like our second kitchen. I have been going there on Sunday nights -- first with my parents and sister, and now with my fiancé and children -- since I was a child. My entire family goes as often as we do, so I'll usually run into a cousin or an aunt.HAPPY PLACE Around 10, I get into bed. I'll start binge TV-watching, which I can do until 1 in the morning. I'm obsessed with cheesy -- especially the ones that were made a long time ago, Lifetime and Hallmark movies. Obsessed. My favorite thing is when there's an actor who's become famous. There's one about a gay man coming out. It's called ""Doing Time on Maple Drive."" Jim Carrey is in it and I love Jim Carrey. That's my happy place. My pillows are propped up, I'm scrolling through my DVR, I've got my laptop on my lap and I've got my phone next to me.WORKING FOR THE WEEKDAY I can't imagine my life not working; I love it. I'm very excited for Monday morning to come. I think if you saw me walking down the street, wouldn't you think, ""I have nothing in common with her. She's a primate of Park Avenue?"" I'm not. I've worked since I was 21. My children always tease me and say, ""You have no friends, Mom."" I'm kind of a workaholic. I don't do a lot of turnoff.#SundayRoutine readers can follow Liz Lange on Twitter @lizlange or on Instagram @lizlangeofficial.Photograph (Photographs by Nicole Bengiveno/the New York Times)",0.0

"When Bad Guys Escape, Cops Brood:   [Review ]",,"THE WHITESBy Richard Price writing as Harry Brandt333 pages. Henry Holt and Company. $28.""The Whites,"" the title of Richard Price's riveting new novel, is a reference to the great white whale in ""Moby-Dick"" -- a book that seems to be a kind of touchstone for the author (writing here under the pen name Harry Brandt), having popped up, at least glancingly, in such earlier novels as ""Clockers"" and ""Freedomland."" This time, the parallels to Melville's classic are beyond obvious: All of the story's main characters are haunted by something terrible that happened in the past, and all are obsessed with hunting down their nemeses.These characters are all cops or former cops (who, ""starting out in the late '90s, had christened themselves the ""Wild Geese""), and as Mr. Price has demonstrated in his earlier novels and episodes of the HBO show ""The Wire,"" he not only has a visceral ability to convey the gritty, day-to-day realities of their jobs, but also a knack for using their detective work the way John le Carré has used spy stories and tradecraft, as a framework on which to build complex investigations into the human soul.The story architecture here is based on these characters' Ahab-like quests to settle scores with their personal ""Whites"" -- ""those who had committed criminal obscenities on their watch and then walked away untouched by justice"": the sexual predator who bludgeoned to death a 12-year-old; the ringleader of a white street gang who, in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, chased a Pakistani boy into an oncoming car; the man who murdered a college-bound basketball player for making him look bad in a pickup game; a small-time felon who fatally stabbed a ninth grader who had talked to his girlfriend at school.This premise may sound a little strained, but Mr. Brandt immerses us so fully in his characters' lives that the larger contrivances almost completely fall away. No one has a better ear for street language than he (er, Richard Price) does, and no one these days writes with more kinetic energy or more hard-boiled verve. His high-impact prose is the perfect tool for excavating the grisly horrors of urban life: a panic-stricken boy, ""running blindly across the four-lane northbound parkway,"" struck ""by a muscle car doing 65, the sound of the impact"" loud enough ""to set off car alarms for blocks around."" And his ability to map his characters' inner lives -- all the dreams and memories and wounds that make them tick -- results in people who become as vivid to us as real-life relatives or friends.Billy Graves, the hero of ""The Whites,"" is the head of a team of detectives in charge of covering ""all of felony-weight Manhattan from Washington Heights to Wall Street between 1 a.m. and 8 a.m.""; his ""White"" is one Curtis Taft -- the coldblooded killer of a woman, her daughter, and her niece -- whose whereabouts Billy has recently tracked down.Though there is a dark episode in his past involving the accidental and near-fatal shooting of a 10-year-old Hispanic boy in the Bronx many years ago, Billy is a good-hearted, weary-souled fellow with what he thinks of as a ""flatline personality."" It is Mr. Brandt's achievement that he takes Billy's ""bland stolidness"" (which might have been merely boring in the hands of another novelist) and gives us a character as immensely real and sympathetic as Mr. le Carré's George Smiley -- that is, if Smiley were a New York cop.Mr. Brandt conveys the daily grind of Billy's life, one trouble stacking upon the next like piled firewood -- including worries about his tempestuous wife, Carmen; his aging father's dementia; his two beloved sons' safety -- and the exhausting mix of adrenaline and doggedness that his job demands. He captures the odd battlefield rhythms of being a detective: the nights when it was ""nothing but softballs"" and the nights when it's coming in hot and heavy, one horrifying crime after the next, one devastated family after another.To build further tension, Mr. Brandt deals out one more terrible card to poor Billy: a stalker (""big, fast and devoid of mercy"") nearly as sadistic and relentless as Chigurh, the chilling villain in Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, ""No Country for Old Men,"" who has been watching Billy's home and following members of his family.The suspense has little to do with the identity of this stalker -- we're clued in, early on, to who he is -- but with whether he will succeed in exploding Billy's family, and the complicated and long-ago reasons behind his own Ahab-like quest for vengeance. Mr. Brandt does not turn this man into a factory-issue bad guy or a symbol of irredeemable evil, but rather seeks to humanize him, to dramatize the terrible losses that fuel his anger and the internal conflicts he feels, as he's pulled between his need to avenge the terrible wrongs done to his family, and his love for his young daughter, whom he knows he will lose if he completely embraces the dark side.The rest of the characters in ""The Whites"" are delineated with similar emotional gradations. Mr. Brandt chronicles the fraternal bonds among Billy and the surviving members of the Wild Geese that have endured despite ups-and-downs over some two decades, even as most of them have moved on to new lives.Redman Brown, having been shot through the hips in a hostage situation, now runs his father's funeral parlor in Harlem; Jimmy Whelan has become an itinerant building super, living year to year ""in some of the finer basement apartments of the city;"" Yasmeen Assaf-Doyle quit the force to take a security job at a university in Lower Manhattan; and Billy's former partner, big John Pavlicek (nearly large enough ""to have his own ZIP code""), having played ""the exit game"" to perfection, made a bundle buying former crack squats, rehabbing them and flipping them in New York's booming real estate market.""The Whites"" doesn't give the reader the keen sense of changing class and race lines that Mr. Price's 2008 novel, ""Lush Life,"" did, but its sure sense of the rhythms of New York -- the ""general malice"" out there that often kept Billy busy all night and the occasional acts of grace and kindness that help redeem the wearying grind -- lend the Melvillian travails of its characters a local name and habitation. Despite its occasional lumps, this novel is, at once, a gripping police procedural and an affecting study in character and fate.Photograph Photo (C1); Richard Price (Photograph by Lorraine Adams) (C6)",0.0
"An Indictment Is Made, but Residents Stay Wary:   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"Akai Gurley carried no weapon, they said. All he did was step into a darkened stairwell.And the police officer who shot him? Time to bring him to justice, the men and women of the Louis H. Pink Houses in Brooklyn said over and over on Tuesday evening, after learning that Officer Peter Liang, whose bullet killed Mr. Gurley in November, would be indicted on charges including second-degree manslaughter.""He needs to answer to the family, to the community,"" Maritza Ruiz, 45, said. ""There's a young man dead.""Officer Liang, 27, shot Mr. Gurley while patrolling a stairwell at the Pink Houses in East New York less than 18 months into his career with the Police Department.Officer Liang was arraigned on Wednesday afternoon. Shortly before 7 a.m., he stepped out of his home in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Wearing a dark suit and gray tie, he made his way into a waiting S.U.V. and did not respond to questions from a reporter.Like other residents interviewed on Tuesday at the Pink Houses, Ms. Ruiz said she could not stop thinking about how the officer, by drawing his gun, had endangered untold lives in a building where many residents take the stairs because the elevator is unreliable.""It could've been me; it could've been my daughter,"" she said. ""You don't walk into a building with a gun loaded where a lot of innocent people live.""But for several residents, the indictment of Officer Liang -- coming after grand juries in Ferguson, Mo., and on Staten Island declined to indict white officers in other deaths of unarmed black men -- only underscored how capricious justice could be.How could they have faith in the system, they asked, if it seemed to value their lives only intermittently?""How can you be lenient on this one, and hard on the other one?"" said Robert Martin, 46, who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant but was passing the Pink Houses on Tuesday. ""The other cops who shot people should get the same.""For Gregory Rosario, 24, the confusion about what exactly had happened in the stairwell made it all the more ironic that Officer Liang, a Chinese-American, was the only officer who would face charges.""You think if the officer's not a minority, he would get indicted?"" said Mr. Rosario, who grew up in the Pink Houses. ""If he was Caucasian, he wouldn't be indicted. In Eric Garner, they had everything on the table and they didn't do anything. Here there's no video, no proof, but they indicted him.""Police Commissioner William J. Bratton has acknowledged that the shooting was a grave error, and police officials have said it was an accident. But residents said a lack of intent did not make the shooting less frightening.""I just don't understand: Why would he draw his weapon like that?"" Adam Davis, 28, said. ""He should never draw his gun out if he wasn't sure there was a problem.""Mr. Gurley's death has brought spikes of noisy bustle to the Pink Houses -- the bright lights of television news vans, the roar of protesters -- but it has also left the housing project quieter, making children afraid to take the stairs or play outside, Mr. Davis said.Kamala Crew, 43, a seamstress, said she sympathized with Officer Liang.""I'm sorry for who died, but he was a rookie, and he's not accustomed to this lifestyle,"" she said. ""This is so sad. I know cops that did worse than this and got away scot-free.""Ultimately, many of her neighbors said, the indictment could never resolve the broader issues of race and police violence that have defined their debates and aroused their community for many months now.All the indictment represented, they said, was the first step toward closing the case of Mr. Gurley, their friend.""He was a good guy,"" Margarita Robles, 40, said. ""Would I say this is justice? Yes.""Photograph Adam Davis On Tuesday Outside the Brooklyn Housing Project Where a Police Officer Fatally Shot Akai Gurley in November. (Photograph by Chang W.

Red Sox Quickly Go From Lifting Trophy to Raising Doubts:   [Sports Desk ],,"Another member of the brotherhood left the family just before game time on Wednesday. Daniel Nava, an outfielder on the Boston Red Sox' 2013 championship team, was claimed on waivers by Tampa Bay. The Red Sox cut him last week, when he was hitting .152.So it goes for the Red Sox, whose latest title seems more and more like a fluke with each succeeding last-place finish. Only six players from the World Series roster remain active for the Red Sox, with three others on the disabled list and the rest scattered in and out of the game.""I talk to my friends about it; I talk to everyone about it -- I don't ever think that could be duplicated, that team, just the chemistry,"" first baseman Mike Napoli said by his locker at Yankee Stadium before batting practice.""We got to spring training, Day 1, I didn't know anybody in here; a lot of guys didn't. But it was weird, just from the beginning, how we all had the same interests. There were a lot of different personalities, but we were all the same, in a way -- we all cared for each other, picked each other up. It was just so special.""The Red Sox, with a sense of purpose made stronger by the Boston Marathon bombing that April, rolled into October, taking down the Rays, the Detroit Tigers and the St. Louis Cardinals. It was a third championship ring for the owner John Henry, and the one that got away from Mike Ilitch, his counterpart with the Tigers, whose bullpen blew two leads at Fenway to cough up a pennant.On Tuesday, Ilitch fired Dave Dombrowski, the Tigers' president and general manager, icily referring in a statement to ""some success"" that Dombrowski had achieved. Some success, indeed -- the Tigers were a laughingstock before the arrival of Dombrowski, who won two pennants and the last four American League Central titles.That was not enough to save Dombrowski's job, but then, the Red Sox are not satisfied, either. They got the championship that has eluded Detroit, but it buys them no good will from their fans.""In Boston? No,"" Napoli said, laughing. ""That's the beauty of this place, and that's what I love -- you're expected to do good every year. There's an expectation of playing well and making it to the playoffs, which I like. It could be the best place to play, and when you're not doing so well, it's tough.""Tough is an understatement. Before their 2-1 victory Wednesday behind the knuckleballer Steven Wright, the Red Sox (48-60) had held the worst record in the A.L. Only one team in the majors, the Colorado Rockies, had allowed more runs. Only one team, the Philadelphia Phillies, had a worse run differential.Very likely, this will be Boston's third last-place finish in the last four seasons, and the fifth time in six years that the Red Sox miss the playoffs. Larry Lucchino, the president and chief executive, announced on Sunday that he would transition to a reduced role after this season, with Sam Kennedy becoming team president. Now Dombrowski is a free agent.Henry has expressed strong support for General Manager Ben Cherington, and it is hard to imagine Henry adding another highly paid executive position for Dombrowski -- say, president of baseball operations -- above Cherington.But at the very least, the Red Sox must re-evaluate the decision-making process that led to their latest failure. The list of dubious decisions is getting long:Essentially turning Jon Lester into Rick Porcello, whose 5.81 E.R.A. is the worst among qualified starters in the A.L. and whose four-year, $82.5 million contract begins next season.Trading John Lackey (and his $500,000 contract for this season) to St. Louis for outfielder Allen Craig, who is in the minors, and starter Joe Kelly, whose stuff may be best suited for a relief role.Spending $72.5 million for seven years on outfielder Rusney Castillo, who has just 100 at-bats this season and did not start the first two games of this series.Spending $88 million for four years on Hanley Ramirez, who has made a shaky transition to left field and has only 28 extra-base hits this season.Spending $95 million for five years on Pablo Sandoval, who stopped switch-hitting after going 2 for 41 as a right-handed batter -- and has fewer extra-base hits than Ramirez (26), even after doubling twice on Wednesday.""We've got to get information on players that are going to be here beyond 2015,"" Manager John Farrell said, explaining the remaining goals for this season. ""That's veteran and young players alike. We've got to improve our team defense. That's a priority.""We have an obligation as players and as staff to our fans to put forth the effort each and every night with the intent to win,"" he added. ""But internally, our decision making's got to come from how do we improve our team defense, and what information do we get on the young players and the players that will be here beyond 2015?""The easy answer, at least on Castillo, would seem to be to simply play him every day and see how he does. Farrell said Castillo would start on Thursday and Friday, but he said he still must find at-bats for veterans like Napoli (.209 with 13 homers) and outfielder Alejandro De Aza, who was designated for assignment by Baltimore in May but has hit well for Boston.With the rookie Mookie Betts recovering from a concussion, Farrell said Jackie Bradley Jr. would continue to get a long look in center. Bradley is an elite defender but is hitting .102 (5 for 49) this season, his third in a row under .200. ""I think they already know what I can do,"" Bradley said. ""I'm just trying to win; that's my main focus.""Trying has not been the problem for the Red Sox. They have spent money, revamped their roster, and flopped twice since their World Series triumph. All that remains is a two-month petri dish to study.So there will be more tests for rookie starters like Wright, Henry Owens and Eduardo Rodriguez. There will be more answers, perhaps, on Bradley, Castillo and catcher Blake Swihart. And there will surely be more distance from the glorious mirage of 2013.Photograph Boston's Hanley Ramirez in July.

Metropolitan Diary:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"DEAR DIARY:My wife and I were walking down Fifth Avenue toward St. Patrick's in late October after having peeked in on the beautiful architecture of St. Thomas a few blocks north, when the bells from the Episcopal church began sounding the half-hour.A short while after they stopped, the bells of the Catholic cathedral signaled the same half-hour mark.I immediately wondered whether this was just a case of each church's keeping its own reckoning of the proper time, or whether there was an implicit agreement in the spirit of Christian charity for each denomination to let the other sing a solo to passers-by twice each hour.Michael L. MillensonDear Diary:On Valentine's Day in 1957, I moved into a friend's one-bedroom, $34-a-month apartment at 320 East 57th Street. My roommate was a featured dancer in Broadway shows and a pioneer choreographer for television. After a 47-year partnership, he passed away.At that time people had answering services. Ours was called the Belles, operated nearby by two sisters. It catered to people who worked in the theater, many famous. Betty Comden and Adolph Green, the well-known musical comedy writers, were among the customers. Another was Judy Holliday, a major stage and screen star. The trio produced a very successful musical called ""Bells Are Ringing,"" based on the Belles.Some months ago, I stopped by a piano bar in the neighborhood where I occasionally sing. I should not, given my lack of talent and my penchant for forgetting the lyrics of songs. I told my ""Bells Are Ringing"" story and then launched into the final song, ""The Party's Over.""When I finished to a sitting ovation, a gentleman came over and handed me his card. ""I own the Belles,"" he said. Flabbergasted, I said, ""You mean there are people who use such a service after 60 years and answering machines?"" He told about his operators on the East and West Coast. We met again shortly after. To my delight, he looked up my friend's name and found that he was a customer during the 1950s and 1960s.A very nice coincidental encounter. William J. SchneiderDear Diary:When I was a high school senior, I don't remember anyone making a big fuss over college admissions. In fact, what I remember most about senior year was shopping with my mother for my college wardrobe, walking around Greenwich Village with my friends and slow dancing to '50s rock 'n' roll in dark living rooms.And I surely don't remember writing my college essay, because in fact my father wrote it. I don't remember why; I guess I was just too busy trying on clothes at Loehmann's, wandering around the Village and dancing to the Platters.My dad went to N.Y.U. Heights and loved it, and was sure I'd love it too, so he sat down one night and wrote my essay. I think the gist of it was, ""My dad went to N.Y.U. Heights and loved it, and I'm sure I will, too.""Well, apparently it did the trick because I got in. And of course I did love it, and not for a minute did I feel guilty about that ghostwritten essay.In 1973, nine years after I graduated, New York University closed its arts and engineering schools at University Heights and sold the buildings and grounds to CUNY. My old alma mater then became the new, leafy campus of Bronx Community College.I guess some things change.Years later, when my son was too busy studying his Torah portion, my husband sat down one night and wrote the kid's bar mitzvah speech.I guess some things never change. Dana LehrmanDear Diary:The falling leaves,Summer's canceled checks.Jack SauterDear Diary:We decided to meet at Mayahuel; it was odd, because he loathed avocado.Later, we got lost in a public make-out at Penrose followed by a candlelit dinner at Jones Wood Foundry.And then, as it usually goes, I was ""ghosted."" Four months later, the night before the Brooklyn Half-Marathon, he texted, ""Carbo-load?""I thought, sure. I've never been one to turn down pasta. I asked, ""What happened?""And just when you think you've heard it all after countless swipes and train-wreck dates: ""You don't read enough,"" he said. ""So I don't see this going anywhere.""Well, this was new. I'm in P.R. and have built my career off reading and knowing what is being written about. Who did this alleged bibliophile think he was?I left dumbfounded, wondering if I should go pick up ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or a bottle of Tito's.We never spoke again until a random Thursday just past 1 a.m., when an email from him with the following subject line graced my inbox:""Congratulations, you have been gifted a subscription to The New Yorker.""Was this the most passive-aggressive move in the history of casual dating or an unusually cruel, perhaps drunken dig at my illiterate self?A year later I received a job offer in Chicago. Right before I left, I saw him on the other side of the 6 train platform at Grand Central. He didn't see me; his face was buried in that week's issue of The New Yorker.I transferred the subscription to Chicago. I longed for any remnants of New York City in the Midwest.

"A Painter and Places, in Hamptons Close-Ups:   [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDED. Decades before the East End in Long Island became a crowded mecca for summertime vacationers, the Hamptons and their neighboring villages were quiet, rural getaways for artists, from the American Impressionists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries to the Pop artists of the '60s. Visual art still has a lively presence in the area, as viewers can discover at two of the region's pre-eminent destinations.Start with the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center, in East Hampton. Say you want to make a romantic biopic that evokes the New York art world in the era encompassing the rise of its bohemian avant-garde in the 1930s and '40s and the pluralist '70s and '80s. Who would your protagonist be? You can stop scratching your head. No one would be more suitable than the painter, writer and teacher Elaine de Kooning (1918-1989), the subject of ""Elaine de Kooning Portrayed,"" a sweet, small show of self-portraits and portraits of her by others at the center, which occupies the home where the Abstract Expressionists Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner lived in the late 1940s and early '50s.Tall, slender, beautiful and effervescently personable, Ms. de Kooning would be best played by a contemporary equivalent of Katharine Hepburn -- say, Cate Blanchett. In the late '30s, she took lessons from Willem de Kooning before becoming his lover and then wife. She hung out with the mostly male cast of argumentative characters at the Cedar Tavern and held her own in both the talking and drinking departments. She went on to forge a career in the '50s and '60s as a painter of Expressionistic portraits of luminaries like the poet Frank O'Hara, the dancer Merce Cunningham and, to fulfill a commission from the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library, John F. Kennedy. She also wrote prolifically about art and held various university teaching positions.She knew everyone in the New York art world, and she took many as lovers, the critics Harold Rosenberg and Thomas Hess among them. For a couple of decades, she and Mr. de Kooning lived separately but never divorced. Then, in 1976, he asked her to help him get what was by then his chaotic life in order. She bought a house near his in Springs, in East Hampton, and looked after him until her death from lung cancer in 1989, shortly after opening a show of large canvases at the Fischbach Gallery inspired by the cave paintings of Lascaux, France. Mr. de Kooning died eight years later.Timed to coincide with an exhibition of Ms. de Kooning's portraits at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, and organized by the center's director, Helen A. Harrison, the show's 18 works hang in the former living quarters of the small, shingled house, which is still furnished as it was when Pollock and Krasner lived there. It's an intimate setting for what amounts to a single collective portrait.Ms. de Kooning's self-portraits, all of herself in her studio in 1946, are outstanding. They include two carefully observed ink drawings and two small paintings in muted colors that blend realism, Cubism and Surrealism with a deft touch.Mr. de Kooning's exquisitely penciled ""Portrait of Elaine"" (1940-41), one of his most widely reproduced drawings, is here along with a similarly magical, neo-Classical drawing by Hedda Sterne from 1953. There are also sketchy drawings by Arshile Gorky, Robert De Niro Sr. and Aristodimos Kaldis.A nearly life-size painting of the artist made by Fairfield Porter in 1957 shows her sitting in a red dress and brown overcoat on a floral-patterned sofa, a picture of relaxed elegance. An unusually poignant 1965 painting by Alex Katz focuses on her eyes. She seems tired and pensive, maybe because she had recently quit drinking after many years of overindulging.Edvard Lieber, a close friend who became the executor of her estate, created a mixed-media abstraction on paper called ""Point: Elaine de Kooning in Central Park"" in 1979. Looking closely, you can see the ghosts left after he removed snapshots of Ms. de Kooning that once adhered to the page. A small valentine heart drawn in pencil on a folded sheet of computer paper by the collagist Ray Johnson is dated 2-1-89, the day she died. It's a sad, loving tribute.The other primary East End destination for the art-historically curious is the Parrish Art Museum, founded in 1897 by Samuel Longstreth Parrish (1849-1932) in Southampton to display his collection of Italian Renaissance art and copies of Greek and Roman sculpture. In 2012 the museum moved into a big, chic shed of a building in nearby Water Mill that was designed by the architectural firm Herzog & de Meuron.Exhibitions at the Parrish often have focused on artists who have lived in or regularly visited the East End. Departing from that tradition, this summer's show, ""Andreas Gursky: Landscapes,"" presents photographs by the internationally celebrated German artist. (By a curious coincidence, Mr. Gursky lives and works in a former industrial building in Düsseldorf, Germany, that was rehabilitated by Herzog & de Meuron.)When Mr. Gursky's immense photographs first began appearing in New York galleries in the 1990s they were terrifically exciting for their sheer size and for their implicit commentaries on capitalist globalization. But then came a flood of oversize photographs by others like Thomas Struth, Thomas Ruff, Candida Höfer and Gregory Crewdson and by legions of those artists' imitators. Now such large, overproduced pictures, including Mr. Gursky's here, have about them the stale air of white elephants.Viewers unfamiliar with his work, however, are bound to be impressed. Organized by the museum's director, Terrie Sultan, the exhibition presents 19 works from the early 1980s to 2014. The biggest, ""Engadin I"" (1995), is a nearly 12-foot-wide picture of a white-capped mountain in Switzerland with the tiny figures of hundreds of cross-country skiers skimming a field of snow in the foreground.The most powerful works pick out socially and politically fraught subjects. ""Greeley"" (2002) is a hellish, bird's-eye view of cattle in muddy stockyards in Colorado. Mr. Gursky's images usually have a clever formal aspect, too, as in an aerial view of a Grand Prix racetrack in Bahrain from 2005, wherein the black, serpentine bands of the pavement stand out like gestural lines in an abstract painting.The spectacular, 8-foot-by-11-foot ""Katar (Qatar)"" (2012) depicts a vast gleaming interior paneled in gold-hued metal whose size dwarfs a lone worker under a semitransparent plastic tent in a far corner. It looks like a science-fiction movie set but is in fact a gas tank on a transport ship in the Persian Gulf.More puzzling are the show's most recent works, each of which feature a cinematic superhero. In ""SH I"" (2013), Iron Man in full costume and a young woman canoodle under palm trees by a peaceful sea. In ""SH II (Diptych)"" (2014), a two-part piece measuring more than 10 feet by 12 feet over all, Superman sits thinking in an otherworldly landscape under a full moon. These are ridiculous and not in a good way.It gives pause that the show's hardcover catalog was co-published by the Parrish and Gagosian Gallery, which represents Mr. Gursky. According to Ms. Sultan's acknowledgments in the catalog, Gagosian also was among those who ""generously supported this effort."" This is unsettling if you value the intellectual independence of public museums. Clearly, for Gagosian, it's a good opportunity to attract clients from among the wealthier denizens of the East End.Also at the Parrish are two sculptural works by Tara Donovan as part of the museum's ""Platform"" series, which invites artists to respond to the museum setting. Ms. Donovan is known for assembling myriad ordinary objects like plastic straws and drinking cups into optically captivating installations. Here she uses the spiral spring toy known as the Slinky. On two adjacent walls in the museum's atrium she has flattened scores of them into a mural-scale composition that looks like meandering tracks left by a giant, primordial snail. In one of the museum's smaller galleries, Ms. Donovan has installed a fully three-dimensional piece suggesting an explosion in a Slinky factory.Opening this weekend at Guild Hall is a summery show of works by Roy Lichtenstein. ""Between Sea and Sky"" will present more than 30 pieces from the 1960s to the 1990s in which that eminently inventive Pop artist played with seascape conventions in a variety of materials and styles. And guess what? The exhibition's principal sponsor is Larry Gagosian, who represents Lichtenstein's work. (An exhibition of the artist's 1983 work ""Greene Street Mural"" opens at Mr. Gagosian's West 24th Street gallery in Chelsea on Sept. 10.)Intimate Views and Wide PerspectivesThree art shows beckon visitors to the East End of Long Island.""ELAINE DE KOONING PORTRAYED"" continues through Oct. 31 at the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center, 830 Springs-Fireplace Road, East Hampton; 631-324-4929, pkhouse.org.""ANDREAS GURSKY: LANDSCAPES"" runs through Oct. 18 at the Parrish Art Museum, 279 Montauk Highway, Water Mill; 631-283-2118, parrishart.org.""ROY LICHTENSTEIN: BETWEEN SEA AND SKY"" with lesser-known land and seascapes from the 1960s to the '90s, opens on Saturday and runs through Oct. 8 at Guild Hall, 158 Main Street, East Hampton; 631-324-0806, guildhall.org.",0.0
Directors Guild Gives Prize to Iñárritu:   [Brief ],,"The Directors Guild of America on Saturday gave its top prize to Alejandro G.

Coming of Age at Full Blast:   [Review ],,"Minnie Goetze, the 15-year-old heroine of ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl,"" is a would-be cartoonist who, despite her first name, is closer in lusty spirit and scratchy pen to Robert Crumb than to Walt Disney. When, partway through this gutsy, exhilarating movie, she draws her first cartoon, it's of a bodacious female colossus striding across San Francisco. As this inky giant keeps on trucking, she evokes the 50-foot-woman of cult film fame, if one that has received a Crumb makeover, with thighs as mighty as giant sequoias and a bottom that rolls like a ship in a storm.The terrific actress Bel Powley was in her early 20s when ""Diary"" was shot, but looks more like a teenager than most of the generically buffed and prettified adolescents who populate American screens. She has the wide-open look children have before life gets in the way. But she's on the short side and is dwarfed by Kristen Wiig (great), who plays Charlotte, Minnie's boozy, inattentive mother. Ms. Powley looks almost doll-like, Lilliputian, when staring up at Alexander Skarsgard (a perfect worm), who plays Monroe, a mustachioed loafer with pitiful self-improvement plans. He's Charlotte's boyfriend when the movie opens, and he's also sleeping with the very willing, all-too-eager Minnie, although calling him her lover doesn't seem quite right -- but neither does predator.What you call Monroe, other than an expletive, depends on what you call a man having sex with a 15-year-old girl. ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" takes place in 1976, when the age of consent in California was 18 (it still is), but it unfolds in an anything-goes milieu in which Monroe might be branded more of an opportunist than a creep. Drinks and pot smoke flow through its rooms, in between snorts of cocaine. Charlotte works as a librarian and parties like, well, someone with no children, having apparently traded in Dr. Spock for Dr. Feelgood. In her hedonism, if mostly in her egotism (it's all about her), Charlotte comes off like a case study for ""The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations,"" Christopher Lasch's 1979 era-defining classic.The writer-director Marielle Heller doesn't judge the partying; she leaves that to her viewers, assuming that they come to this movie with their own ideas on the subject. She knows you can fill in all kinds of blanks, including the explicit details of Minnie and Monroe's encounters. Her discretion is a commercially expedient choice, of course; Ms. Heller wants to turn you on rather than off. But she also wants to be true to Minnie. Given this, it's important that the one time you see Minnie fully naked is when she's alone with her body and thoughts in her bedroom, gazing into a mirror. She may be the object of Monroe's lust (and he is unambiguously hers), but Ms. Heller ensures that Minnie -- who's never lighted or framed for the viewer's erotic contemplation -- isn't ours.Using a sharp scalpel, Ms. Heller extracted the story from Phoebe Gloeckner's trippy, autobiographically informed novel of the same title. Both versions of the story follow Minnie as she rides out adolescence, which goes very dark in Ms. Gloeckner's novel. Ms. Heller plays down or elides its more harrowing episodes (rape, hard drugs) and sweetens the overarching narrative by emphasizing its comic absurdity. She also embellishes the movie with cartoon hearts and flowers that wouldn't be out of place in Disney's ""Snow White."" Truer to the novel's spirit, she brings in (via the animator Sara Gunnarsdottir) an illustrated version of Aline Kominsky-Crumb, a.k.a. Mrs. Crumb, a feminist cartoonist who pops into the picture and functions as part imaginary friend, part groovy fairy godmother.Aline shows up just when Minnie needs her, materializing on a street and parked in a diner booth. Charlotte is at once present and not, and few other adults are of any help to Minnie, including her mother's former squeeze, Pascal (Christopher Meloni). Not that Minnie, who keeps her own counsel, no matter how unwise, would pay attention. As the title announces, the movie isn't about the arguments of lawyers, judges or any other guardians of the moral galaxy, any more than it's about questionable child rearing, predatory men and regrettable girlfriends. It is the diary of a specific, complex, sometimes muddled teenager who owns her story, her life and her pleasure, from the moment she says, ""I had sex today,"" to her rueful, hopeful closing declaration of self.That wee self is by turns a joy and a heartbreaker, and often an affectingly honest hormone bomb waiting to explode. Minnie looks together when you first meet her, sailing through a city park with a Cheshire cat smile, her saucer eyes bugging as she takes in the local color (facial hair and liberated, jauntily bouncing breasts) that starts to set the freewheeling, at times freaky, San Francisco scene. Once back in her bedroom -- where a large poster of a bare-chested Iggy Pop watches over her, next to a photo of Janis Joplin -- Minnie begins making audiotapes, using a recorder as a diary into which she can pour her desires, dreams, fears and thrillingly dirty secrets.It would be easy to call Minnie a victim, and Monroe the villain, even if that's not at all how it plays out in the movie. Monroe may not be exactly the light of Minnie's life, but for much of the story, he is the fire of her loins, to borrow and bend some opening words from Nabokov's ""Lolita."" In the preface to a later edition of her novel, Ms. Gloeckner writes that, in many ways, it is about her, but that it's also about the reader. ""Although I am the source of Minnie, she cannot be me -- for the book to have real meaning, she must be all girls, anyone."" It's a familiar universal appeal and also insistently political. The novel is life-specific, but what makes Minnie -- on the page and now on the screen -- greater than any one girl is how she tells her own story in her own soaringly alive voice.""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) The movie has sex scenes between a minor and an adult, as well as drug and alcohol use, seen through a girl's eyes.The Diary of a Teenage GirlOpens on FridayWritten and directed by Marielle Heller, based on the book by Phoebe Gloeckner; director of photography, Brandon Trost; edited by Marie-Hélène Dozo and Koen Timmerman; music by Nate Heller; production design by Jonah Markowitz; produced by Anne Carey, Bert Hamelinck, Madeline Samit and Miranda Bailey; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

Independent Monitor to Evaluate Chicago Police Stops:   [National Desk ],,"CHICAGO -- Under an agreement with the American Civil Liberties Union, the Chicago Police Department will allow independent evaluations of its stop-and-frisk procedures that critics say target blacks.The agreement, which was announced Friday, calls for increased public disclosure and more officer training. It follows a scathing report in March from the A.C.L.U. of Illinois that found Chicago officers disproportionately targeted blacks and other racial minorities in hundreds of thousands of stop, question and frisk encounters.Under the agreement, a former federal magistrate judge, Arlander Keys, will provide public reports twice a year on Chicago police investigatory stops and pat downs, looking at whether the city is meeting its legal requirements. The agreement goes into effect immediately.""It's not going to be a change in the actual way that we stop people, it's going to be a change in the way that we record the stop,"" the police superintendent, Garry McCarthy, said at a Friday news conference. And he suggested that the evaluations would bear out his belief that the stops had been constitutional.Mr. McCarthy also said that he was pleased his department was not compelled to take action by a court order and that he hoped the agreement would set the standard for other police departments.The president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association said other departments would be wise to follow Chicago's lead.""If we can address the community concerns without having to go to court, without a lawsuit, I think that's obviously a better way and certainly better for the relationship between the police and the community,"" said Tom Manger, chief of police in Montgomery County, Md., who was in Chicago to meet with Mr. McCarthy and other police chiefs.The only concern Mr. McCarthy said he had was that the extra paperwork might take officers off the streets for too long.In its report, the A.C.L.U. of Illinois identified more than 250,000 Chicago stop-and-frisk encounters in which there were no arrests from May through August 2014. African-Americans accounted for nearly three-quarters of those stopped, even though they make up about a third of the city's population.The agreement comes after months of negotiations between the city, the department and the A.C.L.U. that aimed to avoid expensive and time-consuming litigation, the parties said.The police department still faces a federal class-action lawsuit with 53 African-American plaintiffs claiming the street stops had led to constitutional abuses, including unlawful searches and seizures as well as excessive force.""I certainly think that it does add a lot of credibility to the lawsuit,"" said Antonio Romanucci, a lawyer handling the lawsuit.The city and department have agreed to collect additional data about investigatory stops. That will include officers' names and badge numbers, the race, ethnicity and gender of the people stopped, the reason for the stops, whether the people were frisked and other details.That information will be given to the A.C.L.U. and Mr. Keys, who will oversee the agreement's implementation.Mr. McCarthy has been a proponent of stop-and-frisk and worked at two police departments that came under fire for their use of the tactic -- the New York City Police Department and the Newark Police Department in New Jersey, which he headed before coming to Chicago.In New York, a monitor is overseeing changes to the stop-and-frisk policy after a federal judge ruled that the tactic sometimes discriminated against minorities. Last August, the city dropped appeals after Mayor Bill de Blasio -- who was elected, in part, on a campaign opposing stop-and-frisk -- took office.And the Newark department was placed under a federal monitor after the Justice Department found that when Mr. McCarthy ran it, 75 percent of pedestrian stops were made without constitutionally adequate reasons.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",0.0
Ebola Challenges a Hands-On Tool:   [Science Desk ],,"Doctors treating Ebola patients while wearing ""the full spacesuit"" -- protective gear, including waterproof hoods -- are struggling with a clinician's dilemma: what to do if they can't use one of the oldest, most basic tools in medicine -- a stethoscope.It's not safe to cut holes in the hood, and nothing that might be contaminated should touch bare skin or the delicate ear canals.Also, nothing that touches an infected patient should touch another or leave the ward. As a result, said Dr. Robert A. Fowler, a Canadian critical care specialist who helped write the World Health Organization treatment guidelines, ""it's quite uncommon that you see a stethoscope on an Ebola ward in Africa.""Although cases are dropping rapidly in Africa, experts said stethoscopes could become more important as the remaining patients receive lifesaving intravenous hydration. A stethoscope can detect the sound of fluid in the lungs -- the same ""wet, crackling"" sound caused by pneumonia -- that indicates a patient has been on the IV drip too long.In American hospitals treating Ebola patients, doctors have used expensive electronic stethoscopes.A $500 version from Thinklabs, a Colorado-based company, was used on Ebola patients at New York's Bellevue Hospital Center and at University of Nebraska Medical Center. The hollow tubes are replaced by disposable earbuds that fit under the waterproof hood. The wire runs out the sleeve and plugs into a rechargeable, diaphragm-equipped microphone that acts as the bell. That microphone stays in the patient's room, and the earbuds are thrown out. The microphone can also be plugged into speakers or into a cellphone for transmission.""It's a cool gadget,"" said Dr. Laura Evans, the lead doctor in the care of Dr. Craig Spencer at Bellevue in the fall. ""It looks like a hockey puck, but you get a nice, loud sound quality -- much better than the disposable stethoscopes we tried.""Before cases in Africa began dropping, Dr. Armand Sprecher, an Ebola expert for Doctors Without Borders, said his agency was considering field-testing a $400 3M electronic stethoscope and would be willing to consider the Thinklabs model.Kyle Hall, the telehealth coordinator for Nebraska Medicine, which oversees the hospital that successfully treated two Ebola patients, said doctors there had tried both and preferred the Thinklabs model because it used no hollow tubes and directed the sound via wire, rather than Bluetooth, which can be blocked.Several doctors working in Africa described stethoscopes as helpful but not indispensable there. Heart and lung ailments are not among the typical initial Ebola symptoms, which usually include fever, aches, vomiting and diarrhea. However, later symptoms can include heart failure from potassium loss and bleeding into the lungs.Also, in the absence of electronic monitors, a stethoscope can help determine whether a patient is comatose or actually dead.Doctors Without Borders once used light surgical head covers. ""With those,"" Dr. Sprecher said, ""you could sort of cram the earpieces in your ears and use them -- in an unsatisfactory way.""Now that thick hoods that fluids cannot penetrate are mandatory, the agency uses other ""workarounds"" that ""hard-core clinicians who fetishize the bedside exam"" would reject, Dr. Sprecher said, but were useful under crisis conditions.For example, they used only half of a blood-pressure reading, the systolic pressure -- the 120 in a 120/80 reading, for example. That can be taken by inflating a blood pressure cuff on an arm and feeling with a finger at what pressure the pulse below it restarts. (Getting the diastolic pressure requires a stethoscope to hear the thumping of the blood disappear as the cuff's pressure ends completely.)The top number ""isn't a complete picture, but it's pretty good,"" he said. ""If it starts dropping, you start to worry.""The agency is testing battery-powered cuffs that obtain both numbers, but it is still unclear if they can survive chlorine spray.Another workaround involves the body's reaction to the loss of fluids and electrolytes. Patients' hearts may speed up and become irregular, and patients may hyperventilate, unconsciously trying to blow off carbon dioxide as their bodies become more acidic. A stethoscope makes diagnosis easier, but it can be done by taking pulses and counting breaths.""If they are huffing and puffing, they're very sick,"" Dr. Sprecher said.A stethoscope is also useful for hearing bowel sounds, he added, ""but when diarrhea is pouring out, you don't need a stethoscope to know the patient's bowel is working overtime.""Dr. Pranav Shetty, emergency health coordinator for the International Medical Corps, said his doctors avoided stethoscopes for safety and used similar workarounds, along with measures like urine output. But with more patients on IV drips, stethoscopes could help detect those being hydrated too much.Also, Dr. Fowler of the W.H.O. noted, many Africans have had untreated infections, such as ear infections, that scar the heart valves. Leaky valves also cause fluid backup in the lungs, and stethoscopes can distinguish between the two causes.Portable X-ray machines and ultrasound scanners could also do it, he said, but they are rare in Ebola wards and difficult to sterilize.Clive Smith, the inventor of the Thinklabs stethoscope, said that his device could be used even in crowded Ebola wards. Although chlorine spray would destroy its circuitry, he said, the bell could be wiped with alcohol or bleach pads.Alternatively, he said, some American hospitals now put an ""ultrasound condom"" on the diaphragm between patients, and in a pinch, a clean surgical glove or a sandwich bag could serve the same purpose.Photograph (Photograph by Eric Francis for the New York Times)",0.0
Dry Days Bring Ferocious Start to Fire Season:   [News; Series ],,"WALLA WALLA, Wash. -- Another summer of record-breaking drought and heat has seized the West, setting off costly and destructive wildfires from Southern California, where a single blaze burned more than 30,000 acres of national forest east of Los Angeles, to Montana, where a fast-moving fire in Glacier National Park recently forced tourists to flee hotels, campgrounds and vehicles.No measurable rain has fallen here in Walla Walla since May. Temperatures have broken decades-old records. And, though known for soaking skies and cool summers, Washington State is well on track to surpass last year's wildfire season, its busiest on record.Dozens of homes and thousands of acres have burned over the past few months -- in the rain forests of the Olympic Peninsula, in suburban communities on the edge of the wild lands, and in this city of wheat farms and vineyards where hundreds of firefighters are still battling a blaze on the western slopes of the Blue Mountains, digging and scraping the earth, building barriers of dirt to shield the dried-out forests from the approaching flames.""Our fire season started a month ahead, our crops matured weeks ahead and the dry weather we usually get in August, we've had since May,"" said Peter J. Goldmark, Washington's commissioner of public lands. Walking along the edge of the Blue Creek fire, burning near the Oregon-Washington border, he added, ""By heavens, if this isn't a sign of climate change, then what is climate change going to bring?""The entire region is under duress. It has been so dry for so long that federal officials have warned about the potential for more catastrophe in the months ahead, as drought and climate change push high temperatures higher, drying already-arid lands.The conditions vary from one area to the next: an unforgiving drought in California, where a fire captain died Thursday night while battling one of 23 wildfires burning in the northern part of the state; snow that arrived late and melted early in Idaho; extreme temperature swings in the Southwest; and grass that has turned to tinder across the Pacific Northwest.But the West's stubborn drought seems to be especially devastating the farther north it reaches. In Alaska, 399 fires burned in June. That was nearly double the number seen in the same month in 2004 -- considered to have been the state's worst fire year on record.In the past, the fires mostly burned tundra. This year, though, several have merged and marched toward cities and small fishing villages, destroying, damaging or threatening hundreds of homes.It is all part of an extensive nationwide scorching. About 63,312 wildfires destroyed 3.6 million acres of land across the country last year, at a cost of $1.52 billion to fight the fires.Early projections have placed this year's cost even higher, at up to $2.1 billion, well beyond the $1.5 billion set aside by the federal Interior and Agriculture Departments, which administer more than 600 million acres of public lands.The Obama administration has asked Congress to place wildfires in the same category as hurricanes and floods, with a dedicated disaster fund to pay for their suppression. Federal agencies have been forced for years to pay for firefighting with money that had been set aside for preventive programs to minimize the long-term risk of those wildfires, compounding the problem of frequent fires.The Republican leadership in Congress has yet to endorse any of the proposals.""These are emergencies,"" Interior Secretary Sally Jewell told reporters recently, as she urged Congress to act. ""They should be treated as such.""Rain and HeatIn Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona earlier this summer, Doug Sprouse and three other firefighters picked up clumps of grass from the ground, sawed off pieces from fallen branches and pulled bright leaves from oak trees -- ""fuels,"" in their vernacular, the stuff that feeds and carries fire across the land.A drizzle was all it had taken to enliven the high desert's foliage and tinge the woods in rich shades of green. But with months of negligible snowfall behind and the temperatures climbing, Mr. Sprouse, an engine captain with the National Park Service, knew it would not take long until the foliage became tinder.The finer the fuel, the faster it loses the water it holds inside -- and when it is dry, it is like kindling in a campfire.He looked around, seizing on subtle signs of want on the big trees, like the yellowed tips on the needles of thirsty Ponderosa pines. ""When it comes to moisture,"" he said, ""these woods have been running on red for a really long time.""Between 2005 and 2014, the average number of fires that burned more than 100,000 acres -- known as ""megafires"" -- increased to 9.8 per year, up from fewer than one a year before 1995, according to statistics compiled by the National Interagency Fire Center, a multiagency logistical hub in Boise, Idaho.One reason, ecologists and historians say, is the well-established link between big fires and the steady loss of moisture in forests from higher temperatures brought on by climate change.Even when it rains, as it did in Arizona this spring, there is no guarantee it will be enough. Rain needs to be sustained over long periods to end the drought affecting the West, experts say, and rising temperatures continue to increase the risk from flames.According to findings by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 10 of the warmest years on record have occurred since 1998. Already, 2015 is challenging 2014 for the No. 1 spot on that list.""It's like a bank account you can't balance,"" said A. Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in Palisades, N.Y., who has studied the effects of climate change in living organisms. ""You deposit moisture, but so much of it is withdrawn through heat and evaporation there just isn't enough to meet the demand.""Scientists have spoken of ""climatological extremes"" as the new normal, a trend underlined by this year's El Niño pattern, which brought extraordinary rainfall to the Southwest, causing deadly floods in Texas while wiping out short-term drought conditions in eastern New Mexico.Alaska had a lot of rain, too, just at the wrong time: It fell in March, melting its anemic snowpack two months earlier than usual. Mushy snow on the trails forced organizers to move the starting line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race 220 miles north to Fairbanks, where the temperature reached 86 on May 23: 3 degrees warmer than in Phoenix.Canada, with an unprecedented 5,548 fires and 9.1 million acres burned as of July 23, registered record temperatures in May and June, Earth's warmest such month on record, according to NASA and several other climate reporting organizations.In Oregon, another state normally known for cool and wet conditions, Gov. Katherine Brown recently declared drought emergencies in three counties. There are now 23 Oregon counties with such emergencies, more than double last year's tally.""The extreme drought conditions we are experiencing reflect a new reality for Oregon,"" she said in a statement.The Arid NorthwestAll across the Northwest, patches of earth are thirsty. The vegetation is extremely dry, often yellow and brittle, a condition fueled by the same warmer, drier patterns that are contributing to worsening drought and longer fire seasons around the world.But the West is also facing the consequences of a decades-old policy of extinguishing every fire as fast as possible, often the morning after it sparks, essentially undercutting fire's natural role as janitor of the wild lands.The accelerating pace of development in the wild has added another dimension to the challenge. A recent report by Verisk Analytics, a risk assessment firm, showed that 4.5 million homes in 13 Western states were at high or extreme risk of being damaged or destroyed by wildfire.In Wenatchee, Wash., a recent firestorm turned a neighborhood to ash, ravaging 24 homes as it barreled through.In Walla Walla, residents worried about the Blue Creek fire's march toward their homes and crops.""I've lost 1,000 acres to the fire,"" said Mark Klicker, whose family harvests timber in the area. ""It really is gut-wrenching, kinda like you ate the wrong food. You feel helpless.""Jonathan B. Jarvis, director of the National Park Service, said the agency had been working to adapt to this new reality of wild variations in climate and larger, more intense blazes, which have already begun to alter the composition of some landscapes.One of the most extreme examples is the Bandelier National Monument, near Los Alamos, N.M., where two fires, in 2000 and 2011, sterilized the ground, leaving huge patches of forest entirely denuded, including one measuring about 30,000 acres.He acknowledged the proven benefits of fire: Ashes fertilize soil, and burned logs create habitats for wildlife. But he also warned about the devastation from fires that are just too intense.""We're concerned about our children's ability to experience these places like we have,"" Mr. Jarvis said.One way to help, he said, is to make fire an ally. In national parks and forests across the nation, firefighters are using ""prescribed"" burns -- in which some lightning-sparked blazes are allowed to burn within specific areas -- to clear dried grass and brush.On the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, fire managers use the fuel samples gathered by Mr. Sprouse and his crew every week from March through November to decide when -- or if -- it is safe to use flames from controlled burns this way, as a giant broom.On a cool day in June, when a thick layer of clouds blanketed the skies, they placed the samples in plastic containers roughly the size of baby food jars and labeled them according to how long it takes for each to soak up and lose moisture.In the office, where the fuels were measured for water content, Dan Pearson, fire management officer for the park's South District, explained that the trees are stressed because of the progressive loss of moisture they have endured for 10 years.Mr. Pearson, who runs the fire and aviation programs on his side of the park, explained that his job ""isn't to figure out why the environment is changing."" Rather, it is to make the best possible decision in a changing environment.But here in Washington during the Blue Creek fire, which has burned more than 6,000 acres since it started on July 20, Mr. Goldmark turned his attention to another, more immediate and complicating factor: meteorologists' predictions of the El Niño pattern lasting into the spring.Typically, it means cooler temperatures for the desert Southwest and warmer, drier weather for much of the Pacific Northwest and Northern Plains -- a dangerous prospect.""All of these trees, even though they look green, they're all pretty dry,"" Mr. Goldmark said, pointing at the firs and spruces that lined the burning mountainsides. ""If this full-blown El Niño pans out, we should all be worried about what the next fire season is going to be like.""Photograph The Rocky Fire in Lake County, Calif., Broke Out Wednesday and Spread to 8,000 Acres.

Jays Acquire Optimism in Flurry of Transactions:   [Sports Desk ],,"TORONTO -- Paul Molitor rounded the bases just ahead of Joe Carter on that electrifying night of Oct. 23, 1993. He felt the roar that pulsated inside the Skydome when he scored the winning run on Carter's homer, giving the Toronto Blue Jays their second consecutive World Series title.It remains the last postseason play in Blue Jays history.Nearly 22 years later, Molitor was back in Toronto this week as the manager of the Minnesota Twins. On Monday he was reminded of that exciting time long ago, as more than 45,000 people filtered into the seats of the same stadium and threw their vocal support behind David Price, one of several new Blue Jays players who those fans hope will finally get Canada's team back into the postseason.""I've seen and heard it before here when it's like that,"" Molitor said the next day as his team stretched before batting practice. ""This sounded to me like there was more hunger to it. There was some real urgency there.""When the Kansas City Royals reached the World Series last year, they wiped clean their account as the team with the longest absence from the playoffs, not having been there since they won it all in 1985.Now the onus is on the Blue Jays, who are acting as if they want to hand that baton of futility to someone else. General Manager Alex Anthopoulos made a dizzying series of trades right before the July 31 nonwaiver deadline to enhance the roster, hauling in a trove of talent that was the envy of 29 other teams.Anthopoulos and the Blue Jays have made bold moves before, but there is a universal sense that this time is different. He acquired Troy Tulowitzki -- to some the best shortstop in baseball -- from the Rockies. He pried Price -- considered the best pitcher available -- from the Tigers. Anthopoulos also grabbed outfielder Ben Revere from the Phillies and the relief pitchers Mark Lowe, dealt by the Mariners, and LaTroy Hawkins, who came with Tulowitzki from Colorado.Almost overnight, a team that needed significant upgrades, particularly an ace pitcher, had virtually everything required to quench its postseason thirst.""Alex's moves have given the team a jolt, and it gave the fans a jolt,"" Manager John Gibbons said. ""Now's the tough part. Now, you've got to go out and win.""So far, the Jays have. At the time of the Tulowitzki deal, which had been brewing since last off-season, the Blue Jays were underachievers. Their record was 50-50, seven games behind the Yankees in the American League East despite having the best run differential (118 after Thursday's win).But after Tulowitzki put on the uniform July 29, homering in his Jays debut, Toronto won eight of its next nine games to move into the second A.L. wild-card spot. The Blue Jays are also four and a half games behind the Yankees, the team Toronto will visit this weekend in the Bronx.As well as the Yankees are playing this season, confidence is surging in Toronto and across Canada, especially because this weekend's games are the first of 13 left between the teams, providing ample opportunities for the Blue Jays to whittle away the deficit.""I'd like to say,"" outfielder Jose Bautista said, ""that the inclination for me to feel optimistic about our chances, with our additions and some of the stuff that's going on over there with injuries and lack of performances, that if I was a betting man, I would bet on us.""Bautista, who hit a thundering grand slam against the Twins on Wednesday, is still at the core of a lineup that is stacked with right-handed power. Even before the trades, Toronto had scored more runs than any other team, and its on-base plus slugging percentage was the highest in the majors.But now Tulowitzki is leading off. Third baseman Josh Donaldson, who was brought over from the Oakland Athletics in an off-season trade, bats second and is the Jays' hottest hitter, with five home runs in his last seven games. He had 29 home runs and 29 doubles after Thursday's series finale with the Twins, which the Blue Jays won, 9-3.Edwin Encarnacion is also a threat in the middle of the lineup, and catcher Russell Martin, another big off-season acquisition, mostly bats sixth. Bautista said that when he looks around the clubhouse now, he is struck by how many good players he sees. Even those who have played in a World Series, like Tulowitzki in 2007, agree.""I've played with good players before,"" Tulowitzki said, ""but not this many.""Pitching was the real need. Toronto's starting pitchers' earned run average is 3.93, tied for 16th-best in baseball. Adding Price allows everyone else to slot into more fitting roles in the rotation.""When Price is on the mound, that's the best team in baseball,"" said Twins pitcher Mike Pelfrey, who did not figure in the four-game series here.Price, who tossed eight superb innings in his debut Monday, is scheduled to pitch Saturday at Yankee Stadium, where he has a career 6-2 record and a 3.52 E.R.A. Tulowitzki will also make his first appearance there since last year when he showed up as a fan after visiting a doctor in New York. The visit fueled speculation that he wanted to be traded to the Yankees to replace Derek Jeter.""I just went to watch my favorite player, my idol growing up,"" Tulowitzki said of Jeter. ""People thought I was going there for different reasons, and that wasn't the case. It was an opportunity to watch Derek play one last time and see how he goes about his business. It was just a way to make myself a better player, really.""Instead of taking over for Jeter, Tulowitzki ended up replacing Jose Reyes, a former Mets shortstop, who was sent to the Rockies in the deal.Many of Anthopoulos's previous moves did not produce their desired results. In November 2012, he engineered a blockbuster trade that brought Reyes, Josh Johnson and Mark Buehrle from the Marlins. A month later, he got R. A. Dickey from the Mets in a deal for Noah Syndergaard and Travis d'Arnaud.The Blue Jays missed the playoffs.Now Anthopoulos is in the final year of his contract, and Paul Beeston, the team president, is stepping down at the end of the season. Last off-season, the Jays went after Dan Duquette, the general manager of the Baltimore Orioles, and they are also said to covet Dave Dombrowski, who was recently let go by the Tigers.That kind of speculation could lead a general manager to make precipitous moves to save his job. But Anthopoulos, who gave up many prospects in last month's deals, has not abandoned the future: He did not trade pitcher Marcus Stroman, a top prospect, in the off-season, and he recently spent $4 million to sign the 16-year-old Vladimir Guerrero Jr., using money that could have gone toward the current team.Asked about mortgaging the team's future, Anthopoulos said: ""I never operate that way. I just don't believe in it. I had so many opportunities to move players that could impact us long-term, and I didn't. We didn't like those deals. These deals we liked.""A year ago at the deadline, Anthopoulos was criticized for not making trades to help the flagging team, but executives on other teams said the Jays did not have the payroll flexibility to do so. This year, Anthopoulos set aside money in the off-season for July 31, enabling him to add Price, Tulowitzki and a ton of optimism.""Last year at this time, we as players felt we were on the descent,"" Dickey said. ""You could feel it. It was palpable. This year it's the antithesis of that. We feel like we're on the ascent.""Photograph Above, David Price Walked Off to a Standing Ovation After His Blue Jays Debut On Monday.

"Cuomo, Seeking to Save 2 Nuclear Plants, Will Order Increase in Clean Energy:   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"Frustrated by the pending shutdown of two nuclear power plants on Lake Ontario, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo plans to order state regulators to mandate that, by 2030, half of all power consumed by New Yorkers be generated from renewable sources that emit much less carbon dioxide, people briefed on the matter said.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has already declared a goal of having 50 percent of the state's power come from solar, wind, hydroelectric or other renewable sources in 15 years, but the state has had no means of enforcing that directive. The governor intends to have the Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities in the state, codify the requirement, these people said. Some of them, including a Cuomo administration official, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to discuss the proposed mandate.The mandate would be another step toward the governor's goal of a 40 percent reduction in carbon emissions from plants supplying the state's electricity. In the intervening years, the energy policy would give utilities an incentive to use power generated by nuclear plants, which are considered clean sources, though not renewable.By pushing utilities to obtain more of the power they distribute from less-polluting sources, state officials hope to delay the planned shutdown of two nuclear power plants on the shore of Lake Ontario. Aides to the governor have been trying for several weeks to dissuade Entergy from closing one of them, the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant in Oswego County.Entergy officials say they will close the plant in late 2016 or early 2017 because it has been losing about $60 million a year. Nuclear plants emit less air pollution than power plants fueled by natural gas or coal, so the loss of them would set back the state's hopes of meeting its clean-energy goals.Even if the mandate comes too late to keep the reactor at the FitzPatrick plant operating, state officials hope it could prolong the life of the Robert E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant near Rochester. The Ginna plant's owners said in 2014 that they intended to shut it down, but state officials struck a deal to subsidize its operation to keep it running until 2017.Cuomo administration officials want the upstate nuclear power plants to continue operating until 2030, when they hope that there will be enough sources of renewable energy to supply half of the state's needs, according to people who have been briefed on the matter. But Mr. Cuomo has taken an opposite stance on Entergy's Indian Point nuclear plant in Westchester County, which has two reactors.The governor has repeatedly called for Indian Point to be shut down, saying it is too dangerous to have a nuclear plant so close to a metropolis. It is perched on the edge of the Hudson River in Buchanan, about 30 miles north of Manhattan.""It's certainly a quandary,"" one of the people briefed on the matter, Gavin J. Donohue, the president of the Independent Power Producers of New York, said of Mr. Cuomo's positions on the upstate and downstate nuclear plants. ""It's clear that the governor is recognizing the value of upstate nuclear energy. That's a big change for the State of New York, and it's welcome news.""Mr. Donohue said he thought owners of power plants in the state would welcome Mr. Cuomo's mandate if it did not interfere too much with the market for power. ""What we're trying to get to is a market-based approach to solving climate-change issues,"" he said. ""We need to not have the government pick winners and losers.""Mr. Cuomo, who has positioned himself as a leader in the battle against climate change, announced an energy plan in June that drew praise from former Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Gore, a Democrat who has made drawing attention to global warming his signature cause, called the governor's proposed mandate ""a terrific and bold action,"" noting that it comes a week before the United Nations will hold a conference on climate change in Paris.""Governor Cuomo's commitment to expanding renewable energy and transforming the energy landscape in New York State reflects his longstanding leadership in the effort to solve the climate crisis,"" Mr. Gore said in a statement. ""And the timing couldn't be better. As we approach the global climate negotiations in Paris in just over a week, actions by state governments like New York State provide essential momentum toward a strong and effective agreement.""Rory M. Christian, the director of clean energy for the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, said that Mr. Cuomo's proposed mandate was similar to one that California's Legislature passed and Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed into law last month.""Yeah, it's an achievable goal,"" Mr. Christian said. ""We got a man to the moon; we can get to 50 percent renewable energy.""What effect the mandate will have on consumers' electric bills is ""a concern,"" Mr. Christian said. ""Rates are always going to be a concern,"" he said. But, he added, ""the key thing is more renewables will keep those costs from going up or stabilize them.""Renewable sources of energy like solar and wind power operate intermittently and not as reliably as plants fueled by gas, coal or nuclear. And encouraging the development of those sources may involve subsidies from ratepayers, the Cuomo administration official said.On the other hand, the state official said, ""This will actually avoid the sticker shock that ratepayers experience every time there is a fuel shortage, a power plant goes offline or there is a spike in energy costs.""Photograph The Robert E.

Motorola Solutions Chooses Silver Lake to Help Fund Transition Away From Radios:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"Motorola Solutions has been the target of several prominent investors over the years, notably the activists Carl C. Icahn and ValueAct Capital.Now the company, which makes public safety communications equipment, has another big investor as its partner of choice.Motorola Solutions plans to announce on Wednesday that it has taken a $1 billion investment from the private equity firm Silver Lake.The investment -- a so-called private investment in public equity, or PIPE, in the form of debt that can be converted into common stock -- is one of the biggest Silver Lake has made in its 16-year history, rivaling the $1.4 billion in cash it contributed to the management-led buyout of Dell two years ago.In seeking out Silver Lake, a specialist in technology deals that oversees $26 billion worth of assets, Motorola Solutions is hoping to accelerate a transition from selling only radios that police officers, fire departments and other emergency workers use, to a broader emergency communications platform.As Greg Brown, the company's chief executive, put it in a telephone interview, the aim is to provide all the information that is ""tactically useful"" to workers in an emergency situation.That means adding more complex software and other data services to Motorola Solutions' capabilities.Such a shift would be the latest in the company's recent evolution. Under pressure from Mr. Icahn, the billionaire investor, the company spun off its cellphone business in 2008 and focused on government and public safety customers.Soon after jettisoning the cellphone business, the company took on another activist, the hedge fund ValueAct Capital, which still has a representative on the board and owns a roughly 8 percent stake.Motorola Solutions has sold off a number of other operations over the years, including a corporate network division and an enterprise services unit.Since becoming a stand-alone operation, Motorola Solutions has grappled with ways to revive its business. Sales have stayed largely flat since 2011. The company had explored selling itself, but called off the process after finding no acceptable bids.Mr. Brown and his team have focused in recent years both on developing a platform for government worker communications and on cutting costs. They have slashed about $550 million in operating expenses over the last three years and have laid off about 35 percent of the company's work force since spinning off the handset business.""The shine is really starting to show,"" Mr. Brown said. ""I think this is an exciting inflection point for opportunity.""Shares of Motorola Solutions, whose market value as of Tuesday's close was about $12.6 billion, have risen 96 percent over the last five years.That combination of business prospects and moves toward efficiency helped draw in Silver Lake. And for Motorola Solutions, the investment firm's specialty in technology and supporting financial maneuvers like consolidation made it a natural choice.One of Silver Lake's previous investments was in Avago Technologies, a chip maker that the firm helped create and then invested in further. That helped pave the way for Avago to buy a rival, Broadcom, last spring, generating a huge paper profit for the investment shop.""What I liked in the engagement with the team at Silver Lake was their technology expertise, which I view as an accelerant and extension of our own efforts,"" Mr. Brown said.Executives from Motorola Solutions and Silver Lake began quietly negotiating several months ago, in each company's corporate offices and sometimes in more intimate environs. One meeting took place in May at the Bay Area home of Egon Durban, a Silver Lake managing partner, where Mr. Brown and his team half-jokingly insisted that a Chicago Bulls playoff game be on the television.As part of the deal, two top Silver Lake executives -- Mr. Durban and Greg Mondre -- will join Motorola Solutions' board.""Motorola Solutions is an iconic company and the global market leader in public safety technology,"" Mr. Durban and Mr. Mondre said in a statement. ""We believe it is creating a new era in data-rich public safety communications and has significant potential for growth. Its core business is unrivaled in the United States and around the world, with a broad and loyal customer base, an outstanding record of reliability and growing reach and scale driven by technology innovation.""The transaction is expected to close on Aug. 25.",0.0
Family Values:   [Style Desk ],,"LOS ANGELES -- The filmmaking brothers Paul and Chris Weitz, who have had their movie hits and misses since breaking through with the blockbuster 1999 teen sex comedy ""American Pie,"" had childhoods that resemble something out of a movie made by their friend Wes Anderson.The writer Tom Wolfe was a guest at the family dinner table. The Swedish auteur Ingmar Bergman once took them to the circus. And they spent many boyhood hours orchestrating elaborate skits with their collection of stuffed animals (which included twin alligators and a duck made of socks), who sipped cocktails and had turf wars at a make-believe club fashioned after the El Morocco, a once glamorous nightspot near the Weitz family's Park Avenue apartment.The brothers described their unusual provenance during an interview at the office they share in the Venice section of Los Angeles, not far from where they live with their wives and children.""I was four years older, and Chris was certainly his own person,"" said Paul, 49, who has tousled gray hair. ""But we were close.""Chris, 45, has a scholarly Clark Kent demeanor. ""We were a resistance unit,"" he said, laughing.""Essentially, we had a provincial upbringing in the middle of a huge city,"" Paul said.Their father, the clothing designer John Weitz, who left Nazi Germany as a teenager, made a grand living in fashion and went on to write novels and biographies of men in Hitler's inner circle.""Wes told me once he used to have a John Weitz blazer that somehow made its way onto Jason Schwartzman's character in 'Rushmore,' "" said Paul, referring to the oddball protagonist of Mr. Anderson's 1998 film.The mother of the Weitz brothers, Susan Kohner, was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in Douglas Sirk's 1959 film ""Imitation of Life."" She retired from show business when she settled down with Mr. Weitz, and often traveled with her sons to their grandparents' house in Los Angeles, where Chris and Paul roasted marshmallows by the patio fireplace in the company of ""actors with European accents,"" as Chris put it, like Yul Brynner and Liv Ullmann.Their maternal grandfather, Paul Kohner, a Czech émigré, was a talent agent who represented Greta Garbo and Billy Wilder; their maternal grandmother is the screen actress Lupita Tovar, who left Mexico in the days of the early talkies and remained close to old friends like the painter Diego Rivera.As children, Paul and Chris sometimes annoyed their old-school father with their constant performances. ""Once I remember being in London,"" Paul said, ""and Chris and me were little kids doing some shtick. We were interviewing pigeons on the street and we wouldn't stop. I remember Dad saying, 'It's so booor-ring!' It was an early piece of dramatic criticism.""Their high jinks had a choreographed flair. They pilfered sugar packets from restaurants while pretending to be spies carrying out a secret mission called Operation White Gold, and a brief period of light shoplifting hinted at their literary leanings.""We did go through a book-swiping phase,"" Chris said. ""To be fair, they were paperbacks. Anything larger wouldn't fit into our 8-year-old trouser pockets.""""I took Bruce Tegner's 'Complete Book of Self-Defense,' which taught me how to flip people over,"" Paul said.""I remember stealing a William Steig book,"" Chris said.""I don't remember that,"" Paul said, looking at his brother, puzzled. ""We lived near this bookstore called the Madison Avenue Bookshop, and a lovely man ran it.""Chris said he didn't recall stealing anything from that store.""I might have once or twice,"" Paul said. ""For all I know, he actually knew and billed our parents.""As a teenager, Paul used to doctor the grades on his report cards, turning minuses into pluses. Sometimes he wandered through the Metropolitan Museum of Art high on ""stimulants"" that he procured in Central Park, he said.Chris pursued more patrician activities. As a youth he joined Manhattan's Knickerbocker Greys, an after-school marching corps founded in 1881 ""for boys of the scions of New York upper crust families,"" as he described it. He went to a London boarding school when he was 14, but remained popular among New York's cotillion set.When it came time for the brothers to embark on a career, their Manhattan upbringing and childhood habit of creating imaginary worlds together came in handy: They were the co-writers (along with Todd Alcott) the screenplay for the 1998 animated film ""Antz,"" which was set in a place they knew well, Central Park, with a hero voiced by Woody Allen.After they directed ""American Pie"" (with Chris as an uncredited director), they wrote and directed ""About a Boy."" The screenplay was nominated for an Oscar. Then they went their separate ways as writers and directors for more than a decade.In that time, the older brother, Paul, wrote plays and directed movies, among them ""In Good Company,"" ""American Dreamz"" and ""Little Fockers."" His latest is ""Grandma,"" which comes out this month.Chris, in the meantime, wrote and directed ""The Golden Compass""; directed ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon""; and wrote two young-adult novels (including the newly published ""The New Order""), as well as the script for a ""Star Wars"" spinoff movie, ""Star Wars Anthology: Rogue One,"" which is now in production.""For me,"" Paul said, ""there is some element of joy in the erasure of self when you are working.""Chris added similar sentiments: ""There is nothing better than directing a movie that is going well.""The brothers left their Venice office in separate cars and navigated heavy traffic on the way to the Bel Air home of their grandmother, now 105. She was resting when they went inside, but their mother, who has two Golden Globe awards and an Oscar nomination, was there to greet them.""I like your haircut,"" she told Chris, sweeping a lock of hair from his forehead.He stared blankly ahead.Ms. Kohner, who was visiting from New York, went on to recall how her boys used to make fun of her performance in ""Imitation of Life."" ""They used to do the thing from 'Imitation,' the dance,"" she said. ""They did it just to annoy me.""The brothers laughed knowingly. ""Mom had this striptease in 'Imitation' where her character sings, 'The loneliest word I've ever heard is empty,' "" Paul said.The song from the movie was ""Empty Arms,"" and Paul began to sing it while Chris retreated to the kitchen.If the brothers' films have a common thread, it may be in their exploration of relationships between men, which Chris chalked up to ""daddy issues we had to deal with.""Their father was an unusually accomplished man who, during World War II (before his success as a designer and author) served in the Office of Strategic Services, a forerunner of the C.I.A. He was an affectionate presence, but he set a high bar.""He took the level of a perceived insult -- walking around with torn jeans -- to a new level,"" Paul said.Mr. Weitz also bluntly doled out fatherly wisdom. When Chris fretted over a girl who wasn't returning his calls, he said his father told him, ""If somebody doesn't call you, it's because they don't want to talk to you.""But he supported the artistic choices of his sons, even among friends who disapproved of the notorious scene in ""American Pie"" where a lusty teenager makes novel use of an apple pastry. ""Dad was out in Sag Harbor,"" Chris recalled, ""and some other older gentleman came up to him and disparagingly said, 'I bet you are very proud of your sons.' And our dad said, 'Haven't you ever masturbated before?' ""Chris and Paul looked at each other and laughed.""I don't know where the conversation went from there,"" Paul said.""There is nowhere to go,"" Chris replied, chuckling.These days, even when they're not working together, the brothers give each other advice and encouragement. ""We do look at each other's films and give each other notes,"" Paul said. ""I can remember when I was slightly on the ropes about something professionally, feeling bad about myself, and Chris wrote me a postcard. On the back it read, 'You are going to win.' It was subconsciously childish, but I really took it to heart. I kept it in my sock drawer.""Chris said, ""When you are in the middle of these movies, they tend to eat your life.""He understands this better than most, given his experience making ""The Golden Compass,"" a $180 million epic starring Nicole Kidman, based on the first novel in Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy. The movie was controversial from the start; skittish executives demanded modifications to its skeptical view of organized religion and asked for a more upbeat ending.""Those books came to me at a tremendously important time in my life,"" said Chris, whose father, an atheist of Jewish lineage, had died not long before he got to work on the script. ""To be, sort of, not delivering a good enough version was really difficult for me.""""The Golden Compass"" faltered at the domestic box office, and no sequels followed. ""In terms of career stuff, it was tough,"" Chris said, ""because everything had been coming up roses up until that point for me, for us.""Now the brothers are collaborating again, this time with Steven Spielberg, who hired them to write an adaptation of the Japanese film ""Like Father, Like Son,"" which took the Jury Prize at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.""We grew up being drilled into politeness,"" Paul said. ""It is a great tool in Hollywood and a great tool in collaboration, because 'You are an idiot' is a lot worse to hear than 'You are really wonderful, and you've done something idiotic.' ""Chris gave his brother a skeptical look. ""We don't really talk to each other that way,"" he said.""Yeah,"" Paul said, with a laugh. ""That was all metaphorical speech.""Photograph Chris Weitz, Left, and Paul Weitz in the Bel Air Section of Los Angeles, at the Home of Their Grandmother Lupita Tovar, 105, an Actress in Early Talkies.

Jets Linebacker Carries New Load as Fullback:   [Sports Desk ],,"FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- Like many players in high school, Julian Howsare started on both sides of the ball, though for college he had to choose. The coaches at Clarion University projected him as a defensive end, so that was where he played, demoralizing quarterbacks with an array of speed rushes and spin moves.Part of him yearned to play offense again -- whenever the Golden Eagles possessed the ball near the goal line, Howsare would badger the offensive coordinator, Chris Weibel, to let him run it in -- but by the end of a career studded with awards and accolades, he had begun attracting interest from some N.F.L. teams.One was the Jets, who, projecting him as an outside linebacker in their 3-4 scheme, signed him soon after the draft. Howsare's intelligence, athleticism and aggressive temperament appealed to them, and it was those attributes that prompted Coach Todd Bowles to seek him out for a conversation Sunday and pose a potentially life-altering question just before defensive meetings were about to start: How would you like to play fullback?Of course he would, Howsare said, and the transformation began at once. He hunkered down with his tablet and started studying the offensive playbook so that he would at least know where to line up. In his locker appeared a white pinnie -- the color worn by offensive players -- that he would have to slip over his green jersey. While linebackers practiced their coverage skills, he huddled with the running backs, performing agility drills and catching passes and evading tackling dummies.""It's another opportunity for me to show what I can do,"" Howsare said.As one of 90 players on a roster that must be whittled to 53 by Sept. 5, Howsare finds himself in the predicament of trying to make the team at a position he last played five years ago, as a senior at Altoona High School in Pennsylvania. As it has been explained to him, the switch is temporary but indefinite.The Jets still consider him a linebacker -- ""Make no mistake about that,"" Bowles said -- but they are intrigued enough by his prospects that he will take reps at fullback until further notice.""Sometimes you don't know what you have until you take a shot at it,"" General Manager Mike Maccagnan said in an interview.For Maccagnan, the idea started percolating during off-season workouts, when it struck him how much Howsare looked like a fullback. Unlike taller, more linear outside linebackers, Howsare, listed as 6 feet 3 inches and 255 pounds, carries his weight through his lower body and legs. In pedigree and in size, he reminded Maccagnan of another defensive end-turned-N.F.L. fullback who played at a smaller college, James Develin of New England.""Watching him as a linebacker roll his hips and take on blockers, you start thinking of it in reverse,"" Maccagnan said of Howsare. ""If he's a fullback and going into the line of scrimmage and uncoiling on contact, he had the flexibility and athletic ability.""The fullback's role has changed over the years, evolving from that of a pure lead blocker -- almost like an extra guard -- to, as spread offenses have infiltrated the league, another pass-catching threat out of the backfield. According to Pro Football Focus, the Jets deployed a fullback on 19.1 percent of their offensive snaps last season, but Bowles said he and coordinator Chan Gailey had yet to determine how often they would use one.""It's not a natural position,"" said the Jets' likely starter, Tommy Bohanon. ""It's not natural to run 5 yards and hit a linebacker square in the face.""The running-5-yards-and-hitting part comes naturally to Howsare. He recorded 39 sacks and 57 tackles for a loss at Clarion, about 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, and developed a reputation as such a dogged and ferocious player that the conference rival California University of Pennsylvania started referring to him as the Chain Saw (when the Cal graduate Rontez Miles learned that Howsare had joined the team, he said, he ran around the Jets' complex asking: ""Where's Chain Saw? Where's Chain Saw?"" until he found him). As a senior, Howsare was selected as a finalist for the award given to the best lineman -- offensive or defensive -- in Division II.""There was no one that could block him,"" Weibel, now the head coach at Clarion, said in a telephone interview. ""There was no one that would put forth the effort or match his effort on the field.""It is everything else that commands a recalibration. However similar Howsare views the responsibilities, the differences greet him every time he lines up.Instead of having the freedom to pursue the ball any way he chooses, he must harness his aggression. If a guard misses a block, Howsare must prevent the play from breaking down before he can proceed to his assignment. If the ball carrier cannot make it back to the line of scrimmage, that, in essence, is Howsare's fault.""The hardest part is really just the flow of the game and learning how to get into the holes and get into your blocks,"" said Bohanon, who switched to fullback from running back as a freshman at Wake Forest. ""It's something you definitely have to learn over a few years.""Howsare does not have a few years. He has a few weeks. The more he can do, Bowles told him, the more appealing he becomes for the Jets or potential employers elsewhere, who will determine the position that fits him best.Whichever position that is.Photograph Linebacker Julian Howsare, Right, Received Pointers Wednesday From Fullback Tommy Bohanon.

Penalties for a Payment Processor:   [Real Estate Desk ],,"Many lenders promote biweekly payment plans as a way to pay down mortgages more quickly. But the programs can sometimes be costly, and, as federal regulators recently found, may promise borrowers more than they actually deliver.Last month, Paymap, a payment processing company and wholly owned subsidiary of Western Union, agreed to return $33.4 million in fees to consumers and pay a $5 million fine in an action brought by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.The bureau charged that Paymap of Englewood, Colo., in partnership with LoanCare, a mortgage servicer in Virginia Beach, marketed an Equity Accelerator program to borrowers by grossly overstating how much they would save in interest by paying their mortgage on a biweekly basis.Paying half the mortgage every other week for a total of 26 payments a year results in 13 full mortgage payments annually instead of the 12 required. This can indeed help borrowers pay off their loans early.But Paymap, on a website and through its employees, oversold the benefits of its program, claiming average interest savings of more than $33,000 without any data to back up the claim, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In reality, the bureau said, ""only a tiny percentage, if any"" of the roughly 125,000 consumers who enrolled in the program over the last four years enjoyed that level of savings.Consumers typically paid a fee of $295 to sign up for the program, essentially an electronic payment system that automatically withdrew money from their bank accounts. Paymap charged a transaction fee of $2.50 for every automatic withdrawal, fees it shared with partner servicers. LoanCare received an estimated $400,000 in customer fees from the program, the bureau said.The bureau also faulted Paymap for telling consumers that their new mortgage payoff schedule would be ""every two weeks."" Even though Paymap withdrew money every two weeks, it didn't transfer the funds to the mortgage servicer until the beginning of the month, the bureau said. The payment schedule did not change.In a statement, the bureau's director, Richard Cordray, said the action against the two companies was intended to send ""a clear message that these practices will not be tolerated.""LoanCare will pay a fine of $100,000. The two companies neither admit nor deny wrongdoing, according to the consent orders.Margot Freeman Saunders, of counsel to the National Consumer Law Center, said she welcomed the bureau's action. The companies charge borrowers to do something they can do on their own, she said, and potentially put them at risk of incurring additional costs, as ""third-party payment companies don't have the same interest you do in preventing late fees.""Rather than paying a company to make additional payments, borrowers should make a habit of sending in extra money on their own, she advised. One way to achieve the same result as a biweekly plan -- making one additional full payment a year -- is to increase the monthly payment by one-twelfth, and specify that the extra be applied to the principal balance. In other words, if the monthly payment is $1,200, pay an additional $100 a month toward the principal, for a total of $1,300.Borrowers can also try a technique Ms. Saunders used: Give your mortgage a raise. If she received, say, a 5 percent pay increase, she raised her mortgage payment by 5 percent. By tacking on a ""raise"" of $50 to $75 a month, ""I paid off my mortgage in 18 years rather than 30,"" she said.Chart Index for Adjustable Rate Mortgages: 1-Year Treasury Rate (Source: Hsh.Com)",0.0

They Can't Be Serious:   Commentary,,"This was, according to many commentators, going to be the election cycle Republicans got to show off their ""deep bench."" The race for the nomination would include experienced governors like Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, fresh thinkers like Rand Paul, and attractive new players like Marco Rubio. Instead, however, Donald Trump leads the field by a wide margin. What happened?The answer, according to many of those who didn't see it coming, is gullibility: People can't tell the difference between someone who sounds as if he knows what he's talking about and someone who is actually serious about the issues. And for sure there's a lot of gullibility out there. But if you ask me, the pundits have been at least as gullible as the public, and still are.For while it's true that Mr. Trump is, fundamentally, an absurd figure, so are his rivals. If you pay attention to what any one of them is actually saying, as opposed to how he says it, you discover incoherence and extremism every bit as bad as anything Mr. Trump has to offer. And that's not an accident: Talking nonsense is what you have to do to get anywhere in today's Republican Party.For example, Mr. Trump's economic views, a sort of mishmash of standard conservative talking points and protectionism, are definitely confused. But is that any worse than Jeb Bush's deep voodoo, his claim that he could double the underlying growth rate of the American economy? And Mr. Bush's credibility isn't helped by his evidence for that claim: the relatively rapid growth Florida experienced during the immense housing bubble that coincided with his time as governor.Mr. Trump, famously, is a ""birther"" -- someone who has questioned whether President Obama was born in the United States. But is that any worse than Scott Walker's declaration that he isn't sure whether the president is a Christian?Mr. Trump's declared intention to deport all illegal immigrants is definitely extreme, and would require deep violations of civil liberties. But are there any defenders of civil liberties in the modern G.O.P.? Notice how eagerly Rand Paul, self-described libertarian, has joined in the witch hunt against Planned Parenthood.And while Mr. Trump is definitely appealing to know-nothingism, Marco Rubio, climate change denier, has made ""I'm not a scientist"" his signature line. (Memo to Mr. Rubio: Presidents don't have to be experts on everything, but they do need to listen to experts, and decide which ones to believe.)The point is that while media puff pieces have portrayed Mr. Trump's rivals as serious men -- Jeb the moderate, Rand the original thinker, Marco the face of a new generation -- their supposed seriousness is all surface. Judge them by positions as opposed to image, and what you have is a lineup of cranks. And as I said, this is no accident.It has long been obvious that the conventions of political reporting and political commentary make it almost impossible to say the obvious -- namely, that one of our two major parties has gone off the deep end. Or as the political analysts Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein put it in their book ""It's Even Worse Than It Looks,"" the G.O.P. has become an ""insurgent outlier ... unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence, and science."" It's a party that has no room for rational positions on many major issues.Or to put it another way, modern Republican politicians can't be serious -- not if they want to win primaries and have any future within the party. Crank economics, crank science, crank foreign policy are all necessary parts of a candidate's resume.Until now, however, leading Republicans have generally tried to preserve a facade of respectability, helping the news media to maintain the pretense that it was dealing with a normal political party. What distinguishes Mr. Trump is not so much his positions as it is his lack of interest in maintaining appearances. And it turns out that the party's base, which demands extremist positions, also prefers those positions delivered straight. Why is anyone surprised?Remember how Mr. Trump was supposed to implode after his attack on John McCain? Mr. McCain epitomizes the strategy of sounding moderate while taking extreme positions, and is much loved by the press corps, which puts him on TV all the time. But Republican voters, it turns out, couldn't care less about him.Can Mr. Trump actually win the nomination? I have no idea. But even if he is eventually pushed aside, pay no attention to all the analyses you will read declaring a return to normal politics. That's not going to happen; normal politics left the G.O.P. a long time ago. At most, we'll see a return to normal hypocrisy, the kind that cloaks radical policies and contempt for evidence in conventional-sounding rhetoric. And that won't be an improvement.",0.0
Debates on Campus:   [Letter ],,"Readers discuss the controversies over free speech and safe spaces on college campuses.To the Editor: Re ""A Crisis Our Universities Deserve"" (column, Nov. 15): Ross Douthat's diatribe against American higher education since the 1960s is, from my experience and observation, simply wrong. Previously higher education was to a very large extent exclusionary, sectarian, tribal, hierarchical, intolerant and dogmatic.Today the vastly variegated panorama of American higher education has by no means reached a state of perfection, but it is more humane by far, filled with students and faculty who listen to one another across large areas of difference, know the value of hard work in an uncertain world and with uncertain personal futures, and are keenly aware of the opportunities and threats that almost fantastical technological change poses.There is substantial evidence that the more exposure to higher education that people today have received, the less likely they are to be susceptible to demagogy and denial of evidence and proven facts; and they are more capable of changing their prejudice-based opinions, and in general better prepared to join in the long effort to make a better world out of the crooked timber of humanity.In an often-daunting world and future, our colleges and universities, contrary to Mr. Douthat's dark vision of corruption and rot, are a major source of hope and confidence.THOMAS H. WRIGHTVieques, P.R.The writer is emeritus vice president and secretary of Princeton University.To the Editor: The two universities I have taught at -- San Diego State University and the University of California at Los Angeles -- bear no resemblance to the generic university that Ross Douthat conjures up. American culture has changed in the half century since the 1960s, and college administrators, along with faculty members and staff, reflect those changes. This is not a descent from virtue. Nowhere does Mr. Douthat make an argument for his assertion that universities are ""genuinely corrupt.""Yes, students want to have a good time, but such a desire is not incompatible with serious study. Contemporary students may not share Mr. Douthat's values, but they are concerned with refining and sharing their own moral vision, and they prefer the dynamism of life to the ossification of old norms.JOYCE APPLEBYTaos, N.M.To the Editor: Re ""The Seduction of Safety,"" by Roxane Gay (Sunday Review, Nov. 15):As a first-year student at a dominantly ""liberal"" university, I believe that we place far too much emphasis on making safe spaces for everyone. Growing up in a world that has suddenly demanded that we watch our language, opinions and even questioning of socially sensitive topics like homosexuality and feminism, many youths such as myself have a tough time expressing our opinions under the social pressure to be ""politically correct.""Safe spaces are designed to allow individual thoughts to flow freely without judgment. I have found they have done the exact opposite. I often find myself clamming up when asked to share an opinion I feel strongly about, simply because it could be considered critical or judgmental of others' opinions.We should always be respectful of all opinions and beliefs, but we should not have to be afraid to share our own, even if they seem ""politically incorrect.""CHRISTOPHER PHILIPPS>ChicagoTo the Editor: Roxane Gay dismisses the perspective of those who criticize the notion of safe spaces as resulting from being able to take one's safety for granted. However, one person's safe space is another person's hostile environment. The adversities that exist in our world are not as simplistic and one-sided as she makes them out to be. There are men who are victims of domestic violence and rape. There are white people who grow up in poverty or have lost a family member to violence at the hands of a police officer. There are heterosexuals who have been perceived by others as gay and suffered from homophobia.Unfortunately, there are those who would seek to make the world a supposed safe space for women, minorities or L.G.B.T. people by suppressing the voices of others who have experienced comparable adversities, thereby denying the very real suffering that they have endured. The way to achieve true healing for everyone is by hearing one another's perspectives with empathy and seeking to find common ground, not by silencing the voices of those whose life stories we find inconvenient or uncomfortable.DAVID GOLUB>New YorkTo the Editor: Re ""Mizzou, Yale and Free Speech,"" by Nicholas Kristof (column, Nov. 12), and ""Who Is Entitled to Be Heard?,"" by Suzanne Nossel (Op-Ed, Nov. 12):While both Mr. Kristof and Ms. Nossel have thoughtful comments on what sort of speech or acts should be allowed on college campuses, I'd urge them both to draw sharper distinctions between insult and opinion. Because most colleges and universities require admitted students to agree to a code of conduct that respects their fellow students, it is perfectly proper to punish students who break that code by use of the N-word, posting lynching cartoons on the door of a black student or wearing insensitive Halloween costumes on university property. Conversely, no student should be barred from a public meeting, no speaker shouted down and no ""Vagina Monologues"" type of performance canceled. Here students may dissent but not disrupt.This distinction gets a little trickier when protests arise over graduation speakers such as Condoleezza Rice or Christine Lagarde, director of the International Monetary Fund. Commencement is not a regular campus event, but rather a special time for all seniors to celebrate regardless of their political views. Here the distinction between insult and opinion is harder to draw, and thus requires us all to think compassionately about a thoroughly complex issue.PETER K. FROST>Williamstown, Mass.The writer is emeritus professor of international relations at Williams College.To the Editor: Nicholas Kristof says ""universities should work harder to make all students feel they are safe and belong."" Nonsense. Such sloppy sentimentality underscores the misdirection of many of our universities and undermines the values that define adult education. No student at an American university should be ""safe"" from ideas, be they noxious or untrue.Higher education is ""higher"" precisely because the best teachers take very great risks in challenging ideas that seem self-evident, even the risk of changing minds. As for belonging, all students were admitted and by definition belong.Safe from violence, yes.

Graft Panel in Malaysia Issues Ruling for Premier:   [Foreign Desk ],,"HONG KONG -- Malaysia's anticorruption body said Monday that nearly $700 million deposited into accounts controlled by Prime Minister Najib Razak did not come from a government-owned development fund now under investigation.Instead, the money came from ""contributions of donors,"" the Malaysian Anticorruption Commission said in a written statement, which did not offer specifics.Mr. Najib has been under scrutiny since news reports said last month that investigators had documented the flow of hundreds of millions of dollars into accounts under his control.Last week, he dismissed the attorney general and reshuffled the cabinet, removing a deputy who had publicly urged him to respond to questions over 1Malaysia Development Berhad, the development fund, which has $11 billion in debt.Mr. Najib has called the suggestions of corruption the work of political opponents trying to undermine him. He and the fund, also known as 1MDB, have denied wrongdoing.The task force looking into the fund includes the anticorruption commission, the attorney general, the inspector general of Malaysia's police and the governor general of the central bank.The anticorruption commission said it would forward to the attorney general the results of its investigation into the money that had gone into the prime minister's accounts.The political storm around Mr. Najib is likely to continue despite the announcement by anticorruption officials. In recent days, officials with his party, the United Malays National Organization, and the governing coalition have said that as party president, he is a trustee authorized to handle political donations. But the former prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, a onetime mentor turned critic of Mr. Najib, wrote on his blog on Monday that the hundreds of millions reported seemed far more than necessary for campaign expenses. Dr. Mahathir said that when he was president of the party, he never had election funds deposited into his personal accounts.Also on Monday, the Malaysian police interviewed Bahri Mohamad Zin, the anticorruption commission's director of special operations, as part of an investigation into leaks of documents related to the 1MDB inquiry, according to Malaysian news reports.Mr. Bahri is the fourth official from the anticorruption body to be questioned in the leak investigation, The Malaysian Insider website and The Malay Mail Online reported. A former adviser and an official in the attorney general's office working with the anticorruption commission were detained over the weekend as part of the leak inquiry, the outlets said.The leak investigation follows articles by The Wall Street Journal and Sarawak Report, a British website, that said investigators had documents that showed hundreds of millions of dollars had flowed into accounts controlled by the prime minister.",0.0
Greece Faces Another Crisis as Migration Surges:   [Foreign Desk ],,"LESBOS, Greece -- The immigration center here, a cluster of prefabricated buildings surrounded by rows of chain-link and barbed-wire fences, was full again on a recent evening, leaving hundreds of families, some with infants, to find a place among the piles of garbage outside.The toilets were clogged and the temperatures still well above 90 degrees. Flies and mosquitoes were everywhere.""Look, her eyes are sick,"" said Ibrahim Nawrozi, a desperate 27-year-old Afghan mechanic, holding up his 10-month-old daughter for inspection. ""We are in this garbage three days. We can't stay here another day.""Since the beginning of the year, the number of refugees and migrants arriving here and on other Greek islands has surged to full-scale humanitarian-crisis levels. Arrivals by sea have surpassed 107,000 through July, according to United Nations figures, eclipsing even the numbers of people reaching Italy. Most of those who arrive on the shores of Lesbos, a popular tourist destination just off the coast of Turkey in the Aegean Sea, are fleeing the wars in Syria and Afghanistan and hoping to head deeper into Western Europe.In June, 15,254 migrants and refugees arrived on Lesbos, according to the Greek Coast Guard, compared with 921 the same month last year.But only squalor awaits them here. They arrive in a country that is deep in its own crisis, with an unemployment rate over 25 percent, banks not fully open and its government all but broke.There are volunteers, both tourists and Greeks, scraping together what assistance they can, offering crackers, water and sometimes dry clothes. But what they muster does not come close to the need. Some of the families outside the center had been unable to get any food that day, elbowed out of the way by others, they said. Some who had gotten food said it made them sick. Human rights groups have called the conditions here and on other nearby islands appalling.Spyros Galinos, the mayor of Lesbos, agrees that conditions are ""awful."" But he said the scale of the problem had been mind-boggling, with 1,500 people arriving on some days.""We had 3,000 people outside the center the other day,"" he said.The migrants and refugees land at all hours, packed into inflatable boats that should hold 15, according to the manufacturer's instructions stamped clearly on the side of boats. But they usually hold 40, sometimes more. They cross from Turkey, where they have paid smugglers about $1,200 for a place on the boat, more if they want life jackets.The distance is as little as three and a half miles in some places. But the overloaded boats, taking in water because they sit so low in the sea, can take hours to make the crossings. Passengers that arrive in the night are often exhausted and freezing. Others arrive sunburned. Some end up throwing everything they own overboard, even wheelchairs.Still, the volunteers who watch for the boats from cliffs say that many of the passengers fall to their knees with happiness when they make it to the rocky beaches here.It was that way for Rosh A., a 32-year-old Syrian teacher, who asked not to be identified by her last name for fear of what might happen to her family back home on the outskirts of Damascus. Rosh said she had made the trip in less than 24 hours, flying to Beirut, Lebanon, and to Istanbul before climbing into an inflatable boat with her two children and three friends. In Damascus, she said, the bombs arrived regularly and basic services were gone.""I was dying there every day,"" she said, as one of her traveling companions used his smartphone to show a video of explosions and fires erupting in the suburbs of the city. ""Yes, it was frightening in that boat, but when I got in it I had a future again.""Once ashore, however, the group faced a 30-mile walk to register with the authorities. The roads are filled day and night with refugees and migrants trudging toward the port town of Mitilini. Some, like Mr. Nawrozi's wife, get so exhausted carrying their children that they abandon their belongings along the road.It is a measure of how few official services there are that those who are rescued by the Coast Guard in the north of the island are brought to Melinda McRostie, who, with her husband, runs a restaurant called the Captain's Table in the nearby town of Molyvos.With donations solicited from a Facebook page, Ms. McRostie has rented a space behind the rows of restaurants overlooking the port. On a recent evening, as tourists chatted, ate grilled fish and tried ouzo out front, 33 young men from Afghanistan, many with blistered lips, were lining up for turkey and cheese sandwiches in the back.Afterward, they bedded down for the night on plastic sheeting. By early morning, another group of 100 Syrians had arrived, one man suffering from hypothermia.""Me,"" Ms. McRostie said, ""I was dealing with it, like I know anything about what to do. We were trying to get his wet clothes off and I think now he was really embarrassed. This morning he wouldn't look at me.""For many residents of the island, the wave of migrants and refugees could hardly come at a worse time of year. The tourist season is in full swing, and restaurants and hotels here depend on the summer months to stay in business. Even those who are volunteering to help the new arrivals are eager to point out that tourists will find the island unchanged. That is true to a large degree. But in the north, the beaches are littered with deflated boats and piles of abandoned life jackets and inflatable tubes.About 60 percent of the arrivals are from Syria. The next largest group, making up about 20 percent, are Afghans. But there are also arrivals from Somalia, Congo, Eritrea and Pakistan, among others.Few stay on the island for very long. The authorities have stepped up the processing of papers so that most can take a ferry -- at their own expense -- to the mainland within three or four days. From there, most say they will make their way out of Greece, through Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary to Austria and beyond. Many hope to go to Germany, Sweden, Denmark or Norway.The authorities have set up two encampments, but they are not managed in any way. There is nobody to settle disputes or answer questions about the constantly changing system of processing papers. Police officers can arrive at any time to hand out papers, but they do not even have a bullhorn, so people often fear that they have not heard their names being called.Rosh and her children have their papers, for instance, as do two of her traveling companions. But the sixth member of the group has not received his papers and they have no idea why, or any means of finding out. So, they wait, settled in the stifling heat by a tree that they joke is their air-conditioner.""You know,"" Rosh said, ""I never even had to worry about money a day in my life before.""At the registration center, a police major, Kostas Papazoglou, said that the staff was overwhelmed, but that there were no reinforcements to be had.The police, he said, were paying for food, but on a budget of less than 6 euros, or about $6.60, per person per day. There was no money for clearing the garbage from the area or tending to the toilets.""Ten days ago, there were 2,000 people here,"" he said. ""And the Syrians had closed the road in protest, a fight had broken out up top in the encampment and there was a fire. We had 10 officers here trying to deal with all of that.""Anastasia Christodoulopoulou, Greece's minister of migration policy, said she hoped to start receiving more funds from the European Union soon. The country, she said, did not have the resources to do much on its own, with so many Greeks struggling themselves.""I mean, there is a humanitarian crisis here, with 1.5 million unemployed, with three million poor, with homeless people, and we are not able to cover their basic needs,"" she said. ""And in this situation, we are called to also cover the needs of people who are even weaker.""But some on Lesbos say Greeks must summon the means to help despite their own suffering. The Rev. Stratis Dimou, a Greek Orthodox priest who has provided a way station for hundreds of immigrants walking the 30 miles from the north of the island to south, said there were perhaps 100 Greek families in his town, which was once prosperous from construction work, who now depend on charity to survive.Yet, Father Dimou said, additional efforts must still be made to help the new arrivals. ""These people are just trying to take care of themselves,"" he said. ""They are just trying to survive.""He said that one day a woman had become separated from her husband, so he took her in his car to search for him.""When we found him,"" Father Dimou said, ""he came over to my car. He bowed and he kissed me, and at that moment I realized there are no borders.""Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

A Word Too Far? 'Blood' Remark Tests the G.O.P.:   [National Desk ],,"Donald J. Trump's suggestion that a Fox News journalist had questioned him forcefully at the Republican presidential debate because she was menstruating cost him a speaking slot Saturday night at an influential gathering of conservatives in Atlanta. It also raised new questions about how much longer Republican Party leaders would have to contend with Mr. Trump's disruptive presence in the primary field.Continuing his complaints about Megyn Kelly, one of the moderators of the debate, in an interview on CNN Friday night, Mr. Trump said, ""You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever."" The remark prompted Erick Erickson, the leader of RedState, the conservative group, to disinvite him.""If your standard-bearer has to resort to that,"" Mr. Erickson told hundreds of conservative activists in a packed Atlanta hotel ballroom on Saturday, ""we need a new standard-bearer.""With Mr. Trump at center stage Thursday in Cleveland, Fox News shattered television viewership records for a primary debate: Nearly 24 million people watched. But any hopes that Mr. Trump, the real estate developer and television celebrity, would try to reinvent himself as a sober-minded statesman, or that he would collapse under scrutiny and tough questions, vaporized in the opening minutes when he refused to rule out running as an independent candidate for president. His remarks Friday only furthered the impression that he also had no intention of speaking more carefully. Mr. Trump denied on Saturday that he had been implying that Ms. Kelly was menstruating. ""I think only a degenerate would think that I would have meant that,"" he said in an interview, insisting that he had been referring to Ms. Kelly's nose and ears.But as his latest eruption rippled through Republican circles, the conversation turned to whether the party, and his rival presidential contenders, should continue to accommodate his candidacy, quietly hoping that this would be the moment he burned out -- or whether they should try to run him out on a rail.If party leaders saw danger in provoking a breakup -- and no small advantage to be seized from the ratings bonanza Mr. Trump showed himself capable of delivering -- there were signs that other influential Republicans would tolerate only so much of Mr. Trump's behavior.""Come on,"" Jeb Bush, who has campaigned as the adult among the party's 17 presidential candidates, said in his remarks at the RedState gathering. ""Give me a break. Do we want to win? Do we want to insult 53 percent of all voters? What Donald Trump said is wrong.""Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, who delivered perhaps the most assertive turn in Thursday's debate among the candidates trailing in the polls, posted on Twitter: ""Mr. Trump: There. Is. No. Excuse."" Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina went further, saying, ""Enough already with Mr. Trump.""Yet in a sign of the lingering reluctance among some in the field to anger Mr. Trump's supporters, other candidates, including former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, would not condemn Mr. Trump's comments.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, in an interview to be broadcast Sunday, praised Ms. Kelly but stopped short of calling on Mr. Trump to apologize. ""I've made a decision here with Donald Trump, you know, if I comment on everything he says, my whole campaign will be consumed by it,"" he said. ""That's all I'll do all day.""Mr. Rubio made the comments to Chuck Todd in a taped interview for NBC's ""Meet the Press.""Mr. Erickson -- an author with his own track record of inflammatory remarks, sometimes about women -- announced just before midnight Friday on the RedState website that he was disinviting Mr. Trump. He wrote that he admired Mr. Trump for his bluntness and for connecting with ""so much of the anger in the Republican base.""""But there are even lines blunt talkers and unprofessional politicians should not cross,"" he wrote. ""Decency is one of those lines.""He added, ""I just don't want someone on stage who gets a hostile question from a lady and his first inclination is to imply it was hormonal.""Mr. Trump's campaign shot back at Mr. Erickson, calling him a ""weak and pathetic leader"" and his decision ""another example of weakness through being politically correct.""But on Saturday, Mr. Trump seemed to recognize that he needed to create a diversion from the latest controversy and declared that he had fired Roger Stone, a Republican strategist and mischief-maker who had long been an adviser. But Mr. Stone said in an interview that he had resigned because the tenor of the campaign was distracting from Mr. Trump's core message.In an interview with The New York Times on Friday afternoon, before he went on CNN, Mr. Trump said he was irritated by the debate moderators' questions about a third-party candidacy, saying he wanted to run as a Republican, but he reiterated his threat to mount one if he is unhappy with his treatment by party leaders. An independent candidacy would be complicated and costly, he said, but ""if you're rich, it's doable.""Some Republicans were trying to determine just who was rallying to Mr. Trump's side, and how damaging it would be if his supporters left the party's fold.""Trump isn't and wasn't going to get the conservative vote,"" Joseph W. McQuaid, publisher of the Union Leader newspaper in New Hampshire, said in an email. ""Conservative Republicans are worried about their party, but it's still their party. Trump isn't philosophically a conservative, and that will come out.""""Trump's base is more the people who used to have season tickets to the Roman Colosseum,"" Mr. McQuaid wrote. ""Not sure that they vote in great numbers, but they like blood sport.""But others on the right said the disaffected voters rallying to Mr. Trump represented a constituency that Republicans would be foolish to ignore.""People have to get their minds wrapped around the fact that the seething fury at the leadership of the Republican Party is real, and it's going to bubble over somehow with somebody, and right now it's with Trump,"" said the conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham, noting that there were ""a lot of ticked-off people out there who are willing to throw both parties into the fire.""Mr. Erickson himself got a taste of Mr. Trump's die-hard loyalists, recounting in his speech at the conference Saturday that he had received a vitriolic response to his decision to bar Mr. Trump.""We will not gain the White House,"" said Mr. Erickson about the inflammatory messages he had received, ""if we're screaming at people, calling them whores and queer and the N-word.""Even before Friday night, prominent Republican women said they were worried about how female voters would respond to Mr. Trump's prominence on the debate stage, where he defended imprecations like ""fat pigs"" and ""bimbo"" to describe women -- and his rivals did not chide him.But Mr. Trump's comment Friday night about Ms. Kelly caused a new bout of consternation among senior Republican leaders, who saw it as the latest distraction from the business of choosing a presidential candidate who can return the White House to the party in 2016.""We need to nominate somebody who can win, somebody who is substantive and somebody who knows how to govern,"" said former Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire. ""But we can't have that debate in the full jacket as long as we're sidetracked off on this Trump exercise. It does undermine our ability to have a substantive debate. All the substantive arguments are being muted by his persona.""Still, Mr. Gregg said that while RedState was wise to bar him from its event, the party would only ""make him an even larger figure"" by trying to keep him out of future debates. ""He'd love that,"" Mr. Gregg said. ""He loves when institutional forces take him on. That's part of his shtick.""He added: ""The campaign is serious, but his campaign isn't. It's entertainment. What's the line of decency in the entertainment world? It's pretty far out there.""Some in the party have mused privately about using Mr. Trump's refusal to rule out an independent bid as grounds to bar him from future debates, but there is deep concern that such a heavy-handed effort would only prod him into pursuing such a run.It also appeared unlikely that any network could be persuaded to exclude him. As Mr. Trump crowed Friday in a telephone interview, ""I'm a ratings machine.""In Atlanta, there was resignation to the likelihood that Mr. Trump would continue to draw support from voters looking to rage against the political establishment. But some of the grass-roots activists in attendance described him as a jester, not a threat.David Pettigrew, a retiree from Milledgeville, Ga., said he knew many conservatives who regretted voting for Ross Perot in 1992 out of frustration with President George Bush. (Mr. Perot's third-party candidacy is widely believed to have helped tilt the election to Bill Clinton.) But he said he doubted Mr. Trump could win over enough disgruntled Republicans to undermine the party's nominee.""Hell, if he wants to run as a third party, have at it,"" Mr. Pettigrew said.Mr. Trump, for his part, fired off a defiant salute to the RedState crowd on Twitter Saturday morning: ""I miss you all, and thanks for all of your support. Political correctness is killing our country.""He added in a word what he thought of his critics: ""weakness.""Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitterand the First Draft newsletter.",0.0
When Architecture Meets Pop Culture:   [Style Desk ],,"For a serious architect who has designed public housing in Dallas and a bridge in Slovenia, it may come as a surprise that Oana Stanescu's best-known work is a 50-foot-high volcano that Kanye West ascended onstage during his grandiose Yeezus tour.But then again, Ms. Stanescu, 32, is not your typical bespectacled architect, reaching for trophy buildings or lucrative commissions.Along with Dong-Ping Wong, her partner in the West Village architectural firm Family, Ms. Stanescu is making a name for herself in design circles for her ability to merge pop culture with utilitarian design.Her firm recently completed the Hong Kong flagship store of Off-White, a high-end streetwear brand started by Virgil Abloh, Mr. West's creative director. Ms. Stanescu is one of the designers behind the +Pool project, which is seeking to install a floating swimming pool in the East River. Other clients have included Marina Abramovic and the New Museum in New York.""Oana is a creative ticking time bomb; she never stops,"" said Carl Jackson, 41, a filmmaker who recently hired Family to design two projects in San Diego: a film studio and a sustainable housing community.Ms. Stanescu's penchant for pop culture began in Resita, an industrial town in western Romania, where she grew up watching British MTV and listening to Guns N' Roses' ""Appetite for Destruction."" They offered an escape from Romania, which was in the violent throes of a revolution and the ouster of Nicolae Ceausescu.""I have memories of hiding in the basement, sleeping on floors where there were no windows,"" she said.Ms. Stanescu studied architecture at Polytechnic University of Timisoara in western Romania. Midway through the six-year program, she landed an internship at REX in New York, formerly a branch of Rem Koolhaas's prestigious Office of Metropolitan Architecture.From there, she worked at other top architecture firms, including Sanaa in Japan, Herzog & de Meuron in Switzerland and Architecture for Humanity in South Africa, before joining Family in 2013.""At one point, my mom said, 'There aren't enough continents for you,' "" Ms. Stanescu said.She now lives in a sunny townhouse in Harlem, which she shares with friends and a dog named Perry, and teaches a graduate-level design course at Columbia University, a short walk away.Her most famous client remains Mr. West, for whom she is working on several projects, the details of which she cannot disclose. The two met when he hired the Office of Metropolitan Architecture to design a viewing pavilion for his short film ""Cruel Summer"" during the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. The association has given her a taste of tabloid scrutiny, with several media outlets, including Glamour magazine UK and Metro, inaccurately crediting her with baby-proofing Mr. West's homes.""How strange,"" she said of her brush with the gossip mill. ""Design is at its best when it's collaborative. I'm interested in pushing the boundaries of what architecture can do.""Photograph Oana Stanescu, with an Architectural Model, Likes to Push Boundaries.

SpongeBob Outguns 'Sniper' at Box Office:   [Brief ],,"After successfully returning the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to the multiplex, Paramount has pulled off the same trick with another aging cartoon crew. ""The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water"" soaked up a stellar $56 million at North American theaters over the weekend, demonstrating the power of nostalgia and the promotional strength of Nickelodeon, Paramount's corporate sibling.But the weekend also brought two big-budget bombs, with the $200 million ""Jupiter Ascending"" shaping up as yet another misfire from Andy and Lana Wachowski -- it managed only about $19 million in ticket sales -- and the $100 million fantasy ""Seventh Son"" generating a feeble $7.1 million.""The SpongeBob Movie,"" which cost about $74 million to make and benefited from light family-audience competition, was easily the No. 1 draw, dethroning ""American Sniper"" (Warner), which fell to second place after three consecutive weekends in the top spot. ""American Sniper"" took in about $24.2 million, for a new domestic total of $282.3 million, according to Rentrak, which compiles box-office data.""Jupiter Ascending,"" from Warner and Village Roadshow, arrived in third place, suffering from poor reviews and a lingering stink created by a delayed release; Warner had initially planned a July debut. The Wachowskis have now delivered three mega-duds a row, following ""Speed Racer"" and ""Cloud Atlas."" Warner said ""Jupiter Ascending"" took in an additional $32.5 million overseas over the weekend.""Seventh Son,"" delayed at least three times in its release and receiving even worse reviews, arrived in fourth place. A decent $86 million in overseas ticket sales (and counting) for ""Seventh Son"" will help cushion the blow, but Legendary Entertainment has already taken a steep write-down on the movie, which was distributed by Universal. ""Paddington"" chugged along in fifth place, taking in $5.4 million, for a four-week domestic total for the Weinstein Company of $57.3 million.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Photograph (Photograph by Paramount Pictures)",0.0
New Meningitis Strain in Africa Brings Call for More Vaccines:   [Foreign Desk ],,"Meningitis may be poised for a ferocious comeback in Africa, international aid organizations are warning, and vaccine manufacturers must step up production if the outbreak is to be averted.Meningitis is caused by one of several strains of the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. A vaccine introduced five years ago has all but defeated meningitis A infections in Africa. But infections with another strain, Type C, are on the rise.Some experts fear the new strain will explode next year, while others say too little is known to predict its course reliably.Meningitis C vaccines exist but are expensive: $20 per shot is the lowest price offered thus far to an international public health consortium, led by the World Health Organization, that stockpiles vaccines for emergencies.The consortium, the International Coordinating Group for Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control, is seeking five million doses. To be effective, they must be shipped and injected before January, when meningitis normally returns to Africa with the dry harmattan winds.Unless something drastic happens -- a surge of donor money, or huge price cuts -- the consortium's experts do not hold out much hope.""If we don't get the doses, we'll be having a really hard time,"" said Dr. William A. Perea, coordinator of the W.H.O.'s epidemic diseases control unit. ""So we are making a little noise.""The global vaccine industry is fragile. Because of mergers and acquisitions, only four major pharmaceutical companies -- GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi-Pasteur, Merck and Pfizer -- still make vaccines for diseases other than flu. They are primarily interested in serving wealthy countries, where they can charge $100 or more per dose.As a result, there are too few factories to supply the vaccines poor countries need, and also little competition to drive down prices.""Vaccine pricing has traditionally been much more secretive than drug pricing,"" said Kate Elder, vaccines policy adviser at Doctors Without Borders. ""When we survey companies, they never tell us how they arrive at prices.""State-owned factories in India, Brazil, Cuba and elsewhere also manufacture meningitis vaccines. While they can sometimes be paid to make more than their own countries need, many are reliant on old technology and hampered by government bureaucracies.A low-priced vaccine against meningitis C and four other strains of the infection is being developed in India but will need at least another five years of testing.Meningitis used to strike thousands of Africans every year. In 1997, meningitis sickened 250,000 people and killed 25,000.Survivors also suffer. A quarter are left brain-damaged, paralyzed, prone to seizures or without limbs that had to be amputated. In African schools for the deaf, most students are meningitis victims.Desperate families often sell everything to pay for care: chickens, cows, even front doors, which in West Africa can be elaborately carved heirlooms.Type A bacteria were once responsible for more than 80 percent of Africa's meningitis cases, but that infection is being vanquished by a new vaccine, MenAfriVac, which was introduced in 2010 by the W.H.O., the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and PATH, a Seattle health technology group. Over 220 million doses against Type A, made by the Serum Institute of India for 50 cents each, have been injected.But that success has had an alarming coda. Two years ago, a new Type C strain appeared, a genetic variant from the previous Type C. In April, a serious outbreak in Niger sickened nearly 6,000 people and caused nearly 500 deaths.""There was a lot of anxiety, because very few people in Niger didn't know somebody who'd gotten ill or died in the past,"" said Dr. Sarah A. Meyer, an epidemiologist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who helped fight the outbreak. ""People prayed for the rains to start. And they started rushing to the pharmacy for vaccines.""Experts are now fiercely debating what will happen when the harmattan winds return to Africa's so-called meningitis belt, which stretches from the Atlantic Coast to Ethiopia.Experts at the W.H.O. and Doctors Without Borders fear that the new strain will spread. But others, including Dr. Meyer and colleagues at the C.D.C., say there is no way to predict that with confidence. Previous outbreaks of meningitis C -- in Europe, for example -- have not followed the pattern typical of Type A in Africa: a few low-level years, then an explosive epidemic.""The idea that there is a death knell sounding for these countries is exaggerated,"" said Dr. Marc LaForce, a meningitis expert who led the development of MenAfriVac.But the new Type C strain is not identical to its European ancestor, ""so one has to prepare,"" said Dr. Olivier Ronveaux, an epidemiologist at the W.H.O.Over the next few weeks, his agency hopes to swab the throats of Africans across the belt to see how many carry the new Type C strain without symptoms. That may help predict what will happen in January.On a much smaller scale, a similar strain substitution took place on American college campuses in the last decade. Expensive new quadrivalent vaccines, effective against multiple strains of meningitis, were introduced in 2005 and reduced infections with Types A, C, W and Y by more than 90 percent.Then, in 2013, the B strain surged, causing outbreaks at Princeton and the University of California, Santa Barbara. One student died. The Obama administration responded by importing a meningitis B vaccine that had been approved in Europe but not in the United States.Meningitis often strikes young people and can progress from a bad headache to death so quickly that hospital care comes too late, even in the United States.Mysteriously, Neisseria bacteria spread easily in saliva and harmlessly colonize the throats of about a fifth of the world's population. The bacteria kill only if they reach the bloodstream or the meninges, membranes protecting the brain and spine.In the West, ""freshman meningitis"" or ""boot camp meningitis"" affects people gathered in dorms or barracks who adopt new habits like sharing beer bottles, toothbrushes, cigarettes or joints -- or kissing.In Africa, meningitis surges when cold winds force families indoors and dry out throats, opening tiny cracks through which bacteria enter the blood.The world used to rely on polysaccharide vaccines, which are cheap, but their protection does not last long, and they do not kill silent throat infections.About 20 years ago, conjugate vaccines were introduced. By coupling the polysaccharides -- sugarlike molecules from the bacterial membranes -- to proteins, they provoke long-lasting immune responses and can also clear silent infections.Six strains of the meningitis bacteria -- A, B, C, W, X and Y -- cause disease. GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi make conjugate vaccines against A, C, W and Y, and have made some of them available to the W.H.O. at lower prices. But the manufacturers cannot produce enough for a major outbreak.The Serum Institute of India is working on a vaccine against five strains -- all but B -- but it will not be finished until about 2020, Dr. LaForce said, assuming it passes all clinical trials.Vaccines against Type B bacteria must be made differently because the polysaccharides on the membrane of that strain resemble some on the surface of human nerve cells, so there is a risk that making antibodies to them could cause a dangerous autoimmune reaction.Photograph Somali Mothers Waiting in Line in Mogadishu to Have Their Babies Vaccinated Against Meningitis and Other Diseases in 2013.

Chinese Official Criticizes U.S. on Internet Security Policy:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"HONG KONG -- Just days after China and the United States hailed a high-level agreement limiting cyberattacks, a former commander of one of the Chinese military's top hacking units lashed out at American Internet policy, in a sign of how far apart Beijing and Washington remain on technology issues.In prepared remarks on Tuesday, Hao Yeli, the former deputy head of the Fourth Department of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department -- which is responsible for the Chinese military's offensive electronic warfare -- said that the United States had double standards with online surveillance and that the uncertainty behind the origin of digital attacks makes it difficult to apply traditional rules of engagement to the Internet.Ms. Hao's speech punctured some of the cautious optimism analysts had expressed about last week's agreement between the United States and China, which was intended to rein in hacking theft of intellectual property and create international standards for ""appropriate conduct in cyberspace."" Speaking at an Internet security conference in Beijing that also featured a former National Security Agency director, Keith B. Alexander, Ms. Hao challenged the position generally favored by American politicians.Referring to the Arab Spring, Ms. Hao -- now the deputy director of the China Institute for Innovation and Development Strategy -- warned that taking away developing countries' ability to control public opinion through Internet controls and surveillance would result not in more openness, but instead in ""blood"" and ""hatred,"" according to an official transcript of her speech.Though Ms. Hao ultimately called for greater communication between the world's two largest economies, she also said the United States should be less imperious in dictating how governments of other countries manage their own Internet, and in general behave online.""America spreads the ideas of democracy widely across the world, but in cyberspace, it's the opposite,"" she said. ""The United States continuously maintains a system to monitor the rest of the world but asks other countries to strictly control themselves and remain within bounds. This unsymmetrical line of thinking continues.""Ms. Hao and Mr. Alexander, whose speech largely called for cooperation between the United States and China on the shared threat of online attacks, both spoke as part of the China Internet Security Conference sponsored by the Chinese online security and search firm Qihoo 360.Likening China and the United States to strangers walking in the dark who mistake each other for ghosts, Ms. Hao said it was critical for each country to stop demonizing the other and instead begin a broader dialogue.Ms. Hao also said any new rules of engagement for online attacks would probably be different from those used in other forms of warfare.""Because of the complexities and uncertainties of cyberspace, many of the rules of engagement applied normally would be difficult to directly follow,"" she said.",0.0

A Plague of Bucks and Does:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. Last month, a stag reportedly gored a German shepherd named Sprocket, puncturing the dog's lung with an antler. Two days later, one jumped through a window at a T.J. Maxx store, then bounded bloodied up and down the aisles of clothes.At least one poacher has been convicted of killing deer and local streets have seen an increase in crashes involving them. The animals' rambunctiousness is not unusual during the fall rutting season when they get lusty and excited while seeking mates.But this activity is not occurring in an alpine enclave. It is happening on Staten Island.What began as a novelty -- a small, incongruous herd of almost-urban white-tailed deer -- has, according to environmental officials and local leaders, become a safety issue as the animals have multiplied and their behavior has begun to put more drivers in this car-centric borough at risk. The increase in the deer population has also has divided Staten Island into several factions, including those who want to feed them peanut butter and those who want them dead.That groups of deer inhabit parts of New York City is not a new development. But now, with their numbers continuing to grow and the fall mating season in full swing, the incidence of human-deer friction has escalated, as have concerns that something must be done.Next month, in a move more common to the suburbs, the city's Transportation Department plans to post deer-warning signs in parts of the borough after dozens of crashes and untold close calls.Unwilling to wait for official action, some residents, like Brian and Jean Nutley of Rockland Avenue have spent their own money on signs warning drivers to beware of deer.Though deer were once unusual on Staten Island, their numbers have soared in recent years. A tally by the State Department of Environmental Conservation counted just two dozen in 2008. Last year, an infrared aerial survey by the city's Parks Department found nearly 800 -- a figure that some say is too low.James S. Oddo, the Staten Island borough president, has been particularly vocal about the threat posed by the cervidae, as the deer family is called, out of concern about their potential to harm more than a fender.Deer graze on underbrush, Mr. Oddo said, and seem to prefer native species of plants. Left unchecked, their nibbling could denude the island's wooded areas and deliver a blow to biodiversity.Tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease are another concern, he said, though he acknowledged that there was no evidence of an increase in cases. There were 37 car crashes involving deer last year and 30 so far this year, according to the Police Department.""What once was a novelty, and fun, is now a legitimate threat to the environment,"" Mr. Oddo said, ""and to the health and well-being of people.""And dogs. On Oct. 29, a deer leapt the fence at Robert Cutrona's house in the Todt Hill neighborhood. The family believes it gored Sprocket with its antlers, piercing the 5-year-old dog's lung, according to Robert Cutrona Sr., Mr. Cutrona's father. Nobody actually saw what happened, he said, but ""the deer had been prowling around"" on previous days. The dog, which was examined by a veterinarian, is recovering. ""Everybody kind of analyzed the wound on the animal,"" the elder Mr. Cutrona said. ""They indicated it could only be a deer's antlers.""Other incidents involving deer have been confirmed. On Halloween, a stag bashed through the glass at a T.J. Maxx on Forest Avenue shortly before the store opened, Doreen Thompson, a spokeswoman for the company, said. ""Thankfully, none of our store associates were injured,"" Ms. Thompson said in a statement. The badly wounded deer was euthanized.Beyond the roughly two dozen warning signs that the Transportation Department will install where deer are known to live, other efforts are underway to control the animals. Fencing has been installed around new trees, including a $400,000 fence surrounding the former Brookfield Landfill to protect it while it is being refurbished as a park, according to city officials. The department has disseminated fliers in three languages to teach residents about living with deer. (One lesson: Don't feed them.)A deer task force was convened last year, encompassing representatives of nearly a dozen state and federal agencies that met to discuss strategies. Though the group was formed to address the issue citywide, its primary focus has been on Staten Island. At a recent meeting, park officials with experience at the Fire Island National Seashore, where deer are sometimes hand-fed by beachgoers, offered tips, according to city officials.The federal Agriculture Department is conducting its own environmental review of the effect of the deer on Staten Island, a requirement before any steps to mitigate the problem are taken. Such steps could include sterilizing deer or otherwise reducing their numbers.Some people refuse to wait. Though it is illegal to hunt in New York City, a Staten Island resident, David Oakes, was convicted in March of poaching and ordered to pay a $3,000 fine, after an investigation by environmental enforcement officers found he had shot several deer with a bow and arrow, leaving beheaded corpses behind.Mr. Oakes could not be reached for comment.Several headless deer carcasses have turned up elsewhere on Staten Island, according to a senior environmental official with knowledge of the investigation of Mr. Oakes who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, suggesting that Mr. Oakes was not the only one to take matters into his own hands.Other residents are far kinder. The official said he had come across piles of bread slices carefully spread with peanut butter left in the woods for deer who, like four-footed gourmands, lick off just the nutty spread. He also met with neighbors bereft when a favorite local buck known as Rudy in the Mount Loretto area went missing.Naomi and Howard Kastner's children delight in the deer that leap from between the trees each evening. But that was before the family almost careened into a deer and her offspring on an early drive. They drive more cautiously now, but still stop short of wanting the deer gone.""Getting rid of them? I don't see it,"" Ms. Kastner said. ""It's nature.""",0.0
World Briefing | Asia; Myanmar: Official Tally Is Announced:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BANGKOK -- Myanmar's election commission on Friday announced the final tally of the country's Nov. 8 landmark election, a rout by the opposition, led by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.Her party, the National League for Democracy, won 390 seats compared with 42 for the governing party, a state-run television station reported in its Friday evening broadcast. The remaining 59 available seats in Parliament were won by smaller parties. One-quarter of the seats were not contested and are controlled by the military.The victory gives Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's party a large majority in Parliament and the right to select a new president early next year.Both the president and the head of the military have congratulated Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi on her party's performance. But they have also given mixed signals about the timing of the transfer of power, which, according to the Constitution, must be carried out by March.

How Argentina 'Suicides' the Truth:   Commentary,,"BUENOS AIRES -- POLITICAL ""suicides"" are so common in Argentina that a special word has been invented for them.Ask different people in Buenos Aires today and they may disagree whether the crusading prosecutor Alberto Nisman was murdered or took his own life. But most everyone will concur that Mr. Nisman was ""suicided,"" the latest victim of a dark-power centrifuge that with sinister regularity spews out dead bodies in this divided nation.The historical record does not bode well for clarity in the Nisman case. Juan Duarte, older brother of Argentina's political saint, Eva Perón, committed ""suicide"" in 1953, nine months after his sister had thrown the nation into a paroxysm of grief over her own early death, at age 33, from cancer.Embroiled in corruption scandals and suspected of playing a hand in the smuggling of Nazi funds to Argentina, Mr. Duarte was found, like Mr. Nisman, alone, with a bullet in his head. To this day, historians debate the real cause of Mr. Duarte's death.The head-scratching continues over more recent mysterious deaths. Héctor Febres, an officer in charge of the so-called ""maternity ward"" at the notorious Navy Mechanics School in Buenos Aires that became a death camp for thousands of political prisoners during the 1976-83 military dictatorship, was found dead by cyanide poisoning in his cell in 2007.An apparent suicide, he was believed by many to have been murdered, to silence him about the human rights crimes for which he was on trial.The Febres case resonates today. Mr. Nisman died the day before he was to appear before Congress to substantiate his charges against President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for conspiring with Iran. And the judge who investigated Mr. Febres's death, Sandra Arroyo Salgado, was married to Mr. Nisman at the time.Ms. Arroyo Salgado reached the conclusion that Mr. Febres was killed by former comrades who feared he would speak about one of the most heinous of the junta's crimes: keeping pregnant political prisoners alive until they gave birth, then murdering them, and handing over their babies to ""good"" military families to raise as their own.A higher court overturned Judge Arroyo Salgado's attempt to prosecute the officers she suspected of Mr. Febres's death. Another unsolved ""suicide.""Sometimes, one death is not enough to cover up the corruption and criminality of Argentina's shady establishment. The invisible ""mechanics"" who silence troublesome witnesses have not balked at blowing up entire city blocks. On Nov. 3, 1995, a huge explosion rocked Río Tercero in the central province of Córdoba, killing seven people, injuring hundreds and devastating wide areas of the small city.The explosion, whose epicenter was a weapons factory, was allegedly designed to cover up missing armaments that the government had secretly sold to Ecuador and Croatia, in violation of international agreements. In 2013, former President Carlos Menem was convicted of the arms smuggling, and last December, four military officers were convicted of the explosion. (Both sentences are pending appeals.)Intimidation of court officials is routine. Only last month, Judge Claudio Bonadío, handling charges against the president regarding irregularities in a hotel business she owns, received a death threat assembled from cutout letters.""Argentina is monotonous, it repeats its tragedies,"" says Santiago Kovadloff, a 72-year-old philosopher who, in the aftermath of Mr. Nisman's death, has emerged as the country's moral compass. ""There is a long sequence of evidence that highlights the predominance of heinous crime over legality.""It was in this context of corruption's pervading every layer of political life that Mr. Nisman presented his explosive charges against the president in court on Jan. 14. The countless hours of phone intercepts on which they were based revealed a conspiratorial underworld unlike anything a prosecutor had dared reveal before.The wiretaps included a call from someone close to the president, speaking from inside the presidential palace, allegedly transmitting a secret message to Iran. Mr. Nisman claimed the president planned to shield from prosecution five Iranian suspects charged with the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that left 85 dead in 1994.In the brief four days that we now know were left to him, Mr. Nisman went on a fearless media blitz, discussing, in his trademark motormouth style, a world of government subterfuge that had never been exposed in such detail.""I know I could get killed over this,"" he said, as he gave a whirlwind tour of revelation upon revelation.The prosecutor was shining light on a corrupt system of secret influences and covert agents across the government. ""It's a structure that is repeated everywhere,"" says Mr. Kovadloff.And then, amid the shock and outrage, Mr. Nisman died. Or was ""suicided,"" to add a final ingredient of unfathomable mystery to the mix. The effect of all this on Argentina is unlike anything else in recent times. Mr. Nisman was only a prosecutor, but his death is dressed in the awed stupefaction of a Kennedy-level event.AuthorAffiliation UKI GONI Uki Goñi, a writer and journalist, is the author of ""The Real Odessa: Smuggling the Nazis to Perón's Argentina.""Illustration Drawing (Drawing by Cun Shi)",0.0
A Record With Barely a Ripple:   [Sports Desk ],,"KAZAN, Russia -- Out of the water, Katie Ledecky does little to draw attention to herself. She dresses demurely, wears her hair in a relaxed bob and is quiet in a crowd, content to leave the performing to others. When she does talk, she speaks the way she writes: succinctly, with nary a run-on sentence.The swimming pool is Ledecky's phone booth. She enters it and changes into a superhero who swoops into public consciousness a couple of times a year to single-handedly save distance swimming from disappearing off the face of the earth.The three preliminary heats of the women's 1,500-meter freestyle, Ledecky's only race of the day at the world championships, were placed at the end of Monday's morning session for a reason. By that time, most of the athletes and many of the fans had left, leaving the 15,000-seat Kazan Arena less than a quarter full. Even before the advent of the short attention span, the universal belief has been that meets can be enough of an exercise in endurance without subjecting spectators to the scene of bodies swimming facedown in the water for several minutes or more.Then along came Ledecky. In her own low-key way, she has made people stand up and take notice of her and the long races that fuel her journey of self-discovery. Singular feats of human achievement never grow mundane, and what Ledecky, 18, would produce on this sleepy morning was her eighth world record in the past two years.As Ledecky settled into her metronomic pace, the traffic in the warm-down pool, which usually flows in a steady current, clogged up as swimmers stopped or hopped out of the pool to glance at the giant video screen and check her progress.The few thousand people left in the building gradually stirred to life as the scoreboard flashed splits that showed Ledecky was under her world-record pace. The distance between Ledecky and her nearest competitor, Jessica Ashwood of Australia, stretched from two body lengths to 20 meters, then to almost 29 seconds.Roughly a dozen of Ledecky's American teammates moved down from the top of the grandstands and cajoled a taciturn security guard into letting them reposition themselves in a corner closest to the starting blocks so she could better hear their cheers.By the final lap, some Russian fans in the grandstand at the end of the pool, opposite the starting blocks, were banging their CheerStix together as if they were cymbals. In the grandstands running the length of the pool, on the side where Ledecky breathed on the even laps, stood her parents, her uncle and her brother, who was operating a video camera in his right hand and gesturing madly with his left, trying to hurry her home.Ledecky stopped the clock in 15 minutes 27.71 seconds, which was 65-hundredths of a second better than her record time in last summer's Pan Pacific Championships. She laughed when she saw the time. It was like Taylor Swift taping herself singing in the shower and having the recording become the best-selling song of all time.Ledecky's instructions from her coach, Bruce Gemmell, had been to treat the swim as a standard warm-up: Swim the first 900 meters easy, increase the effort over the next 300 meters, and swim the last 300 meters in whatever way she preferred. Ledecky thought she had done an exemplary job of following his directions, which accounted for her stunned look when she saw her time blazing on the scoreboard.In 2015, only 14 American men have gone faster over 1,500 meters. Ledecky's time would make her 96th in the men's world rankings.As she let the time settle in, Ledecky leaned across the lane line, locked eyes with Gemmell and shrugged. Athletes from every sport and of any skill level could surely read the message conveyed by her body language: Sometimes the less you consciously try, the more you conspicuously achieve.""I think the biggest takeaway is when you can relax and perform without expectations,"" Gemmell said, ""those are where the highest-level performances come.""He added, ""When you can relax and not have expectations and let yourself perform at the level you've prepared for, sometimes you get your best performances.""Ledecky, who came up maddeningly short in her world-record bid in the 400 freestyle Sunday, offered another explanation: numerology. She informed Gemmell afterward that she won the 800 freestyle at the London Olympics on Aug. 3, 2012, and set her first world record in the 800 at the 2013 world championships on Aug. 3. Monday was another Aug. 3 -- and she was in the third heat to boot.Ledecky's world record was the first of three set on the second day of the meet. In the evening session, Sarah Sjostrom of Sweden lowered her day-old mark in the 100 butterfly by a hundredth of a second, winning in 55.64 seconds. Katinka Hosszu of Hungary broke the longest-standing individual women's world record with a 2:06.12 in the 200 individual medley. She surpassed the American Ariana Kukors's 2:06.15, recorded in 2009 in a suit that has since been outlawed.The women's 1,500 final is Tuesday, and Ledecky hopes it will serve as a similarly sublime warm-up for the 200-meter freestyle semifinals that will follow roughly 20 minutes later. The 200 freestyle has a marquee field that includes the defending champion -- and Ledecky's teammate -- Missy Franklin.Franklin, who left the pool before Ledecky's race to rest for her 100-meter backstroke semifinal, was eating lunch when she heard about the record. ""Katie's so special in that some people might almost get used to breaking a world record every time they swim,"" Franklin said. ""But I feel like she really, really appreciates it, but she also doesn't do it for the world record. She's just going out there and trying to be her best, and that just happens to be a world record.""It must be a sinking feeling for Ledecky's rivals, many of whom are accustomed to setting the pace and swimming from ahead, to be falling farther and farther behind. How do they relax and be their best when they are getting lapped on a world stage? Before she was done, Ledecky had lapped the swimmers in Lanes 1, 8 and 9. The competitor in Lane 1 happened to be her teammate Katy Campbell, a U.C.L.A. standout who won the national title in the 1,500 free last summer after Ledecky scratched.Campbell, who finished 1 minute 12 seconds behind Ledecky, said, ""I mean, it's tough racing her, but you know you're racing the best, and you know that if you can get close to her, you are probably one of the best, too.""In 2004, a talented 19-year-old American entered the men's 1,500 at the Olympic trials and produced a top-eight time. He was Ryan Lochte, who has gone on to win 11 Olympic medals at much shorter distances.Asked Monday if he could remember his time, Lochte said, ""A 15:22?""It was a 15:28.37. Lochte sighed. ""Ledecky beat me,"" he said. ""Nice.""He added: ""She's one of the best distance freestylers I've ever seen. I trained with her in Colorado once, and she made me look like I was stopping. She flew by me.""Somewhere, someone is going to pay close attention whenever Ledecky races.""There's some 13-year-old out there right now,"" Lochte said, ""who looks at Katie and says: 'I can do that. I can beat her.' They're full of energy and naïve enough and full of hope and everything else, and it'll happen.""Photograph Top, Katie Ledecky, 18, On Her Way to Setting a World Record Monday at the World Championships.

Sun Besieges an Iraq With Few Ways to Fight Back:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BAGHDAD -- At noon, the light bouncing off the hot concrete seems to bleach everything, like an overexposed photograph. Standing for more than a minute in the sun sets off a full-body sweat.Even after sunset, as the temperature coasts down from 122 degrees Fahrenheit, or 50 degrees Celsius, to perhaps 108, Baghdad's heat can seem like a living thing. It clings to every contour of the body, squeezing tight.Iraq has been hot even by its own standards. Taking all conditions into account, the Weather Channel calculated that the peak day in Baghdad this summer felt like 159 degrees. It was a data point most likely of little use to outsiders unable to imagine even 122 degrees, and of little comfort to Iraqis living in it.They have taken to the streets all around the country, protesting in central squares and blaming government corruption for the chronic electricity shortages that shut down air coolers and fans all but a few hours a day. In Samawa, south of Baghdad, protesters surrounded the governor's house on Sunday evening and demanded that he resign.Perhaps recalling that Iraqis have overthrown two governments in midsummer, in 1958 and 1968, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has warned that without quick fixes, the government will face ""revolutionary sentiments.""But any insurrectionary impulse must overcome a competing instinct to surrender to the heat. Iraqis refer to this month as ""blazing August"" -- it rhymes in Arabic, ""ab al-lahab"" -- and they spend it doing as little as possible. Much of what they do do is find ways to cool down.On and around Rasheed Street in central Baghdad on Saturday afternoon, the few who ventured out on foot stuck to shaded sidewalks under the pillared arcades of weathered Ottoman buildings.People darted onto the white-hot street only to dodge obstacles, like a stuck donkey cart, a line of shoppers waiting to buy four-foot-long blocks of ice, or a fully clothed man taking a shower.The shower head, sprinkling lukewarm water that felt practically icy in the baking shade, was rigged up outside a cellphone shop belonging to Ziad Abdelhalim. He had set it up as an act of charity, but also as a lure for customers, not unlike frigidly air-conditioned New York City shops that leave their doors open to waft enticingly cool gusts onto the sidewalk.""Clients pass by just to use it,"" said Mr. Abdelhalim, 42, wet from dunking his own head in the stream. He said it was especially popular during Ramadan, which fell in June and July this year. The holy month's daily fast prohibits the observant from drinking water all day, but not from splashing in it.""We have two rivers -- lots of water,"" he said, gesturing toward the Tigris, a couple of blocks away, and the Euphrates farther west.In fact, the rivers that made Mesopotamia the cradle of civilization are threatened by drought and upstream water disputes. Yet water bills are so low that the cost is negligible for Iraqis, who in times like these often resort to taking three or four showers a day.That is, if they are lucky. If their pipes and water tanks are in the sun, then their tap water is, as one Iraqi put it, ""a mixture of hot and boiling hot.""Not far from Mr. Abdelhalim's shower, there was a solution. A merchant took industrial-size rods of ice from a freezer and sawed them to order. Some customers planned to put them in their water tanks to make showers bearable. Others said they would use the ice for drinks, or simply sit around a big block of it, the way they huddle in winter by kerosene heaters.A few doors down, water spattered on the sidewalk. A little girl in a pink tank top, shorts and glittering gold sandals was pouring it from a tin cup onto her chest. Then she slumped lazily against her father, Haytham Qahtan.He sat at a small wooden table outside a food shop and stroked her arm, which glistened with sweat. On offer was traditional food that Iraqis eat even in summer: boiled sheep's heads on enormous platters of rice, with hot tea.Mr. Qahtan, 36, makes a living driving a motorized rickshaw, its open cab only partly shaded. Recently, he said, he got stuck in a traffic jam, boiling in the sun, only to have his vehicle break down. He ended up having to pay a traffic ticket worth more than his day's wages.The money is critical. He pays $100 a month for generator power when the state grid is down, which lately is all but five or six hours a day.Not all Iraqis can treat themselves to a generator, and most of those, like Mr. Qahtan, can afford enough electricity to sustain only one simple fan or air cooler, which cools through the evaporation of water. Real air-conditioning is out of the question. And because Mr. Qahtan has only a small apartment, not a house, his family cannot resort to the centuries-old Iraqi summertime habit of sleeping on the roof.After weeks of this, he said, he is on edge, chain-smoking and drinking tea to stay calm. Every day, he joked, he drinks 32 cups. But he still finds himself getting enraged at his family for small things -- like the day before, when his daughter, Malak, 6, flipped on one too many switches for the generator to handle. The power went out, the repairman had to be called, and Mr. Qahtan blew up.""I lost my mind,"" he said.The heat, of course, is not new to Iraqis. In the Iraqi novel ""The Palm Tree and the Neighbors,"" one character declares that his countrymen have no fear of hell because ""we are so used to it.""What is relatively new is the modernization and war that in a couple of generations have turned a city of low houses and brick-walled gardens into an expanse of concrete-block apartments and concrete blast walls, requiring artificial cooling from an unreliable electrical grid.Overhead on Rasheed Street, spider webs of spaghetti-like wires testified to decades of electrical improvisation. Long rickety from years of sanctions and mismanagement, the power grid was gutted after the United States invaded in 2003 and failed to prevent the looting of infrastructure. Insurgent attacks, which have not stopped since, continue to do damage.""The invasion took Iraq back 20 or 30 years,"" Mr. Abdelhalim said, adding that the current government was little better than American occupation.""This government will not be moved by protests,"" he said. ""Only by force.""Photograph The Ruins of an Old Building Served As a Platform for Children to Jump Into the Tigris River in Baghdad and Cool Off Last Month.

Court Says Governor's Vetoes Came Too Late,,"Dozens of bills opposed by Gov. Paul LePage have become law because he misinterpreted the Maine Constitution and did not veto them in time, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court said Thursday. The court unanimously sided with legislative leaders in their fierce dispute with the Republican governor, saying that lawmakers' temporary adjournment in June did not prevent him from returning the vetoed bills to the chambers. Mr. LePage had argued that the Legislature's adjournment meant that the usual 10-day limit he is given to sign or veto bills did not apply. After the decision, he said he was thankful the justices resolved the issue and looks forward to moving on. Lawmakers hailed the ruling and called on Mr. LePage to enforce the laws, which include one that he vehemently opposed that would allow immigrants seeking asylum in Maine to receive municipal welfare benefits. There likely was not enough support in the Legislature to overturn that veto and the measure likely would have died if the governor had vetoed it on time. Mr. LePage went to the court last month after lawmakers refused to take up the 65 veto messages that his staff members hand-delivered to lawmakers on their final day of session for the year. Other measures that are now law include a measure that would expand access to an anti-overdose antidote and one that would provide insurance coverage for reproductive services for more women.",0.0

Secret Service Deputy Demoted as Panel Chairman Presses for Firing:   [National Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- Senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security on Monday demoted the deputy director of the Secret Service, amid criticism from the agency's most ardent critic on Capitol Hill.Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, who is the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, had said the deputy director, A. T. Smith, should be dismissed. Mr. Chaffetz said Mr. Smith had been part of the agency's string of mishaps and scandals.Last week, Mr. Chaffetz announced that Mr. Smith and the agency's interim director, Joseph P. Clancy, had been summoned to testify together at a hearing before the committee.It was made clear to officials at the Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security that Mr. Chaffetz did not plan to go lightly on Mr. Smith. Among other episodes, Mr. Chaffetz was likely to question Mr. Smith about his decision in 2011 to have Secret Service agents conduct welfare checks for five days on an agency employee who said she was threatened by neighbors.It was not clear how Mr. Chaffetz intended to treat Mr. Clancy, although Mr. Chaffetz has said the agency's next director should not come from within the agency -- a blow to Mr. Clancy's candidacy for the job.Shortly after the Secret Service announced that Mr. Smith had stepped down and taken a job at the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Chaffetz and the committee's ranking Democratic member, Elijah E.

Case Against a South African Opposition Leader Is Dismissed:   [Foreign Desk ],,"JOHANNESBURG -- A South African court dismissed a long-running corruption case against the opposition leader Julius Malema on Tuesday, handing a victory to one of President Jacob G. Zuma's most strident critics.The High Court in Polokwane, in Mr. Malema's home province of Limpopo, threw out the charges because of excessive delays in trying the case, which began three years ago. State prosecutors asked on Monday for another postponement because a co-defendant was ill.""Starting from 2012 up to 2015 is too long a time for any person to have a sword hanging over his head, and I'm not willing to subject the accused to that particular ordeal once more,"" Judge George Mothle said in dismissing the case.State prosecutors could still decide to refile charges, which relate to a $4.1 million road construction contract awarded to a company with ties to Mr. Malema, the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters, the country's second-largest opposition party. Members of the group, who dress in red berets and jackets, aggressively attack Mr. Zuma and the governing African National Congress in Parliament.The court did not acquit Mr. Malema, nor did it delve into the details of the charges that he improperly profited from the contract. Critics have said the case was politically motivated.The decision on Tuesday was an embarrassment for Mr. Zuma and the governing party, which have been locked in a political duel with Mr. Malema for years. Mr. Malema, a charismatic leader, was once the head of the A.N.C.'s youth wing and a strong backer of Mr. Zuma, but he was given to provocative actions like publicly singing a song called ""Shoot the Boer"" that a South African court banned as hate speech.He was expelled from the A.N.C. in 2012, and he resurrected his political career the following year by forming his new party, which calls for the nationalization of land and draws strong support from South Africa's impoverished and disaffected youth.Outside the courthouse, Mr. Malema told reporters that prosecutors ""want postponement after postponement, so that I become a citizen in South Africa with a permanent dark cloud over my head.""Mr. Malema said that he was looking forward to appearing in Parliament later this week. He has been among the most tenacious and vocal critics of Mr. Zuma's spending practices, including tens of millions of dollars of public money spent on improvements to his private homestead, Nkandla. Mr. Zuma has rejected calls by the public and the country's public protector for him to repay some of the money.""On Thursday, I will be in Parliament,"" Mr. Malema said. ""Zuma will know us better because we are free.""Mr. Malema, who has described himself as the voice of the poor, has long been dogged by questions about his lavish lifestyle, including expensive houses, cars and clothing. He has defended his ostentation by saying that he cannot inspire the poor by living in a shack.In the national elections last year, Mr. Malema's party won just over 6 percent of the vote, placing a distant third behind the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, which won 22 percent, and the A.N.C., with 62 percent.But because of Mr. Malema's high profile, his party has outsize influence in South African political discourse, and that influence may increase with Tuesday's ruling.""Politically, this is good for Malema and the E.F.F. because it does reinforce the perception that our prosecuting authorities did not go to court with a watertight case, but did so in support of a political agenda,"" said Aubrey Matshiqi, a political analyst at the Helen Suzman Foundation, a private pro-democracy group in South Africa. ""It would have been deeply satisfying for the president, I assume, to see Malema in a yellow or orange uniform.""Mr. Matshiqi said that Mr. Malema would now ""become even more bullish"" in trying to paint Mr. Zuma as personally corrupt and the A.N.C. as a corrupt party unmoored from its past as a defender of the black masses. That perception, already widespread in South Africa, could hurt the A.N.C. in municipal elections next year, he said.With the governing party's popularity already declining in recent elections, Mr. Matshiqi said, ""Malema's actions from this point onward may deepen that image crisis for the A.N.C.""Photograph Julius Malema Arriving in Court in Polokwane, South Africa, On Monday.

Kenyan Runners Accuse Officials of Stealing From Sponsorship Deal:   [Foreign Desk ],,"NAIROBI, Kenya -- Kenya's corruption is now so bad that it has sucked in some of the country's greatest heroes: its fleet-footed runners.On Monday, dozens of world-class athletes stormed the headquarters of the national athletics association here, accusing top officials of stealing money from a Nike deal and demanding that they resign.""These guys have eaten so much,"" said Julius Ndegwa, a spokesman for the runners, using the Kenyan term ""to eat"" to refer to official stealing. ""Enough is enough.""Mr. Ndegwa said that more than 70 runners were planning to spend the night in front of the offices to make sure the officials could not get inside. He called on well-wishers to bring food, water and blankets so they could extend their siege.The International Association of Athletics Federations announced this month that its ethics commission was looking into allegations that officials from Athletics Kenya, Kenya's governing body for athletics, skimmed nearly $700,000 from a multimillion-dollar sponsorship deal with Nike.Kenyan detectives are also investigating the allegations. The officials have denied them, and on Monday, David Okeyo, the association's vice president, who has been accused of stealing money from the Nike deal, did not return several phone calls and text messages.""We are cooperating with the local authorities in their investigation,"" Nike said in a statement. ""Nike conducts business with integrity and expects that our partners do the same.""Kenya is in the midst of an outburst of corruption revelations. Almost every week it is something else, something big, something the public cannot believe.A few weeks ago, a parliamentary committee was given a document that was intended to explain what happened to several million dollars that went missing from one ministry. On that document, officials said they spent $85 for simple ballpoint pens -- $85 each, that is.Soon after, a new report by a Kenyan watchdog group was released, accusing Kenyan generals of running a smuggling ring in neighboring Somalia, where the army is supposed to be battling Islamist militants. The fight against the militants along the Kenyan border has more or less stalled; according to the report, Kenyan generals have made millions smuggling sugar.Now this. Year after year, Kenya's runners are considered some of the best in the world. The man and woman who won this year's New York City Marathon were both Kenyan. In a society rived by political and ethnic rivalries, the runners' success is a source of great national pride.But many of Kenya's best athletes remain poor, and not so long ago some carried around their prize winnings in cash in their backpacks months after they won because they did not feel comfortable putting the money in a bank. Many of the runners, despite being famous, continue to live in marginalized parts of Kenya.On Monday, the runners hoisted signs that reflected the broad anger toward corruption shared by many Kenyans.""Enough is Enough for Blood Sucers,"" said one, its spelling showing the limited education some of the runners have received.""Your time is over,"" said another.",0.0
Widow of a Former South Korean President Pays a Visit to the North:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- The 92-year-old widow of Kim Dae-jung, the South Korean president who championed political reconciliation with North Korea, arrived in Pyongyang, the North's capital, on Wednesday amid cautious hopes that her trip might help thaw relations between the two countries.Lee Hee-ho, the former first lady, was not carrying any official proposal on behalf of the South Korean government, and her delegation did not include a current government official from Seoul. The publicized itinerary of her four-day trip included visits to a children's hospital, orphanage and maternity clinic but no formal meetings with senior North Korean officials.But given her status, analysts monitoring her trip wondered whether the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, would meet her or even send a message to the South through her. Initially, the North's official Korean Central News Agency reported only her arrival in Pyongyang.Ms. Lee's delegation took a chartered plane that made a rare trip across the border of the two Koreas, along the Korean Peninsula's western coast.During his presidency, Kim Dae-jung, a respected figure among liberal South Koreans who generally supported engagement with the North, flew to Pyongyang in 2000 and hugged the current leader's father, Kim Jong-il, in the first inter-Korean summit meeting. He was awarded that year's Nobel Peace Prize for bringing a rapprochement to the divided peninsula.His ""Sunshine Policy,"" which included generous aid shipments for the North and a flurry of inter-Korean projects, like tearful reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War, continued through the administration of his liberal successor, Roh Moo-hyun. Mr. Roh met Kim Jong-il for a second summit meeting in 2007.The policy crumbled when South Koreans voted for conservative leadership that began with the inauguration of President Lee Myung-bak in 2008 and has continued under the incumbent president, Park Geun-hye. Both Mr. Lee and Ms. Park criticized the ""Sunshine Policy"" as coddling the North and allowing its nuclear weapons program to proceed.North Korea retreated into belligerent isolation, cutting off humanitarian exchanges with the South and conducting nuclear and long-range missile tests, as well as shelling a South Korean island in 2010. Efforts to improve relations since then have made little progress, as the mutual mistrust has remained deep.Ms. Lee ""hopes that her visit opens the way for more dialogues, exchanges and cooperation,"" Kim Sung-jae, a former South Korean culture minister who is part of her delegation, told reporters in Seoul before boarding the flight to Pyongyang on Wednesday.",0.0
Uncertain Journeys:   [Op-Ed ],,"AFTER the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, our resolve to help refugees should be stronger than ever. As we express our anger and grief, we must remember that they are fleeing precisely the type of violence that France experienced that night. Rather than turning them away, the United States and Europe need to fully commit to managing their safe passage, screening and settlement, and not leave it up to the ragtag teams of volunteers who have so far been stepping in where governments and agencies have failed.I recently spent three weeks photographing the refugee crisis in Greece, the Balkans and Germany, on assignment for Unicef. On the rocky shores of the Greek island of Lesbos, people scrambled out of their boats, welcomed by an ad hoc group of dedicated and passionate volunteers. Almost 700,000 refugees have arrived in the country this year after making the dangerous passage by sea from Turkey.Governments and NGOs generally have sophisticated systems in place to manage the flow of people in emergency situations in developing countries. But I came across only occasional interventions by organized agencies.The volunteers, many on vacation from throughout Europe and the United States, were filling the gaps. Some of them had medical training; a group of Spanish lifeguards patrolled the coast, diving into the frigid waters to rescue people; some handed out sandwiches they were making all day; and others distributed warm, dry clothes collected from towns and suburbs back home.""Welcome to Europe!"" they called out, hugging relieved refugees. There were many tears. Children, then parents, were wrapped in metallic space blankets. They were given medical assistance and provided with information about the next steps in their passage.Their welcome is some of the only warmth in a cold and arduous journey. Men, women, children, the disabled, the elderly -- no matter -- they're all packed one on top of the other into crowded train cars; screamed at in foreign languages; marched to buses by platoons of cops in full riot gear; kept in lines or clear of border fences by police officers using tear gas and batons; forced to wait for days at a time in filthy, backed-up transit centers; and generally treated like undesirables, or worse, like criminals.I expected the scenes of grief, trauma and desperation. I was surprised to find the many moments of relief, even joy, as the refugees built bonds and passed through hardship together. It is crucial that we bear witness to all of these aspects of the story.I believe, as members of the public, we need to act as the watchdogs of governments and local authorities. We have to demand that policy makers provide systematic humanitarian assistance and not leave it solely up to volunteers to do the work.We should be pressuring governments to treat the refugees as members of their own families. And everybody could be donating clothes, money or even our vacation time to receive them where they arrive.We should not let that terrible night in Paris diminish our sense of humanity and responsibility. Let's remember that the society that we are so protective of is built on the will of refugees -- our own families and the families making the frightening journey today -- with the hope of providing a better life for our children.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.AuthorAffiliation ASHLEY GILBERTSON Ashley Gilbertson is an Australian photographer and director living in New York City.

Searching For Richard Nixon:   Commentary,,"IT'S a truth universally accepted that every Republican who runs for president wants to be Ronald Reagan, and that every Democrat wants to be either Franklin Roosevelt or (God help us) John F. Kennedy.It's also a truth universally accepted that nobody ever, ever wants to be Richard Nixon.But there are times, and this might be one of them, when the country needs a little Nixon. The country and maybe especially the Republican Party, which has been trying to forget its debt to Tricky Dick ever since the helicopter carried him away.I don't mean that what we need now is a resentful paranoiac who makes enemies lists, imposes price controls, bombs countries illegally and resigns after covering up his henchmen's third-rate burglary. And if we did -- well, except for the eventual resignation (""only losers resign""), that much Donald Trump can probably deliver.Rather, it's the gifts that made Nixon successful before his flaws caught up with him that seem well-suited to the current moment.First, Nixon knew how to channel an angry, ""who's looking out for me?"" populism without letting himself be imprisoned by its excesses. A similar anger has propelled Trump, but as David Frum has pointed out, for all of the Donald's ""silent majority"" call-outs he's clearly more a George Wallace than a Nixon. Some of the anxieties he's exploited are legitimate, just as the crime wave that Wallace fixated on really was a clear and pressing problem. But like Wallace, Trump is a provocateur and bigot -- or a provocateur playing a bigot -- with a deserved ceiling on his support.The problem for Republicans is that they haven't found a candidate who can appeal to Trump's politically-disaffected supporters -- whether they're worried about immigration, jobs, terrorism or an overreaching social liberalism -- without trafficking in slurs and empty bluster. But that's roughly what Nixon did in 1968 and 1972, when he addressed (liberal historians would say exploited, but we can have that debate another time) widespread anxieties over social change and disorder without ever repudiating racial equality or civil rights.In this year's Republican primary, the non-Trump candidates have struggled mightily to make that kind of nuanced case. And they've struggled, in part, because they lack a second Nixonian gift: An instinct for the non-ideological character of many American voters, primary voters included.Nixon was a conservative and an opportunist in equal measure: leftward of Barry Goldwater, rightward of Nelson Rockefeller, and basically wherever the voters he was courting needed him to be. Whereas today's Republican politicians are used to campaigning on a list of Reaganite commandments, and often seem baffled when the conversation leaves their comfort zone.As it clearly has, again thanks in part to Trump, at various points throughout this campaign -- and that's just in a primary! In the general election and in a hypothetical administration, the Republican nominee will be confronting a political landscape calculated to frustrate any sweeping ideological design.On the one hand, we have groaning entitlement programs (Obamacare now included) in desperate need of some reform; on the other, we have a stagnant economy and a hard-pressed electorate that fears any fraying of the safety net. No president can deal with that combination without a Nixonian level of ideological flexibility -- which is to say, more than President Obama has shown, and more than the demands of Republican orthodoxy allow.Then on foreign policy, too, a dose of Nixon's cold-eyed view of world affairs would dramatically improve what Republicans are currently promising. Obama's foreign policy is, put charitably, a stumbling mess. But the Republican pretense that all we need to do is name our enemies and crush them misses the deep complexity of America's challenges.We don't face a single Soviet-style threat or a convenient ""axis"" of allied evils. We can't defeat ISIS and contain Iran and push back Russia and restrain China all at once. So we need a president who can see the strategic chessboard whole, who can instill fear in our rivals but also negotiate boldly in situations where opportunity presents itself. And that sounds much closer to Nixonian realpolitik than it does to the full-spectrum hawkishness most Republicans are running on.The odd truth is that the most Nixon-like candidate in 2016 -- in the sense of being ideologically protean and personally ruthless, at least -- might be the one waiting for Republicans in the fall.But the unfortunate reality for the country is that Hillary Clinton might offer Nixon's weaknesses without his strengths: All the seaminess and paranoia, but none of the actual achievements. (Neither the Russian ""reset"" not the Libya victory-turned-fiasco was exactly the equivalent of the opening to China.)Which makes her vulnerable. But only if her Republican rivals realize that there's a better way to be Nixonian, and that in 2016, it might be the winning way as well.I invite you to follow me on Twitter at twitter.com/DouthatNYT.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",0.0
"Seymour Lipkin, 88, Pianist and Conductor:   [Obituary (Obit); Biography ]",,"Seymour Lipkin, a pianist and conductor widely admired in both roles for his acute, deliberately unflashy musicianship, died on Nov. 16 in Blue Hill, Me. He was 88.His wife, Ellen Werner, confirmed his death.Mr. Lipkin came to wide public attention in 1948 when, at 20, he won first prize in the Rachmaninoff Fund Piano Contest, a nationwide competition held in New York. He went on to play on the world's foremost recital stages and with the world's most eminent orchestras.He interrupted that career for a life of conducting in the 1970s and '80s, returning to the piano in the '90s for a critically acclaimed second act. He was also a longtime faculty member of the Juilliard School in New York and the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.As both pianist and conductor, reviewers agreed, Mr. Lipkin made music with a conspicuous absence of the dazzle, bathos and schmaltz that are the stock in trade of many instrumentalists.""There is no blurring in Lipkin's approach,"" The Boston Globe wrote in 1996, reviewing a Beethoven recital. ""The pianist plays with the structural clarity of an architect's drawing; the drama comes from the interplay of musical ideas, not from emotional displays.""Throughout his work, Mr. Lipkin was praised by critics for his keen sensitivity -- a ""moral responsibility,"" he called it -- to the composer's intent; his sculptural finesse in shaping a musical line; and his vast knowledge of the musical literature. He was often described as a Beethoven specialist, but his pianistic compass ranged from the Baroque era to the present day.Underpinning Mr. Lipkin's music-making was his intense sense of communion with the works he performed. That communion was often rooted in deeply personal dialogues he held with the composers -- exchanges that required only Mr. Lipkin to be present.In an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2012, he recounted one especially productive conversation:",0.0

Conventional Wisdom Clashes With Data on Health Care Savings:   [National Desk ],,"In 2014, an estimated nine million people became newly insured thanks to Obamacare.There's an oft-expressed view that getting all those people covered could actually save the health system money. The argument goes something like this: Once people have insurance, they'll go to the doctor instead of an expensive emergency room. Or: Prevention costs far less than a serious illness down the road.In selling the Affordable Care Act, President Obama was fond of making these sorts of arguments. ""There's no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse,"" he said, in his big 2009 address to Congress, urging passage of the bill. ""That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives."" The White House was careful to describe the overall financial forecast for the law -- the administration said the law would slow spending growth and not reverse it. But it has also argued forcefully and repeatedly about the financial value of preventive care.This argument for the cost savings from universal health coverage makes some intuitive sense, but it's wrong. There's strong evidence from a variety of sources that people who have health insurance spend more on medical care than people who don't. It also turns out that almost all preventive health care costs more than it saves. Those facts don't mean that giving people health insurance is a waste of money, since those dollars spent may improve their health and financial security. But there are only a few situations in which giving someone more health care will actually end up saving money.Last week, the government actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services published their annual report on what it expects the nation to spend on health care over the next 10 years. Because of a long time lag in data collection, the actuaries still don't have hard numbers on health spending in 2014, when millions of people first got insurance.But, based on available information, the actuaries estimated that health spending that year jumped by 5.5 percent, a bigger rise than the country had experienced in five years. That's actually not a huge increase by historical standards -- average increases in health spending for the 30 years before the recent Great Recession were 9 percent a year. But it still marks the end of an era of record-low spending growth in the system. The slowdown seems to be over.The actuaries cited three main reasons they think health spending is set to tick up. One is the aging of the population; people tend to get sicker as they age. Another is the improving economy, which will enable more people to afford medical care -- or the time off from work it might take to attend to their health needs. But the third, and a big one, was Obamacare's coverage expansion.There's evidence about the link between insurance status and health spending from many sources. A famous randomized study of health insurance, started in the 1970s by the RAND Corporation, was designed to answer this exact question. It found that the less expensive you made it for people to obtain medical care, the more of it they used. That follows the pattern for nearly every other good in the economy, including food, clothing and electronics. The cheaper they are for people, the more they are likely to buy.That finding was echoed recently by researchers who conducted another randomized controlled trial -- this one of uninsured low-income people in Oregon. Low-income Oregonians who wanted to sign up for the state's Medicaid program were placed in a lottery. Only some got the insurance, but the researchers tracked both groups. In the first year, they found that the lottery entrants who were given Medicaid spent more on health care than those who remained uninsured.Amy Finkelstein, a professor of economics at M.I.T. and one of the authors of the Oregon study, described this finding as their least surprising result. ""There's overwhelming evidence from our study and others that when you cover people with health insurance, they use more health care,"" she said.But what about prevention? In certain situations, early spending on someone's health will stop an expensive disease in its tracks, reducing future spending. Giving people health insurance often enables them to get just this sort of preventive care -- and Obamacare requires insurers to offer most preventive services without charging any co-payments. You might expect health spending to jump initially, then slow in future years as people benefit from new prevention. But research shows that even preventive care rarely ends up saving money.Here's why: For the individual patient whose heart attack is prevented by a cholesterol screening, to give one example, that blood test is a cost-saver. But to prevent one heart attack, the health care system has to test hundreds of healthy people -- and give about a hundred of them cholesterol-lowering drugs for at least five years. Added together, those prevention measures cost more than is saved on the one heart attack treatment. (My colleagues Aaron E. Carroll and Austin Frakt have written a helpful article on this concept, known in medicine as the ""number needed to treat."")Joshua T. Cohen, the deputy director of the Center for Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at Tufts Medical Center, said: ""We've all heard it before: 'An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.' It doesn't really play out when you analyze the numbers, and the reason for that is that you have to give a lot of people those ounces of prevention to end up with one person who's going to get that pound of cure.""There's also the unavoidable fact that every time you prevent people from dying from one disease, they are likely to live longer and incur future medical expenses. The patient who benefits from the cholesterol screening may go on to develop cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's or some other costly illness.There are some prevention measures that actually do seem to save money. Counseling on contraception is one because the costs of prenatal care, delivery and pediatric care associated with an unplanned pregnancy are so substantial. But a lot of the preventive health measures that we tend to value a lot -- mammography, screening for diabetes -- tend to cost more than they save. Researchers like Mr. Cohen, who study these trade-offs, say we need to think more broadly about the value of what our preventive spending buys, not the narrow question of whether it saves money.That may be one way of thinking about the law's benefits for the newly insured, who had limited access to the health care system. For many, their new coverage means they can get free checkups and preventive disease screenings, and can more easily pay for big health care needs, like prescription drugs and operations. Early evidence suggests they are facing less financial stress as a result of their coverage.Some are now managing chronic and potentially life-threatening health conditions. But those benefits don't mean we should be surprised by the actuaries' recent findings on spending growth. More people in the health care system means more dollars spent on health care. The increase doesn't mean that Obamacare is leading to runaway costs, or that it's failing to reform the health care system to make it more efficient. But it does mean that we can't think of the coverage expansion as free.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter.

Vatican Starts Trial in Leaks to Journalists:   [Foreign Desk ],,"VATICAN CITY -- Five people, including two Italian journalists, went on trial in a Vatican courtroom on Tuesday on charges of illegally procuring and circulating confidential documents that were used to write two tell-all books detailing suspected mismanagement and corruption at the Vatican.The Vatican claims that by taking the documents, the defendants violated the ""fundamental interests of the Holy See and the State,"" language it used in a formal indictment issued on Saturday. The two journalists counter that the Vatican is violating their right to freedom of the press.""We are not martyrs, we are investigative journalists, and some principles must be defended,"" one of the defendants, Gianluigi Nuzzi, the author of ""Merchants in the Temple,"" told the small pool of reporters allowed into the Vatican courtroom on Tuesday. ""We just did our job.""The defendants face up to eight years in prison.""Journalists should be allowed to carry out their role as watchdog and investigate alleged wrongdoing without fear of repercussions,"" Nina Ognianova, Europe and Central Asia Coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said in a statement on Monday.The two books were published this month. They offer detailed evidence of mismanagement, greed and financial irregularities in the Vatican and chronicle the difficulties that Pope Francis has faced in trying to push through reforms to remedy the problems.Three other three defendants -- Francesca Chaouqui, a public-relations consultant; Msgr. Lucio Ángel Vallejo Balda; and Monsignor Vallejo Balda's assistant, Nicola Maio -- were members of a now-defunct commission set up by Pope Francis to help draft changes for the Vatican's financial dealings. Vatican prosecutors say that the three of them provided some of the documents and information that ended up in the two books.All five defendants were in court on Tuesday.As the proceedings began, Mr. Fittipaldi read a statement to the four-judge court, formally challenging its right to put him on trial. He pointed out that in Italy, the right to publish news -- as long as it is truthful and not defamatory -- is guaranteed by the Constitution as well as the European Convention on Human Rights.Lawyers for the defendants said that with the formal indictment filed only on Saturday, they did not have sufficient time to prepare for the case.Roberto Zannotti, an assistant prosecutor for the Vatican, countered that the court was not challenging freedom of the press, but rather how the information was obtained.After deliberating for 45 minutes, the judges rejected Mr. Fittipaldi's motion to dismiss the charges against him, and adjourned the court until Monday.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"A Maryland Town Fires Its Black P olice Chief, Exposing a Racial Rift:   [National Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDED. POCOMOKE CITY, Md. -- Kelvin Sewell figured he had landed his dream job in 2010, when he retired as a Baltimore police officer to help run the tiny 16-member force in this little riverfront city, which calls itself ""the friendliest town on the Eastern Shore."" A year later he became its first African-American police chief.Blacks and whites have coexisted, sometimes uneasily, in Pocomoke for centuries, but Chief Sewell, with his easygoing manner, quickly fit in. He prodded officers to patrol on foot, pleasing business owners. He helped poor students fill out college applications. Crime, everyone agrees, went down on his watch.But the chief's abrupt dismissal in June, without explanation, by a white mayor and majority white City Council that voted along racial lines, has torn Pocomoke asunder, wrecking old friendships and exposing a deep racial rift in this community of roughly 4,100 people, split almost evenly between black and white.The drama in Pocomoke is a tiny slice of America's searing national conversation about race, playing out largely in big cities like Baltimore, St. Louis and most recently, Cincinnati, around police mistreatment of African-Americans. A recent New York Times/CBS News Poll found nearly six in 10 Americans, including majorities of blacks and whites, think race relations are generally bad, and nearly four in 10 think they are getting worse.What makes Pocomoke unusual is the way that conversation is tearing apart a small town, forcing lifelong friends and neighbors to confront how differently they see the world. A black minister who went to high school with the white mayor -- and worked to elect him -- is pushing for his ouster. A white city councilman provoked gasps by addressing black citizens as ""you people.""""There is so much history here, with everybody being raised here -- except the chief,"" said Monna VanEss, 53, the former city finance director, who is white. ""A lot of these people on both sides went to school together and have known each other all their lives. We've never been this divided.""Mr. Sewell, 53, says his firing was ""racially motivated"" punishment for standing up for two black officers who experienced harassment. (Before his dismissal, his lawyer said, he had also filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that he was paid less than his white predecessor.) Black residents, led by two prominent African-American ministers, have demanded the chief's reinstatement -- they say they have more than 500 signatures on a petition -- and the resignation of Mayor Bruce Morrison.Blacks are also organizing politically, accusing the city -- with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland -- of voting rights irregularities involving the cancellation of a municipal election, which cleared the way for a white city councilman to take office in April with no opposition in a majority black district. The situation is so tense that the Justice Department recently sent mediators to hear black residents' concerns.""This is political and racial,"" said the Rev. James Jones, an associate pastor at the New Macedonia Baptist Church and the mayor's former classmate. He says African-Americans were so furious about the chief's firing he feared Pocomoke would break out into a riot. ""The political structure of Pocomoke, they are not ready for a black chief. They don't like us at the top.""Not so, insists Mayor Morrison, who said the chief's dismissal is a personnel matter, which he cannot discuss. He has no intention of quitting. ""I've never been called a racist in my life,"" he said during a brief interview at his desk in Pocomoke's small, brick City Hall. ""And I don't appreciate it.""While some whites are withholding judgment, at least one, Michael Dean, a funeral director and part-time forensic investigator with the state medical examiner's office, has openly criticized the chief. He said he has ""lost respect"" for Mr. Sewell but would not say why. Others seem unable to fathom that race may have played a role.""Nobody knows why he was let go, but there was a reason and it wasn't racial,"" said Marc Scher, who owns a bridal shop downtown. Mr. Scher says the wife of the Rev. Ronnie White, the other black minister pressing for the ouster of the mayor, does seamstress work for him, and the pastor's grandmother was the Scher family's housekeeper when Mr. Scher was a boy.""They're still my friends,"" he said. ""I don't agree with them.""Nestled between the Chesapeake and Chincoteague Bays, and surrounded by corn and soybean fields, Pocomoke City is part of Maryland's lower Eastern Shore, a world away and much poorer than fancy shore communities like St. Michaels, where prominent Washingtonians keep summer homes. Its history of racial tensions runs deep.Resistance to slavery was strong in Maryland, but the lower Eastern Shore, just across the border from Virginia, was home to Confederate sympathizers during the Civil War. The early 20th century brought lynch mobs. The region was slow to desegregate its schools and even slower to elect blacks to government, said Deborah Jeon, legal director for the A.C.L.U. of Maryland, which in the 1990s brought a voting rights case that forced changes in the way Pocomoke's surrounding county, Worcester, held elections.""It's not like the rest of Maryland; it's more like the Deep South,"" Ms. Jeon said. ""They fought us tooth and nail to prevent changes in the election system, even though the county had an all-white government for 250 years.""Poverty is a concern. Pocomoke's per capita income is $19,243, about half that of Maryland as a whole, and 27.1 percent of residents live below the poverty line. The rough side of town, known locally as ""the back burner,"" is overwhelmingly black, with run-down cinder block homes and a reputation for drugs and crime.""Coming to Pocomoke from Baltimore City,"" Mr. Sewell said, ""it feels like you go back in time.""Mr. Sewell's troubles began, both he and his lawyer Andrew McBride said, when a black detective, Franklin L. Savage, complained of racial harassment while assigned to a regional police task force on combating the drug trade.After a string of racially charged incidents -- including receiving a text message addressing him with a racial epithet and being driven by fellow officers down a street they called ""K.K.K. road"" -- Detective Savage asked to go back to his regular work in Pocomoke and complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, said Mr. McBride of the law firm Wiley Rein.But upon his return, Mr. McBride said, Detective Savage faced questions from city officials about his credibility, and wound up on night duty, which he construed as retaliation. Another black Pocomoke officer, Lt. Lynell Green, accompanied Detective Savage to a commission mediation session, and later complained of harassment as well. After that, Mr. McBride said, both officers were branded troublemakers, and city officials began pressuring Chief Sewell to fire them.When he would not, said Mr. McBride -- who is representing all three men with the nonprofit Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs -- the chief was fired. The other two officers remain on the force.William C. Hudson, the Pocomoke City solicitor, said that was not an accurate accounting of events, though like Mayor Morrison he would not offer specifics. ""When all the facts are known,"" he said, ""it will be clear that the city is guilty of no improprieties and that the action taken to relieve Chief Sewell was in the best interest of the community.""Perhaps, but ill will abounds. Diane Downing, the lone member of the City Council to oppose Chief Sewell's removal, said the mayor pushed the council to fire him -- in violation of the city charter, which does not give the mayor hiring or firing authority -- and begged her to vote in favor.""I am not stupid, and I was not born last night,"" she said. ""He wanted my vote because I am black.""The firing has stirred a new spirit of African-American activism. Black residents -- many wearing T-shirts bearing Mr. Sewell's likeness -- jammed the City Council chambers during a tense meeting after his dismissal. Pastor Jones and Pastor White have formed a coalition, Citizens for a Better Pocomoke, to prod blacks to get more involved in city government. Pastor Jones said they will not rest until the chief is back and the mayor is gone.""They woke the sleeping giant,"" said Gabe Purnell, an African-American activist from nearby Berlin, Md., who is advising the group.Whites, too, are organizing. At the Salem United Methodist Church, a white congregation, more than 100 people signed a letter Thursday backing the mayor. Both blacks and whites are bracing for the next City Council meeting, Monday night. A Justice Department spokeswoman said its mediators, who have no authority to investigate, ""remain available"" to ""facilitate any discussions"" if needed.Some wonder if Pocomoke will ever heal. Mayor Morrison insists everything will be fine: ""It's still the friendliest town on the Eastern Shore,"" he said, ""and I'll stick by that.""",0.0
The Price of Fear:   [Editorial ],,"After the attacks in Paris, the world is again challenged by fear. With every bombing, beheading and mass shooting, the dread spreads, along with the urgency of defeating this nihilism.But no less a challenge for the civilized world is the danger of self-inflicted injury. In the reaction and overreaction to terrorism comes the risk that society will lose its way.History is replete with examples of the power of fear and ignorance, to which even the great can fall prey. Franklin Roosevelt calmed a nation in bleakest days of the Depression, but he also signed the executive order imprisoning tens of thousands of American citizens for the crime of Japanese ancestry.In our time, disastrous things have been done in the name of safety: the invasion of Iraq, spawned by delusion and lies; the creation of an offshore fortress, sequestered from the Constitution, to lock up those perceived as threats, no matter the cost and injustice; an ever-expanding surveillance apparatus, to spy on the people, no matter the futility.Al Qaeda and the Islamic State did not compel us to shackle ourselves to a security state, or to disgrace our values by vilifying and fearing refugees and immigrants.This bitter truth is lost on the politicians now grasping for the Republican presidential nomination, whose guiding principle seems to be a crowd-pleasing strain of bullying cowardice. There is Donald Trump, who voiced his support for the registration of American Muslims. Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz think there is something proudly American about imposing a religious test on desperate refugees.As for the members of the House, Democratic and Republican, who voted to effectively shut down the Syrian and Iraqi refugee program, and the governors who would somehow block Syrians from their borders -- Americans should hope it's just fearful ignorance that clouds their vision, and that in time it clears.History will always be kinder to those who are resolute and brave. Like the Japanese-American soldiers of World War II, whose response to injustice was to fight overseas, defending democracy with their lives. Or the leaders today who have been calm in the crisis, willing to see and to say what the mob does not. People like the governor of Washington State, Jay Inslee, who has urged open doors for Syrian refugees, citing the Japanese-American internment as a disastrous precedent. ""We regret that,"" he said. ""We regret that we succumbed to fear.""Terrorist violence is terrifying, and it is natural to want to restore a shattered sense of safety. But the best way to do that has always been to draw upon our greatest ideals.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",0.0
The Hard Problem of Batteries:   Commentary,,"Steve LeVine became interested in batteries in the wake of the financial crisis. LeVine is the Washington correspondent for Quartz, a news site covering the global economy, and he sensed, he told me recently, ""a loss of confidence in the U.S. in our ability to create a real economy"" -- one based not on financial instruments or a real estate boom, but real products that would help create entire new industries.The battery could be such a product. Not just any battery, of course, but a battery designed for electric cars and capable of powering them for 200 miles or even 300 miles per charge. A battery that could compete with -- and eventually replace -- the internal combustion engine and transform the electric car from a niche product to a mass-market automobile.Such a battery does not yet exist. But if such a thing could be invented, it might well develop into a $100 billion-plus market in its first five or six years of existence, according to LeVine. A battery like that could vastly improve energy security. And with so much less exhaust spewed into the air, the effect on climate change could be lowered. The United States is trying to develop such a battery, and so are many other countries.That interest led LeVine to the Argonne National Laboratory, one of the Department of Energy's 17 national labs. For the better part of two years he was given access to its Battery Department, emerging with a captivating book entitled ""The Powerhouse: Inside the Invention of a Battery to Save the World.""With the closure or winnowing of many of corporate America's industrial labs -- not least the famed Bell Labs, which is a shadow of its once-mighty self -- industry now relies heavily on the federal government's national labs for basic scientific research. Thus it was that scientists at Argonne, which is in the Chicago suburbs, discovered a battery chemistry that greatly improved electric car performance, called NMC (for nickel-manganese-cobalt). The Chevrolet Volt uses a version of NMC, as will, reportedly, the next generation of Nissan Leafs. Which also suggests its drawback: the Volt only gets about 40 miles on pure battery power alone before it switches to its gasoline-powered engine.The core of LeVine's book is about the effort to take the next big step: create a battery that can achieve five times that mileage, while still remaining stable -- stability is always a big issue with batteries -- and affordable. The scientists at Argonne -- some of them larger-than-life figures in the battery world -- labeled this effort NMC 2.0. Though the writing can get technical at times, LeVine still tells a rollicking good tale. The scientists make a number of painstaking advances, inching the chemistry forward, only to discover problems. One such problem is called ""voltage fade"" -- an instability that is serious enough to make the battery unusable in an electric vehicle.There is also a private company in LeVine's narrative, a start-up called Envia Systems. Licensing the advances made by Argonne, it claims to have solved the rest of the puzzle. Its executives are persuasive enough that General Motors contracts with them to create the battery for an electric car it is calling, internally, the Bolt, which is supposed to get 200 miles per charge.LeVine told me that, for a long time, he fully expected that his book would end with Envia solving the riddle of NMC 2.0, and having a wildly successful public offering. But that's not what happens. As G.M., Argonne, and LeVine eventually discover, the Envia claims were wildly exaggerated. After G.M. found out that the company wouldn't be able to deliver after all, it ended its contract with the company and looked to LG Chem Ltd., the big South Korean company, to supply the battery.Indeed, by the end of the book, scientists still haven't solved the voltage fade problem, and NMC 2.0 seems as far away as ever. Argonne wins a competition set up by the Department of Energy to create a ""Battery Hub,"" in which more than a dozen national labs, universities and corporate partners will work together to completely rethink their approach to the conceptual leap the government -- and everyone else -- is hoping for. In effect, they're starting over.There is grist in ""The Powerhouse"" for critics of President Obama. He pushed for battery innovation just as he pushed for solar innovation. The latter gave us Solyndra; the former gave us Envia. Financing efforts to invent a new battery is, without question, a form of industrial policy.But LeVine thinks this view is misguided, and so do I. ""France and Germany and China have renewed their push for electric cars,"" he says. ""The stakes are so high and the dividends so rich that they keep going"" -- even if the quest seems, at times, quixotic.Besides, batteries are, as LeVine puts it, ""a hard problem."" If the government won't try to solve that problem, who will?",0.0
"A Sarcastic Critic of Politics and Media, Signing Off:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"On Thursday night 10 presidential candidates will spill onto a stage in Cleveland, and the already crowded Republican primary race will begin in earnest with the first day of debates, live on Fox News.The perfect Jon Stewart moment.But Mr. Stewart won't be around to skewer the participants. A couple of hours earlier, on the Far West Side of Manhattan, he will have already taped his final show.The timing is coincidental, but meaningful: Mr. Stewart has spent his career as host of the ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central having a field day with politicians (many of them Republican), outlandish billionaires (including Donald Trump) and cable news stations (Fox News in particular).Since Mr. Stewart started hosting ""The Daily Show"" 16 years ago, the country's trust in both the news media and the government has plummeted. Mr. Stewart's brand of fake news thrived in that vacuum, and turned him into one of the nation's most bracing cultural, political and media critics.With his over-the-top presentation of the news -- his arms swinging wildly, his eyes bulging with outrage, followed by a shake of the head and a knowing smile -- Mr. Stewart attracted a generation of viewers ready to embrace an outlier whose exaggerations, in their view, carried more truth than conventional newscasts.""He made the position what it was and he was smart and talented enough to imagine what this could be,"" Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, a Democrat and himself a former performer on ""Saturday Night Live,"" said in an interview. ""It evolved very quickly under his leadership and used the format of fake news to talk about everything and anything, and do it brilliantly.""When Mr. Stewart took over Comedy Central's late-night slot, replacing Craig Kilborn, the show was on a little-watched cable network, with around 350,000 viewers a night. That number grew year after year, and at its height, in the 2008-2009 season, it drew 1.6 million viewers a night, many of them young and left-leaning.But Mr. Stewart was far from a universally loved figure. His viewership, though a boon for Comedy Central, was much smaller than that of the network late-night shows. A Pew Research poll said there were nearly as many viewers who distrusted it as those who trusted it, and there was a significant divide among the liberals who craved it and conservatives who loathed it. Critics, even on the left, said he could come off as pompous and self-righteous.Still, the show's relentless focus on political news, and the amount of time Mr. Stewart, who is not granting interviews ahead of his departure, would devote to a certain topic each night, made him an object of fascination, especially among the press.""I think Stewart has it both ways,"" said Jeff Greenfield, the longtime TV news reporter. ""He says he's just a comedian but he's more than a comedian and I think he knows that. I spent three decades-plus doing network news but if you ask me today, what do I pay more attention to, John Oliver and Jon Stewart or the evening newscast, it's not close. I get much more out of Oliver and Stewart when he's cooking than I do out of those formulaic 22-minute newscasts.""""There are a lot of journalists who watch Stewart and envy the freedom he has,"" Mr. Greenfield added. ""You can't go on television when you're a journalist and say, 'Senator X is a bald-faced liar.' ""The show's producers and writers knew they had that in their favor. The show's popularity started to gain steam during the 2000 election, said Madeleine Smithberg, a creator of ""The Daily Show,"" especially in the monthlong drama after the election that led to the Bush v. Gore decision. ""We moved into the forefront in everybody's mind and everyone was watching us because we were the only ones who could call it for what it actually was,"" Ms. Smithberg said.By that point, Mr. Stewart had been host for two years and was zeroing in on the show's identity, a significant departure from his predecessor Mr. Kilborn, who was a former sports anchor.""The show certainly had not found itself by the time Craig had left,"" said Lewis Black, the comedian and longtime ""Daily Show"" contributor who worked with both hosts. ""The pieces were in place but it needed somebody to guide the ship in. Jon really became that person.""As that was happening, ""South Park"" was becoming a hit in its own right, and Comedy Central began to take off.""What Jon did was put us into the national conversation and put us into the zeitgeist and the front page,"" said Doug Herzog, the president of the Viacom Music and Entertainment group.It's a platform that has turned Mr. Stewart's little-known replacement, the 31-year-old Trevor Noah, into an overnight celebrity. And the show has likewise minted many stars, including Stephen Colbert, who is replacing David Letterman next month; John Oliver, who now has his own show on HBO; Steve Carell; Ed Helms; Larry Wilmore; and Samantha Bee.There have been many milestones: Mr. Stewart's coverage of the Bush White House; the show's best-selling book, ""America: A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction""; his confrontations with CNBC's Jim Cramer; and his feuds with Fox News. (Mr. Stewart revisited that topic on the show Monday night, after Fox News accused him of being too cozy with the Obama administration because he had visited the president at the White House.)In 2010, Mr. Stewart and Mr. Colbert organized a gathering that attracted thousands in Washington, called the ""Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear,"" in response to the conservative commentator Glenn Beck and the growing Tea Party movement. That same year, his determined advocacy of a bill to provide aid to 9/11 responders was widely cited as the reason it passed through Congress.There are signs, however, that the show's best days are behind it. It has had a declining audience for three straight years, and its average for total viewers this season is about 1.35 million, its lowest since 2005. The viewership in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic, at 725,000 viewers a night, is at its lowest in 11 years, according to data from Nielsen.Mr. Herzog, of Viacom, took issue with the figures, arguing that including viewers who were watching parts of his show online, ""Jon's probably more impactful than ever.""Mr. Black said that Mr. Stewart might have benefited most from the news events that marked his tenure -- from the Bush administration to the wars in the Middle East to the rise of 24-hour news channels and the emergence of Barack Obama and the Tea Party.""The show gained its power not just from Jon and not just from the writers of the show, but also the time frame in which it occurred,"" Mr. Black said.""He would turn out every day and do something that would provide people a certain amount of insulation from the madness we're bombarded with from the moment we wake up,"" he continued. ""Whether someone is bombing this place or someone is shooting someone, or some senator said something so profoundly beyond human comprehension that one would consider it fictional if one didn't know this was a real person. But laughter? Laughter allows you to say, 'Ah! I am not a part of this,' and you disengage for a moment.""Photograph Jon Stewart Will Host His Final ""Daily Show"" On Thursday, After 16 Years.

Crisis in Ukraine Underscores Opposing Lessons of Cold War:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MUNICH -- The Cold War is history, but its spirit this weekend stalked the security conference held here each winter for the past 51 years.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Senator John McCain drew very different lessons from the West's 20th-century showdown with the Soviet Union, as they clashed over whether to arm Kiev's troops in response to Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine. That disagreement represents one of the sharpest rifts yet over how the allies should respond to the current challenge from Moscow.Europe is very different from the days when the militaries of NATO and the Soviet bloc stared each other down. But the crisis in Ukraine has reopened familiar differences as to whether the threat of force -- in this case, Washington's readiness to bolster Ukraine's military against pro-Russian rebels backed by the Kremlin -- is more effective than months of so-far failed negotiations.It is not quite Winston Churchill's choice of ""jaw-jaw"" or ""war-war."" Everyone agreed that a negotiated solution is the preferred outcome. Secretary of State John Kerry, addressing the conference on Sunday, insisted therefore that the West is united.But even he said that ""we are in the midst of a defining moment"" in the trans-Atlantic partnership, and there were differences over tactics as leaders headed into another round of talks this week.Ms. Merkel travels to Washington for talks on Monday with President Obama, who is said to be undecided on whether to provide Ukraine with anti-tank artillery and an array of communications and other equipment, which some American officials say could enable Ukraine to build and hold a line against pro-Russian forces moving west in eastern Ukraine.Diplomats will gather for more talks in Berlin on Tuesday. An additional summit of the leaders of France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia is to be held in Minsk, Belarus, on Wednesday.Speaking in Sochi, Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said that a Wednesday meeting would require agreement between Russia and the West on key points beforehand. A meeting then is possible if ""we are able to agree on a number of points that we've recently been discussing intensely,"" he said.On Sunday, Mr. Kerry issued a statement of support for the European efforts, but noted that Washington is concerned by new reports of ""fierce fighting today in Debaltseve and Mariupol, and press references to new Russian convoys into eastern Ukraine.""Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, spoke Saturday of the real danger of a new division in Europe and a ""parting of the ways"" with Mr. Putin if negotiations fail.Laurent Fabius, foreign minister of France, was firm on Sunday that ""what we must seek right now is not peace on paper but peace on the ground.""That echoed comments by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who recalled the many hours he had spent trying to end the conflict.""Don't tell us. Show us, President Putin,"" he said Saturday. ""Too many times President Putin has promised peace and delivered tanks, weapons.""Mr. Putin's view has been that the crisis in Ukraine, far from being a violation of international law, has been caused by a peremptory West eager to impose its way on Russia. Accordingly, his foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, delivered a speech brimming with Cold War-style bromides at the alleged strength of fascists in Ukraine, or Kiev's supposed mistreatment of ethnic Hungarian minorities, which the Russians have cited as causes for them to support the rebels.Emotion is sometimes rare in international diplomacy, but was very much present in the public and private discourse here all weekend.Unusually, Ms. Merkel offered up a memory of her childhood in Communist East Germany in reply to Malcolm Rifkind, a former British foreign and defense secretary, who questioned whether the diplomacy she has pursued in the Ukraine crisis was effective without a threat of force.""Look,"" said Ms. Merkel, who, like President François Hollande of France, had just returned from hours of negotiations with Mr. Putin, ""I grew up in East Germany, and when I was 7 the Berlin Wall was built.""Nobody expected the West to mount a military attack to bring it down, she said, meaning that East Germans waited 28 more years in ""dictatorship and unfreedom"" until the Wall came down in November 1989.She did not begrudge the West, Ms. Merkel said. But she implied that it informed her idea that ""I do not believe that the advances Ukraine needs will be achieved with weapons.""Senator McCain, Republican of Arizona, in remarks on Saturday and a speech on Sunday, rebuffed the chancellor, despite German complaints about his tone while in the country she heads.""Asserting that there is no military solution, which is a truism, should not lead us to believe that there is no military dimension to the problem -- or that hard power can play no role in a favorable solution,"" Mr. McCain told the conference.Responding to Ms. Merkel's Berlin Wall story, Mr. McCain said Saturday, ""What I particularly took exception to was Chancellor Merkel comparing this situation with that during the Cold War.""Hundreds of thousands of Americans had defended West Germany, and ""when Berlin was surrounded, we sent in an airlift,"" he said, recalling the mission that broke the Soviet blockade of Berlin in the late 1940s. ""We didn't say, 'Hey, we don't want to provoke the Russians.' So I just take strong exception to that comparison.""He said the Soviets were kept at bay during the Cold War by ""the price they would have to pay for their aggression, and right now there is no price that Putin is paying for his aggression.""Mr. McCain's view contrasted with the vision of Mr. Steinmeier, who emphasized the need for a peaceful end to the conflict through negotiations.""It would be irresponsible not to use the opportunities we have,"" Mr. Steinmeier said.He spoke broadly of a new ""security model"" that might restore trust with Russia, an idea that seems distant as death and misery spreads in eastern Ukraine.The German foreign minister recalled that a Canadian colleague at a NATO meeting last summer had asked whether Russia should be seen as ""a friend, partner, enemy or opponent to us.""""Perhaps,"" Mr. Steinmeier said, ""this is easier to answer when you are further away from the conflict region. Our experience in Europe -- in good times or bad -- is that Russia remains our neighbor.""It was an observation steeped in decades of Ostpolitik, Germany's policy of détente with Eastern Europe, forged by German Social Democrats like Mr. Steinmeier.Ms. Merkel, a center-right Christian Democrat, governs in coalition with the Social Democrats, another factor influencing her Ukraine policy, in which the two politicians from opposing camps have so far been able to keep the support of most Germans.President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine said Sunday that any Minsk meeting should result in a durable and effective cease-fire in his country. European and American leaders expressed hope that their unity, and not their differences, would prevail.""We have to stick together and we have to negotiate,"" Mr. Fabius said, ""but not agree to concessions that would undermine the key pillars of European security. It is the time to make a choice.""",0.0
Don't Let Progress on Tobacco Evaporate:   [Editorial ],,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported this month that the adult smoking rate in the United States has fallen to a new low, a testament to the decades of education about the dangers of tobacco and measures to discourage its use. Now Republicans in the House are seeking to slash the very government programs that have helped to achieve such remarkable success.Cigarette smoking among adults has been declining since 1965, but in the mid-2000s progress stalled, mostly because state tobacco control programs were curtailed. In 2009, the country was back on track, thanks to an increase in the federal tax on cigarettes and a new law granting the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate tobacco products. Progress has been furthered by insurance coverage for smoking-cessation programs under the Affordable Care Act. The percentage of adults who smoke fell from 20.9 percent in 2005 to 17.8 percent in 2013, 16.8 percent in 2014 and 14.9 percent in the first half of 2015.That progress might well be slowed or reversed if Congress approves two riders attached to an appropriations bill for the 2016 fiscal year by a Republican-dominated House committee. One rider would cut in half the C.D.C.'s budget for tobacco control, from $216.5 million in 2015 to $105.5 million in 2016. That would almost certainly force the agency to eliminate its highly successful ""TIPS From Former Smokers"" media campaign, which has been a very cost-effective effort at persuading smokers to quit. The rider would also reduce federal financing to help states, tribes and territories reduce smoking and operate state ""quitlines,"" phone numbers people can call for help.The second rider would shield from regulation all existing electronic cigarettes, including thousands of flavored products that are designed to attract young people and have become increasingly popular, according to C.D.C. surveys. Dozens of medical organizations have opposed the riders and language that jeopardizes support for surveys that document trends in tobacco use.The Senate has a far more rational approach. The Appropriations Committee recommended the full $216.5 million for tobacco programs at the C.D.C. and did nothing to weaken the F.D.A.'s regulatory powers. Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States. This is no time to slack off.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",0.0

"Passion, Desolation and Chemistry:   [The Arts/Cultural Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDED. There was something a bit perverse about the chamber-music program presented by the New York Philharmonic at the 92nd Street Y on Sunday, part of its three-week Rachmaninoff festival. Sure, the promise of the breathtaking pianist Daniil Trifonov joining forces with the violinist Sheryl Staples and the cellist Carter Brey in the seething ""Trio Élégiaque"" (Op. 9) was all it took to fill the Kaufmann Concert Hall. But to round out the program with two unfinished string quartets -- works that Rachmaninoff abandoned, surely with good reason -- when there is a luscious, masterly cello sonata begging to be played?The emotionally charged performance of the trio, with its moments of heated passion and abject desolation, hinted at a special chemistry among these players, and Mr. Brey and Mr. Trifonov would no doubt have done wonders with that sonata. But at least one of the quartet fragments was here a psychologically revealing marker in the musical development of a composer whose chamber music often absorbed his darkest moods.The Op. 9 trio begins and ends with a somber procession. In between, there are soulful string melodies and magnificent outbursts of pianistic virtuosity, which Mr. Trifonov dispatched with balled power and ringing tone. But most memorable was the end: the strings' sound drained of vibrato, the piano's hooded and wary.The same ashes-to-ashes arc governs the slow movement of the String Quartet No. 2, for which the violinist Michelle Kim and the violist Cynthia Phelps joined Ms. Staples and Mr. Brey. It takes the form of a passacaglia on a pessimistic bass line that creeps up three steps and back again, with the viola responding in little shudders. The music grows more emphatic but never manages to shake the sense of futility to which it succumbs.The String Quartet No. 1 offered only episodic pleasures. Here, in a reversal of many concert experiences, it was the music that failed to rise to the level of the elegant, classy playing.",0.0
New Testament Papyrus Is Discovered on eBay:   [The Arts/Cultural Desk ] [1 ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. Last January, Geoffrey Smith, a scholar of early Christianity at the University of Texas, noticed something startling: an eBay listing for an ancient Greek papyrus fragment of the Gospel of John -- with an opening bid of only $99.""I thought, This can't be allowed to sell on eBay,"" Dr. Smith said. ""It will just disappear into a private collection.""Dr. Smith contacted the seller and urged him to halt the online auction -- apparently the first on eBay for a Greek New Testament papyrus, he and other scholars said -- and let him study the fragment. The seller agreed, and now, on Saturday, Mr. Smith will present his research at the annual conference of the Society of Biblical Literature in Atlanta.The credit-card-size papyrus, which Dr. Smith dates from around A.D. 250 to A.D. 350, contains about six lines of the Gospel of John on one side and an unidentified Christian text on the other. If Dr. Smith's analysis is correct, it is the only known Greek New Testament papyrus from an unused scroll rather than a codex, the emerging book technology that early Christians, in sharp contrast to their Jewish and pagan contemporaries, preferred for their texts.That adds an interesting wrinkle, scholars say, to the story of the rise of the codex, the book as we know it today. But the dramatic story of the papyrus's emergence also speaks to a distinctly 21st-century technological anxiety.""The fact that this one came to light on the Internet speaks to the reality for all of us who deal with manuscripts and antiquities,"" Dr. Smith said. ""We're all trying to come to terms with these things we study, our prized scholarly possessions, are now coming up for sale online.""Greek New Testament papyri are among the oldest and rarest traces of Christian scripture. Only about 130 have been recognized by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research in Münster, Germany, which registers New Testament manuscripts of all types and oversees the effort to reconstruct the Greek initial text from surviving variants.They are also a new entry into the growing -- and, many scholars say, ethically questionable -- online marketplace in ancient papyri.""History doesn't belong to one person,"" said Brice C. Jones, a papyrus expert who tracks online sales, and who wrote about the eBay listing on his blog the same day Dr. Smith noticed it, inadvertently sending bids shooting up.""Collectively, globally, it's ours,"" continued Dr. Jones, who also communicated with the seller, who wishes to remain anonymous. ""It needs to be available for research, to be put on display.""Many scholars refuse to study manuscripts that may have left their country of origin illegally, and some refuse to study material in private collections, on the grounds it helps drive the market.That market is certainly robust. A third-century fragment of Romans on vellum, Dr. Jones noted, sold last year at Sotheby's for nearly $500,000. The seller of the John papyrus, meanwhile, was ""harassed by collectors offering him absurd amounts of money,"" Dr. Smith said, declining to cite a specific figure.While the original provenance of the Gospel of John papyrus is not known, Dr. Smith said that ownership appeared to comply with the Unesco convention, which declares that cultural property legally acquired before 1970 cannot be subject to repatriation claims. (Virtually all papyri come from Egypt.)Dr. Smith declined to identify the seller. But in the text of the listing copied on Dr. Jones's blog, the seller said the papyrus had been in the private collection of Harold R. Willoughby, a professor of early Christianity at the University of Chicago who died in 1962.The seller, who identified himself in the listing as a relative of Mr. Willoughby, told Mr. Smith that he had found the papyrus only recently, after opening a suitcase of Mr. Willoughby's possessions that he had acquired in 1990 and stashed in his attic.The fragment, which was encased in glass, ""literally fell out of a stack of letters,"" the seller said in the listing.Both a collection inventory written in Mr. Willoughby's handwriting and a typed estate inventory compiled after his death listed the papyrus, thus confirming, Dr. Smith said, that it had been part of his collection in 1962.The eBay listing identified the item's location as New Hampshire. Dr. Smith inspected and photographed it during a visit with the seller in March in an undisclosed meeting place. ""I have no knowledge of where it is being stored,"" he said. ""But it didn't look like it has suffered any recent damage.""What the wider scholarly community will make of the new papyrus remains to be seen. But experts who have reviewed Dr. Smith's research say he has made a strong case -- based on highly technical aspects of the papyrus -- that it is from a scroll, not a codex.That may seem like a subtle point, but it's significant, scholars say. Larry Hurtado, an expert in early Christian manuscripts at the University of Edinburgh, said in an interview that early Christianity was ""a bookish religion"" that displayed a ""maniacal preoccupation with texts,"" with a clear preference for the codex at a time when it was far from obvious to most people that it was more user-friendly.According to Dr. Hurtado's calculations, 97 percent of Christian biblical texts that survive from the first three centuries A.D., including those from the Old Testament, are codexes. Except for a few texts on the back of previously used scrolls, all known Greek New Testament papyri are codexes.The new papyrus, on which the John text appears to be on the front of the scroll, ""breaks that pattern,"" Dr. Hurtado said. ""This shows that preference was not absolute.""The fact that it has another text copied on the other side (seemingly in the same low-quality handwriting), Dr. Hurtado added, suggests that it was intended for private study, rather than liturgical use.""What we may have here is someone's prized possession,"" he said.AnneMarie Luijendijk, a professor of religion at Princeton University who also reviewed Dr. Smith's paper, said that to her, the most intriguing aspect of the manuscript is that both the John text and the unidentified Christian text appear to be in the same handwriting -- a very unusual feature for any of the reused scrolls, Christian or otherwise, that survive from antiquity, she said.""If it was in a personal library, and then the same scribe turned it around to write the other text, what does that mean?"" Dr. Luijendijk said. ""It's really puzzling.""Dr. Smith said he continued to urge the seller to place the papyrus in a research library. He is also working on another Greek New Testament papyrus, a fragment of Ephesians that he found the old-fashioned way: in a huge cache of manuscripts at Oxford University excavated in Egypt in the late 19th and early 20th century.That pipeline of new material, he said, had slowed in more recent years, increasing pressure on scholars to be open to less traditional sources.""It's possible for things to come up online that are completely legal to own,"" Dr. Smith said. ""When things show up with appropriate documentation, we need to become more comfortable with studying them.""",0.0
A Pro Basketball Podcast Finds Success on Television:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"""Is Russell Westbrook a cat or a dog?""Westbrook is, in fact, the star point guard for the Oklahoma City Thunder, so this was a somewhat jarring question to pose to his fellow players during the National Basketball Association's All-Star weekend in 2013. Nonetheless, they played along.James Harden thought Westbrook was more of a dog. Dwyane Wade hedged. ""He's a cat-dog,"" he said.Finally, Westbrook weighed in. ""Wolf,"" he said.The cat-or-dog question came from a host of ""The Basketball Jones,"" an N.B.A. podcast started in 2006 by three Canadian basketball fanatics who will bring their blend of deep basketball analysis and irreverent, goofy attitude to the N.B.A.'s All-Star festivities this weekend in New York.""I always think we were made for All-Star weekend, because it's supposed to be fun,"" says Phil Elder, one of the hosts, who is known professionally as J. E. Skeets.But this year, the hosts of ""The Jones"" will be broadcasting for the league itself. A little more than a year ago, ""The Jones"" podcast was rebranded as ""The Starters,"" a television program shown weeknights on NBATV. It is available to stream live and download as a podcast but it exists primarily as a television broadcast. In its second season, ""The Starters"" is growing quickly in popularity. According to the network, viewership has increased by 24 percent this season, with podcast downloads up 22 percent. NBATV says it will continue to raise the show's profile. Plans for this weekend include an hourlong live show at 6 p.m. Friday, with player interviews and an appearance by the basketball great George Gervin.""They prove you can be entertaining and smart on TV without being overbearing and loud about it,"" said Zach Lowe, an N.B.A. writer for the Grantland website and a podcaster.In the wake of the hit true-crime show ""Serial,"" podcasts are widely acknowledged to be growing. A recent report from Edison Research indicates a ""dramatic increase in podcast consumption.""Jeff Ullrich, the co-founder of the podcasting network Earwolf, says the shift has been palpable.""My 70-year-old retired dentist in St. Charles, Ill., is telling me that he can relate to the thing that I have done in my career, when 18 months ago my best friends didn't know what a podcast was,"" he said.""The Starters"" hosts are part of a wave of podcasting personalities jumping to television, including the soccer commentators ""Men in Blazers,"" the comedian Marc Maron and the hosts of ""Comedy Bang Bang."" But the basketball enthusiasts acknowledge that the shift can be challenging. ""The Starters"" television show occasionally feels less rich to longtime fans of the podcasts.""What you're hearing on the podcast is years of repetition and experience, so it's kind of ingrained in us, and it's pretty easy,"" said one of the hosts, Tassos Melas, who goes by Tas. ""While on the TV side, not that we're not good at it, but it's different every year. It's just not shooting the breeze as easily,"" he said.""They're two completely different mediums,"" Mr. Elder said. ""Everyone was telling us, 'It's not the same, it's not the same.' Well it's not the same because it's a TV show we're making.""Though ""The Starters' "" television audience is growing, Mr. Elder and Mr. Melas, with the show's other personalities, Trey Kerby and Leigh Ellis, have not abandoned podcasting. This season they introduced ""The Drop,"" a weekly, podcast-only show that is downloaded 70 percent more frequently on average than the podcast of the daily ""The Starters"" television show, according to the network. Last week's episode featured references to Katy Perry's Super Bowl halftime show and a discussion of some of the more handsome N.B.A. stars.""The Starters"" TV show has tried to incorporate the lighter elements of ""The Basketball Jones"" podcast in a way that recreates the spontaneity of its hosts' old material. On their show last Thursday, in a segment called ""Meme Team,"" the hosts counted down some of the goofiest moments from the N.B.A. that week. Number one on the countdown was Westbrook's reaction to being stiffed on a high five by a teammate. In the video, he turned around sharply and glared at the offending player.""That screams cat to me,"" Mr. Elder said. ""Case closed, right? He's more like a cat.""Photograph ""The Starters"" Personalities, From Left, Trey Kerby, Phil Elder, Tassos Melas and Leigh Ellis.",0.0
"Rapper, Shaped by Tumultuous German Youth, Is Designated a Global Terrorist:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BERLIN -- Denis Cuspert was drawn early to gangsta rap, and later to Islam. Born and raised in West Berlin, jeered at as a half-African child and often at odds with his American stepfather, he fell in with Salafists in Germany, left for Egypt in 2012 and made his way, eventually, to Syria. By last spring, the German authorities said, he had joined Islamic State guerrillas and swore allegiance to their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.This week, Mr. Cuspert was transformed again. The American State Department announced Monday that, as ""a willing pitchman"" for the extremist group's ""atrocities,"" Mr. Cuspert was now a ""specially designated global terrorist"" sought worldwide.The designation means that Mr. Cuspert, 39, has gone from being a notorious figure in Germany to one recognized everywhere, and it puts him in the cross hairs of American intelligence in the Syrian region.The potential evidence against him includes a July 2014 video that, a German report says, shows Mr. Cuspert and a pile of corpses in civilian clothes, apparently victims of a battle for control of the much-contested Shaer gas field near Homs in Syria.""Cuspert has been on the radar for a while, mainly because he's so high profile,"" said a former senior American counterterrorism official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence reports.The announcement in Washington followed declarations by President Obama and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Monday, during her visit to the White House, about their continuing cooperation in tracking terror suspects and gathering intelligence in the region.The relationship between Germany and the United States on intelligence-gathering was shaken in 2013 after Edward J. Snowden revealed the extent to which ordinary Germans were affected and Der Spiegel reported that the Americans had eavesdropped on Ms. Merkel's cellphone.At the White House on Monday, Mr. Obama appealed to Germans, who are sensitive about government surveillance because of their Nazi and Communist pasts, to trust Americans not to overstep the line. Ms. Merkel, in turn, stressed how Germany relies on the United States' intelligence-gathering capacity to guarantee public safety.State Department officials in Washington said on Tuesday that the designation of Mr. Cuspert had been published without fanfare in the American government's Federal Register on Jan. 27.Mr. Cuspert, a.k.a. the rapper Deso Dogg, now goes by Abu Talha al-Almani, according to German and American officials.He became one of the best-known singers of nasheeds, or Islamic devotional music, in German. According to security officials and excerpts from videos posted online, Mr. Cuspert sings of the comradeship of battle.His themes include martyrdom: ""I wish for my death and can hardly wait for it/Armed with bombs and grenades,"" goes one song from 2013, according to a report on Mr. Cuspert compiled by security officials in Berlin.That report concluded that ""in just four years, he developed from a respected, but financially not very successful, 'gangsta rapper' to an internationally recognized propagandist of jihad and Salafism.""Mr. Cuspert was born in Berlin to a German mother and a Ghanaian father who soon left the family. His American stepfather, a former soldier, was a strict disciplinarian, and conflicts at home increased until Mr. Cuspert spent five years in a home for troubled children. ""I grew up with racism,"" he told The New York Times in 2011.He said he had joined youth gangs because he was in search of an identity. From an early age, he trained in Thai boxing, taekwondo and jujitsu.His rap career reached its zenith when he went on tour with DMX in 2006.By 2010, according to Berlin security officials, he had appeared in a video with Pierre Vogel, a well-known Salafist preacher, who asked about rap connections and what might happen if other rappers embraced Islam.In 2011, when a 21-year-old immigrant from Kosovo, Arid Uka, fatally shot two American airmen at the Frankfurt airport, he said he had opened fire after seeing a video that claimed to show a Muslim woman being raped by men in United States military uniforms. Mr. Cuspert acknowledged posting the video, which Mr. Uka copied. American officials said it was staged.In 2012, Mr. Cuspert fell in with an Austrian, Mohamed Mahmoud, and they started a group, Millatu Ibrahim, that was banned after a clash with the police. The two men left for Egypt, reportedly heading for Mali, but landed eventually in Syria.There, according to German intelligence officials, Mr. Cuspert suffered head wounds in battle in September 2013, but after hospitalization in Turkey returned to the fighting last spring.The Berlin report on Mr. Cuspert, published last September, concluded with mention of the video that it said showed him among the pile of corpses.Frauke Köhler, a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor's office in Germany, declined to confirm a news report that Mr. Cuspert was being investigated on suspicion of committing war crimes, along with another German jihadist, identified as Farid S., whose wife is on trial in Düsseldorf on charges of delivering 11,000 euros and camera equipment to her husband in Syria.Robert Rigney, a Berlin-born American who said he had spent almost 15 years here, teaching and writing about immigrant communities, said he had come across Mr. Cuspert in Berlin's Kreuzberg district around 2009.""Everyone in Berlin knows this guy,"" he said, alluding to immigrant neighborhoods and the high school dropouts, and rap fans, he teaches.

Pomegranate Juice Maker Loses Trademark Fight:   [Brief ],,"The pomegranate juice maker Pom Wonderful cannot stop a smaller rival from selling a pomegranate-flavored energy drink with a similar name, a federal court ruled on Thursday. It was the second time Pom Wonderful had failed to obtain an injunction against the energy drink labeled ""pom,"" made by Pur Beverages, in a continuing trademark dispute. Judge Margaret M. Morrow of United States District Court in Los Angeles said in her ruling that Pom did not deserve an injunction because it could not show it would be harmed without one. Pom sued Robert Hubbard, Pur Beverages' founder, in 2013 for trademark infringement, saying consumers would be deceived into thinking Mr. Hubbard's energy drink was associated with Pom Wonderful. Pom said that its reputation as a health-conscious brand would suffer if it were associated with Mr. Hubbard's beverage.

Chief of Pfizer Defends Merger as Good for U.S.:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"In phone calls to Washington lawmakers and Obama administration officials, the chief executive of the largest drug maker in the nation had a surprising message: A deal that would allow the company to move its headquarters to Ireland was actually good for the United States.The Scottish-born chief executive of Pfizer, Ian C. Read, told them that a merger with Allergan, the maker of Botox that is based in Dublin, would significantly cut Pfizer's tax bill and give it more cash that it could invest in the United States and ultimately add jobs, according to people briefed on the calls. He made the calls in recent days as the two companies were hammering out a $152 billion deal.Monday's announcement of the deal -- the biggest merger in 15 years -- has revived a fierce public debate over whether mergers that allow a company in the United States to relocate to a lower-tax country are, in fact, good for America.Pfizer, founded by German immigrants in Brooklyn in 1849, is becoming the biggest company yet to shed its American citizenship to lower its taxes. While not structured as what is known as an inversion, it achieves the same goal of a lower tax rate abroad.An aborted bid by Pfizer to acquire AstraZeneca of Britain in an inversion last year set off a public uproar -- leading President Obama to call such deals ""unpatriotic"" -- and prompted moves by the Treasury to curb them.The latest merger announcement has stirred a similar outcry across the political spectrum.Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Democratic candidate for president, said, ""We cannot delay in cracking down on inversions that erode our tax base.""Donald J. Trump, a Republican candidate for president, said in a statement: ""The fact that Pfizer is leaving our country with a tremendous loss of jobs is disgusting. Our politicians should be ashamed.""Yet the two companies and their advisers are betting that the Treasury Department will not be able to come up with new rules to block the union, and that Congress will fail to revamp the tax code before the merger's expected close late next year.And as Mr. Read has made clear publicly and privately, his main priority is doing well by his shareholders -- and that means finding a way to compete with huge foreign rivals that enjoy much lower tax rates.""We've assessed the legal, regulatory and political landscape and are moving forward with our strategy to combine these two great companies for the benefit of the patients and to bring value to shareholders,"" Mr. Read said on Monday on a call with analysts. ""That is our obligation.""Mr. Read and those close to him have noted that Pfizer, based in New York, has been upfront about its intentions. Even after its takeover campaign for AstraZeneca collapsed, the Pfizer chief made no secret of his desire to try again, while criticizing a tax code that he said leaves his company fighting with one hand tied behind its back.The drug maker, which manufactured penicillin during World War II, has complained that its tax rate last year was 26 percent, compared with the approximately 5 percent that Allergan's predecessor company paid during that same time.Bigger international rivals, from GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca of Britain to Novartis of Switzerland, also pay substantially less in taxes, potentially letting them win takeover contests with higher bids.Perhaps more important, Pfizer kept overseas $74 billion in profits that were earned abroad last year, because bringing them home would have racked up billions of dollars in taxes.Since the AstraZeneca bid, the Obama administration has introduced new rules that have made it harder for companies to do inversion deals, scuttling efforts by companies like AbbVie, a large drug maker based in Illinois, to relocate abroad.From the beginning of their deal discussions nearly three months ago, Pfizer and Allergan agreed that the best way forward was to forgo an inversion altogether, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Instead, Allergan would serve as the buyer despite being substantially smaller.Mindful of the sensitivity in Washington, Pfizer included in its advisory team the boutique investment bank Moelis & Company, whose vice chairman is Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader.While Mr. Cantor will not lobby lawmakers, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, he has advised the company on political aspects of the deal and maintains friendly contact with his former colleagues.Despite the political uproar, the merger is not expected to encounter significant resistance from the American regulator that will review the transaction, the Federal Trade Commission, according to the people with direct knowledge of the deal.A spokesman for the Treasury Department said on Monday that it did not comment on specific transactions. Still, the department has clearly signaled its distaste for deals that move a company's tax home.The particular design of Monday's transaction, however, effectively shields Pfizer and Allergan from the administration's efforts to curb such deals.When the Treasury Department announced its latest rule changes on Thursday, advisers to both companies sat down to review the changes -- and quickly went back to work on their negotiations, the people with direct knowledge of the matter said.""Treasury's proposals don't touch them,"" said Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant who examined the deal.Presidential candidates offered swift condemnation of the transaction all the same.Such transactions, Mrs. Clinton said, ""take advantage of loopholes that litter our tax code, distort incentives for investment and disadvantage small businesses and domestic firms that cannot game the international tax system.""Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic candidate for president, said, ""The Obama administration has the authority to stop this merger, and it should exercise that authority.""Yet others said a broader tax overhaul was needed.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the news of the merger ""only further underscores the arcane, anticompetitive nature of the U.S. tax code.""Executives at both Pfizer and Allergan are betting that Congress will continue to be conflicted about how to deal with inversions. Republicans, who control the House and the Senate, have called for a comprehensive regulatory overhaul and have shown reluctance to focus on particular companies.""It's not clear what Washington's wishes are,"" said one person close to the transaction. ""We tried to tell them to fix our tax system. It's not like this is a surprise.""At the same time, both Mr. Read and his counterpart at Allergan, Brenton L. Saunders, have emphasized that the deal isn't being done just to cut taxes.Both executives contend the deal gives Pfizer access to fast-growing treatments in the eye care and dermatology space, as well as brands like Botox and the cosmetic treatment Juvéderm.Moreover, it will give Pfizer enough size and product diversity to break itself up in three years' time, dividing itself into a company focused on faster-growing innovative drugs and another built on more mature treatments that face competition from generic competitors. The company said on Monday that it would decide in late 2018 whether to proceed with a split.Buying Allergan will bring more fast-growing treatments to Pfizer's portfolio. That would complement Pfizer's $17 billion acquisition of the generic drug maker Hospira earlier this year, meant to bulk up its so-called established treatments division.Under the terms of the deal, Pfizer would essentially pay $363.63 for each Allergan share, representing a nearly 30 percent premium to Allergan's share price in late October before news emerged that they were in talks. That values the acquisition at $152 billion. Including debt and subtracting cash, the deal is worth $160 billion.After the transaction, Pfizer shareholders are expected to own about 56 percent of the combined company, with the remaining 44 percent owned by Allergan shareholders. Mr. Read will be chief executive of the new Pfizer P.L.C., to be based in Dublin, while Mr. Saunders will become president, and will be in line to take over one of the company's businesses if and when it decides to break itself up.Investors appeared unimpressed. Shares of Allergan fell 3.4 percent, while Pfizer's ended down 2.6 percent.The expected cost savings of about $2 billion over the first three years announced after the deal was made were well below most analysts' projections. And the $5 billion in planned stock buybacks that also were announced on Monday were in line with Pfizer's previous efforts.Some analysts still regarded the deal positively, so far as it ties into Pfizer's goals.""Allergan was easier to get done as a friendly deal in terms of getting a structure done and management roles done,"" said Jeffrey Holford, an analyst with Jefferies.To some involved in the deal, the tax savings are all that matters. ""If the tax stuff went away entirely, the deal would be off,"" a person briefed on Mr. Read's thinking said.",0.0
Women Seek a Bigger Beanpot:   [Sports Desk ],,"BOSTON -- Before the first women's Beanpot hockey tournament, in 1979, Harvard Coach Joe Bertagna purchased a two-toned brown beanpot for $6 at Howard's Flying Dragon Antiques in Essex, Mass.For 35 years, until a more regal-looking silver trophy replaced it in 2014, Bertagna's beanpot was awarded to the tournament's champion and treated like the Stanley Cup -- in stature and as a celebratory prop.""It's probably a little worse for the wear after we were done with it,"" said Alison Quandt, a goaltender on Boston College's 2006 team that won the Eagles' first Beanpot title. The men's Beanpot, featuring Boston College, Boston University, Northeastern and Harvard, began in 1952 and is quite possibly the most prestigious in-season tournament in college hockey. Bertagna and the other teams' coaches formulated the idea for a women's Beanpot at a bar in Harvard Square in the late 1970s, and since 1979, the women's Beanpot tournament has been played with the tradition of the men's tournament, if not the pomp.The women's competition has grown to include some of the game's premier players, but they are still fighting to gain recognition from a larger audience.In Tuesday's final, No. 1 Boston College (27-0-1) will play No. 4 Harvard (18-4-2). Boston University, which fell in the opening round to Harvard, 9-2, on Feb. 3, was ranked sixth at the time. Northeastern has won a record 16 tournament titles.""Our kids get up for the Beanpot even more than maybe a Hockey East championship game,"" said Northeastern Coach Dave Flint, whose team lost, 3-1, to Boston College in the opening round.While Boston College was the favorite entering this year's tournament, Harvard and Northeastern dominated for decades, combining to win 25 of the first 27 championships, often by lopsided scores. In 1995, Northeastern defeated Boston University, 24-0, in the first round.A contributing factor to the imbalance was the varsity status of the Harvard and Northeastern teams, while Boston University and Boston College competed at the club level. During the past 10 years, though, as all four teams began operating as Division I programs, the four Boston-area teams have developed into perennial contenders, combining for eight Frozen Four appearances. Boston College has won five Beanpot titles in the past nine years.Bertagna, who is now the Hockey East commissioner and has been the women's tournament administrator since 2004, said the success of the women's teams validated the increased support from within their respective athletic departments.In the early Beanpot years, respect and money for women's hockey were scarce.Diane DerBoghosian, who won the first women's Beanpot's Most Valuable Player Award for Northeastern in 1979, started a club team with several other female students at Northeastern whom she met in weekend recreation leagues. They held bake sales for financing and car-pooled to games to save money. DerBoghosian often drove her 1977 brown Ford Pinto, which was purchased for $800 and barely carried four players and their equipment.The team also practiced at the whim of the men's team.""Our ice time wasn't always at ideal times,"" DerBoghosian said. ""We had to take a back seat to the men's hockey team that was practicing and playing in the same arena. We were always in the background, typical back then.""While the men's Beanpot tournament is now held before near-capacity crowds at TD Garden, the home rink of the Boston Bruins, the women's teams take turns hosting their event. This year's games are being played at Harvard's Bright-Landry Hockey Center, which seats about 2,800. Bertagna said that when the arena was being renovated in the late 1970s, university officials wanted to put the women's hockey team's lockers in an adjoining building that housed an indoor track.Each year, Beanpot participants traditionally receive a gift, and Flint said women's teams were often given a hat, at most.Today, men's and women's teams receive tokens of equal value, usually in the form of gift cards. But while the gifts for the men's teams are paid by TD Garden and tournament receipts, the four universities split the cost of the women's gifts.Bertagna said there was no official alliance between the men's and women's Beanpot committees, although they hold luncheons throughout the year and regularly discuss ideas for both tournaments. One point of conversation has been the request to feature the women's Beanpot final at TD Garden, as the opening of a doubleheader with the men's final.""I think it's the way it should be,"" Harvard Coach Katey Stone said. ""These women work their tails off. They deserve to play in front of great crowds. People would be pleasantly surprised by the product on the ice.""Bertagna said he believed they were earnestly working toward relocating the women's final.""It's not being dismissed out of hand, which I think at one time it might've been,"" he said. ""But anything that has so much tradition, it takes a little time for people to wrap their arms around doing something different after 60-some odd years.""Boston University Coach Brian Durocher noted how each team in the women's Beanpot has Olympians on its roster, but he was frustrated that there might not be enough interest in seeing them play in front of bigger crowds.The 2014 Winter Olympics gold medal game, a 3-2 overtime classic won by Canada over the United States, featured six players who competed in this year's Beanpot. Yet at the start of last Tuesday's opening-round games, only about 200 people were in attendance. Hundreds more arrived throughout the night -- the official attendance was 1,181 -- including a number of girls hockey clubs that received donated tickets.""I know it will never get the recognition that the men's tournament gets, that's just a fact of life,"" Flint said. ""But I think they do a pretty good job with it, promoting it. I've seen the attendance grow.""This year, snow had postponed the men's opening-round games from their traditional slot on the first Monday in February, so the men's and women's Beanpots were played simultaneously. Across town, at TD Garden, 14,520 were in attendance.Nonetheless, Emily Field, a senior forward for Boston College, was impressed by the turnout for the women's games.""On a Tuesday night at five o'clock after a big snowstorm, it's kind of unbelievable,"" she said. ""It wasn't like that a few years ago, and I hope it continues to grow.""There were Northeastern and Boston College fans at the first women's opening-round game who also had tickets to watch the men's teams play later that night. After supporting the men's team earlier in the evening, the Boston University pep band arrived midway through the second period of the women's game, as did a number of Terriers alumni and students.Boston College forward Danielle Doherty, who grew up in nearby Newton, attended the women's Beanpot as a child. The rinks were so empty, she could go up to the end of the boards and slap hands with players she idolized.From her time as a fan to fulfilling a dream of playing in the Beanpot, Doherty said the tournament had grown tangibly and symbolically.""I remember the first trophy: It was on like a little wooden box, and it kind of broke off,"" she said. ""Now we feel a little bit more important with the big metal one.""Photograph Boston College's Alex Carpenter, Top, During the Eagles' 3-1 Win Over Northeastern in the Beanpot Women's Semifinals.

Landslide Near Jade Mine in Myanmar Kills About 100:   [Foreign Desk ],,"YANGON, Myanmar -- A landslide near a jade mine in northern Myanmar on Saturday evening killed about 100 people, most of them villagers digging for green stones in a mountain of displaced earth, a witness and a community leader said Sunday. Many other people were missing.The landslide occurred in the Kachin State area of Hpakant, said Brang Seng, a jade businessman, who watched as bodies were pulled from the debris and taken to a hospital morgue.""People were crying,"" he said. ""I'm hearing that more than 100 people died. In some cases, entire families were lost.""Lamai Gum Ja, a community leader, said that homes at the base of the mine dump had been flattened.He estimated that 100 to 200 people were still missing. Search and rescue teams wearing bright orange uniforms dug through the rubble for survivors on Sunday.Kachin, which is about 600 miles north of Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city, has some of the highest-quality jade in the world.The industry generated an estimated $31 billion last year, with most of the wealth going to individuals and companies tied to Myanmar's former military rulers, according to Global Witness, an advocacy group focused on natural resources.Hpakant, the center of the jade industry, remains very poor, with bumpy dirt roads, constant electricity blackouts and high rates of heroin addiction.After Myanmar's former military rulers handed over power to a nominally civilian government five years ago, resulting in the lifting of many Western sanctions, the already rapid pace of mining turned frenetic. Few scraps of ground or parts of daily life in Hpakant have been untouched by the fleets of giant yellow trucks and backhoes that have sliced apart mountains.In the past year, dozens of small-scale miners have been maimed or killed while picking through tailing dumps.""Large companies, many of them owned by families of former generals, army companies, cronies and drug lords, are making tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year through their plunder of Hpakant,"" said Mike Davis, the Asia director at Global Witness.""Their legacy to local people is a dystopian wasteland in which scores of people at a time are buried alive in landslides,"" Mr. Davis said.",0.0
Height Meets Heft:   [Real Estate Desk ],,"Fueled by a scarcity of land and by demand from multimillionaires willing to pay record prices for helicopter views of Central Park and beyond, Manhattan developers are building ever taller, ever thinner apartment buildings on ever tinier lots. Clustered mostly in and around West 57th Street, these skinny skyscrapers are reaching heights of more than 1,000 feet.One consequence of beanstalk proportions: The higher and slimmer buildings get, the more they tend to sway at the top.On a typically breezy day, a tower 1,000 feet tall might move a couple of inches, according to Rowan Williams Davies and Irwin, consulting engineers. About once a year, a 50-mile-per-hour wind comes up, moving a tower of this size about half a foot. On a rare day, say once every 50 years, 100-mile-per-hour winds might move the tower as much as two feet.While such movement does not present a safety hazard and is often imperceptible, it can make some people woozy. So developers of skinny skyscrapers are installing giant counterweights, or dampening systems, at the apex of their towers to offset building motion. This ballast is not an amenity proclaimed in large type in a glossy brochure -- or one most developers care to talk about. Nevertheless, it is viewed as state-of-the-art assurance for the penthouse-buying set.""It makes sense to do it, because who wants to wear a seasick band when you're at your house?"" joked Brian K. Lewis, an associate broker at Halstead Property, who is representing a buyer in contract at 780-foot-tall 520 Park Avenue, and other buyers considering apartments at the towers One57 on West 57th Street and 432 Park Avenue, which all have dampening systems. ""They're not marketing it,"" he added.Dampening systems are not as alluring a draw as a slick lobby. One type, called a tuned mass damper, is made of steel or concrete, weighs anywhere from 300 to 800 tons and is housed with other mechanical equipment at the top of the building. A typical system can take up approximately 1,000 square feet of space and utilizes a double-height ceiling. Connected to the structure's walls by a system of pistons and spring mounts, the damper acts like a massive shock absorber, pulling the building back toward its original position whenever high winds blow.Another type of damper, known as a slosh damper or slosh tank, uses tons of water instead of steel to add weight to the top of a building.""It's this incredible bit of technology that really gets hidden,"" said Stephen DeSimone, the president of DeSimone Consulting Engineers, which specializes in the design of high-rises. His firm is employing mass dampers to help minimize sway at rising buildings, including Time Equities' 50 West, a 780-foot-tall curved glass condominium in Lower Manhattan, and 100 East 53rd Street, a 710-foot-tall condominium by Vanke, Hines and RFR Holding. ""Nobody knows it's there, standing guard, if you will.""These massive stabilizers are increasingly an integral part of skyscraper design in New York as buildings climb from ever smaller bases. In the last five years, Rowan Williams Davies and Irwin, a Canadian firm, a.k.a R.W.D.I., has worked on nine water-based and 14 mechanical dampers in New York. That's up from just four slosh tanks and three tuned mass dampers between the late 1990s and the last recession.Right now, at least 10 luxury Manhattan apartment buildings under construction plan to install one.Among them: 111 West 57th Street, the 1,428-foot-tall condominium and conversion of the landmark Steinway building undertaken by JDS Development Group and Property Markets Group; 53W53, the 1,050-foot tall apartment house next door to the Museum of Modern Art, by Hines, Goldman Sachs and the Pontiac Land Group of Singapore; Vornado Realty Trust's 950-foot-tall limestone tower at 220 Central Park South; and 111 Murray Street, a 792-foot-tall curved glass condominium by Fisher Brothers, Witkoff and New Valley, on the edge of TriBeCa.Then there's 432 Park Avenue, a venture of CIM Group and Macklowe Properties, which topped out last year at 1,396 feet and holds the title for the tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere. It has two tuned mass dampers.Dampening systems are not required by the New York City building code, and structural engineers emphasize that this equipment has nothing to do with the integrity of the building.""It's purely about comfort,"" said Silvian Marcus, a director of building structures for WSP, an international engineering consultancy. ""It's related to money and how luxurious the place is.""Builders put skyscrapers through all kinds of tests to make sure they will perform well in every conceivable weather condition. Scale models are placed in wind tunnel machines that simulate extreme winds. Based on the results, changes can be made in the design, like shoring up the building with thicker walls and columns.The terra-cotta panels and bronze latticework on the east and west facades of 111 West 57th, for example, were designed partly to reduce the wind forces on the building.Granted, all skyscrapers sway to some degree. And most of the time that movement is so slight it is imperceptible. But with tuned mass dampers costing relatively little -- roughly $5 million, not much in the scheme of things, with penthouses selling for as much as $100 million -- it's worth the investment for developers to ensure that the buyers of their apartments rarely, if ever, have any reason to consider wind speed.""Unless you're a supersensitive person, you're probably not going to feel it,"" said Izak Senbahar, a developer of 56 Leonard, an 821-foot TriBeCa tower that is to have a water-based damper. ""But if you're building a luxury apartment, you have to think about the comfort of every buyer."" In that sense, he said, ""I think it's a must.""Most of the developers contacted for this article were not willing to discuss the dampers going into their buildings. If they were concerned that doing so might incite jitters among potential penthouse buyers, they wouldn't say.Mr. Senbahar, one of two developers who returned calls by deadline, likened the system to any other building amenity. ""Your marketing people may not think a damper is sexy,"" he said, pointing out that marketers tend to be more excited about features like dog spas than building engineering. ""I was joking,"" he added, ""but a damper and a dog-grooming station are just two amenities of a building.""Another developer not shy about discussing building sway was Simon Koster, a principal of JDS Development Group, which with the Property Markets Group is building 111 West 57th Street. With a 60-foot-wide tower, the 1,428-foot condominium is perhaps the slimmest of them all. Designed by SHoP Architects, it will have an 800-ton tuned mass damper.""Is the building structurally sound without the damper? The answer is absolutely,"" Mr. Koster said. ""All buildings move. It's about tailoring that movement"" for the comfort of the occupants.Engineers have no problems talking about dampers, enthusing about aspect ratios, milli-g's and other measurements that go into their design. They point out that it is not so much the actual displacement of a building that is pertinent, but rather the acceleration and deceleration of the building's sway when winds kick up.""When you're in a car, you may be going 60 miles per hour and you don't feel it,"" said Eli Gottlieb, a senior principal of Thornton Tomasetti, a New York engineering firm that is working on at least three Manhattan buildings that will have dampers. ""But every time the car accelerates or decelerates or changes lanes, you feel the start and stop.""That sensation is acceptable in a moving vehicle partly because it's expected, engineers say. In a building, however, people don't anticipate that the floor will move. ""It's your home,"" said Mr. Marcus of WSP. ""Imagine you start eating and you see the wine in your glass going left to right.""While slosh-inducing storms are rare, a damper would slow the acceleration, measured in milli-g's, by up to 50 percent, according to R.W.D.I. The perception of motion, therefore, would also be reduced.To give developers an idea of what those milli-g's actually feel like, R.W.D.I. has teamed up with the Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland. There, a simulator designed to replicate the movement of oceangoing vessels in rough seas for mariner training offers a virtual reality experience of building sway in blustery weather.The simulator, usually outfitted to look like the bridge of a ship, is decorated with furniture when a developer is the client, including a couch, a chandelier and wine glasses filled with water. Instead of rocky seas, city views are projected on the walls. While clients sit, stand or lean against a kitchen counter as they might at home, ""we take it through the full range,"" with and without a damper, said Jon Galsworthy, a principal of R.W.D.I.The developers get an idea of what they might expect to feel without a damper on, say, a windy day in the spring, during a big nor'easter, or when a hurricane hits. ""It makes it very, very real and leaves a very distinct impression,"" he said.So what exactly does it feel like? ""You get a little dizzy and a little disoriented,"" said Maria Halfyard, a manager of the Center for Marine Simulation at the Fisheries and Marine Institute. ""You're like, whoa, this is weird. I'm in a building and I'm moving and I feel like I'm getting motion sick.""But those who have lived in high places say the sway can also be exciting. ""I actually thought it was really cool,"" said Christopher Meloni, the actor, who lived with his family on the 60th floor of the Park Imperial in Midtown Manhattan for several years until moving to Los Angeles a couple years ago.Even though the Park Imperial has a dampening system, Mr. Meloni said he ""would feel the sensation and then I would look to my right and I'd see the buildings next door moving back and forth through my framed window and go, 'O.K., I'm not crazy.'""To me, the joy about living that high is the weather phenomenon,"" he added. ""Sometimes you're fogged in and so you feel, 'here I am flying through the clouds.' You'll see the storm fronts coming from over New Jersey and over the middle of the Hudson. It always was very, very exciting.""Mr. Meloni's apartment is on the market for $8.95 million. With its high-floor panoramic views, said Mr. Lewis, the listing broker of Halstead Property, it is ""attracting strong interest.""Photograph Among the Tall and Skinny Buildings in Manhattan with Dampening Systems Are, Clockwise From Above: 50 West Street (Center of Frame); 111 West 57th Street; 432 Park Avenue (to the Right of the Empire State Building, Which Predates the Technology); and 53 West 53rd Street.

Tied State House Race in Mississippi Is Decided by a Straw:   [National Desk ],,"JACKSON, Miss. -- Sometimes American politics is about ideas, powered by Jeffersons and Adamses and Reagans. Sometimes it is about strategy, with races determined by the chess-match machinations of Axelrods and Roves.But every once in a while, the fate of governments is determined by a considerably less eminent character, one usually found lurking in back-alley craps games and on the Vegas strip: Lady Luck.In Mississippi on Friday, luck smiled on a Democratic state representative, Blaine Eaton II, who had been forced, by state law, to draw straws for his seat after his race for re-election ended in a tie. On Friday afternoon, in a short, strange ceremony here presided over by Gov. Phil Bryant and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, Mr. Eaton and his Republican challenger, Mark Tullos, each removed a silver box from a bag. Mr. Eaton opened his box to reveal a long green straw.And with that, a mathematically improbable tie for the House District 79 seat -- each candidate had received exactly 4,589 votes -- had been broken, though not by the voters.Moments after winning, Mr. Eaton, who raises cattle and grows timber and soybeans, attributed his win to a farmer's luck. ""There's always happiness in a good crop year,"" he said.A lawyer for Mr. Tullos said that a challenge had been filed with the State House of Representatives. Mr. Tullos, a lawyer himself, declined to comment but had said he planned a challenge if he lost the draw. He had cited concerns about the way a county election board handled nine paper ""affidavit ballots"" filed by voters who believed their names were erroneously left off the voter rolls.Resorting to a game of chance to break an electoral tie is common in many states, and coin tosses are often used to settle smaller local races. But in few instances had the pot been as rich as this: If Mr. Tullos had won, his fellow Republicans would have gained a three-fifths supermajority in the State House of Representatives, the threshold required to pass revenue-related bills.At stake, potentially, was hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue. The three-fifths requirement has allowed the Democratic minority to block Republican tax-cut proposals in the past on the grounds that Mississippi needs the revenue to finance schools and other services. Republicans, who also control the State Senate and governor's mansion, say the cuts, including a proposal to phase out the state's corporate franchise tax, will jump-start the economy and promote job growth.District 79 is a rural chunk of farmland and piney woods about an hour's drive east of Jackson. Mr. Eaton, 48, had not threatened a challenge if he lost, but, like his opponent, was not happy with the way the race was decided.""It's wrong -- philosophically, morally,"" Mr. Eaton said before Friday's drawing. ""It's archaic, it's medieval, and it's wrong. We need a new election."" He repeated the sentiment even after winning and said that he hoped to co-author a bill to change the law that settles some elections by the drawing of lots.The mere fact that the election came to this is one of a long string of disappointments for Southern Democrats, who once ran the region as a virtual one-party zone but whose power has collapsed in recent years. In every state south of Virginia, Republicans control the governor's mansion and both chambers of the legislature. In 2011, Mississippi Republicans won a majority in the State House for the first time since Reconstruction, and increased their numbers in voting this month. If Mr. Tullos had won, he would have been the 74th Republican in the House out of a total of 122 seats.Mr. Eaton, a gregarious and proudly homespun man, met a reporter Wednesday morning at the Huddle House in his hometown, Taylorsville, and tried to make light of the forces of history, and perhaps fate, that appear to be arrayed against him.""If I lose the coin toss, it's going to be kind of like that Hank Williams Jr. song, 'Dinosaur,""' he said, and he recited a few lyrics: ""I should've died a long time before,"" he said.Another line: ""Excuse me, man, but where's the door?""If nothing else, the drawing of straws was a fittingly civilized conclusion to a race that was run with exceeding small-town politesse. The men know each other, and both are well known among the voters in District 79, which encompasses Smith County and part of Jasper County.""I told Bo's wife when I qualified that she'd never hear a bad thing come out of my mouth about her, or her husband, or her family,"" Mr. Tullos said.Mr. Eaton has served in the House for 19 years, occupying a seat formerly held by his grandfather, a pine-belt populist who was also named Blaine Eaton and was known as ""the silver-tongued orator of Sullivan's Hollow.""There were no debates in the contest. Mr. Eaton passed out fliers noting his Southern Baptist church membership and a ""Highest"" rating from the National Rifle Association. In person, he spoke passionately about the need to resist corporate tax cuts, and to expand Medicaid under President Obama's health care law, an idea rejected by Mr. Bryant.After the tie, Mr. Eaton originally said that he hoped to call a special session and change the law. Later, though, he resigned himself to the outcome of Friday's draw.""Look, my life's a gamble,"" he said. ""I'm a farmer. I depend on the weather and the rain. The statute's clear, but my life is not.""Mr. Tullos's law practice is about 20 minutes up the road in the county seat of Raleigh, a small town where many things -- a small park, offices, a dental clinic -- conspicuously bear his family name. He said he went door to door with a campaign that did not emphasize Republican Party talking points so much as a promise to bring more business to the area.Smith County, he said, lacks a retailer where one can buy a decent pair of shoes. ""I want to go to Jackson, and whenever they start talking about economic development, I want to hold up my hand and say, what about this district?"" Mr. Tullos, 51, said before Friday's drawing.Some Democrats wondered whether the Republican-controlled House would be able to impartially judge the matter. On Thursday, Greg Snowden, the Republican House speaker pro tempore, predicted that ""every member of the House will treat this with the utmost seriousness.""""It's not a game,"" he said.Photograph From Left, Gov.

"Gun Violence Leveling Off in New York, Data Show:   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"Despite a wild burst of gunfire that wounded nine people at a party in Brooklyn over the weekend, the number of shootings across New York City was sharply lower last week compared with the same week in 2014, bringing the city effectively even with last year in total amount of gunfire.Through Sunday, there had been 669 shooting episodes reported citywide in 2015 versus 674 at this time last year, Police Department statistics show. Those shootings resulted in 794 people struck by bullets -- virtually the same number at this point last year, when 787 had been struck. The number from this year includes the nine hit, none fatally, at the party in the East New York neighborhood on Sunday.The numbers are a sharp contrast to two months ago, when police commanders noted a rise in shootings and began to flood the most violent precincts with extra officers.Chief James P. O'Neill, the department's highest-ranking uniformed officer, said in June that gun violence was ""our focus"" and pledged to reverse the trend, beginning a summer antiviolence initiative one month early and extending overtime to keep more officers on the streets during high-crime weekend hours.The summer often brings surges in violence. But since early June, shootings have fallen, even as the number of homicides in the city remains 10 percent higher than the historic low from last year -- 196 murders recorded by the police compared with 178 at this point in 2014, according to the preliminary statistics. Three people were killed in gunfire over the weekend.""Having more cops on the street helps, but you can't have cops everywhere,"" said Stephen Davis, the department's top spokesman. ""What we have been doing is targeting some of these groups. Hopefully by targeting the right people, who drive the violence, we reduce the violence.""As an example, Mr. Davis pointed to three separate takedowns last week in the Bronx and Upper Manhattan that resulted in dozens of arrests in connection with shootings and drug sales.The specter of rising violent crime has been an issue for Mayor Bill de Blasio since he took office last year pledging to reform police practices while keeping the streets safe. The level of gunplay remains higher this year than it was in 2013, when shootings hit new lows. But the trend in violence, by the end of July, appears to have flattened out, according to police statistics.""We are the safest big city in America,"" Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a news conference on July 15 when shooting numbers began showing improvement. ""We will continue to be. We will, in fact, go farther.""Policing experts caution against reading too much into the weekly fluctuations in crime data. For example, the final week of July was a particularly bloody one in 2014, with the police recording 40 shootings and 47 people hit. By comparison, last week, a period of relative calm, there were just 18 recorded episodes of gunfire, according to the preliminary statistics.Those episodes included an unusually large number of people struck, 33, including at the backyard party in Brooklyn, where at least two gunmen opened fire, and at a playground in the Bronx, where three people were hit by gunfire early on Sunday. No arrests had been made in either case by late Monday.",0.0
The Logic of an Empty $100 Million Pad:   [SpecialSections ],,"For most investors, a diversified portfolio means a prudent mix of stocks and bonds. For the global elite, diversification increasingly means splurging on New York apartments that can cost tens of millions of dollars, or more.Across Manhattan, real estate developers are scrambling to meet surging demand from buyers around the world who are prepared to pay record-setting prices for new developments with opulent finishes and extraordinary views.These buyers -- some of whom obscure their identities through webs of shell companies-- are not all rushing to call the Big Apple home. Instead, many of them are paying record prices with the expectation that their investments will appreciate, even as they sit empty for most of the year.Last month, the buying frenzy reached new extremes, with one apartment changing hands for more than $100 million.""We've become a global piggy bank,"" said Kirk Henckels, vice chairman of Stribling & Associates.Yet at the upper echelons of the property market, the lines between prudent investing and splashy one-upmanship are inherently blurred.""When you're talking about a bank account that big, diversification is a basic rule of economics and investment,"" Mr. Henckels said. ""It's a wonderful way to justify investing in your toys.""Head-scratching prices aside, New York real estate has proved to be a durable, even lucrative long-term investment. Residential property in Manhattan appreciated 26 percent over the last five years, according to data from the Corcoran Group.That's not bad. But compared to stocks, which have rebounded sharply since the financial crisis, it is subpar. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up more than 75 percent over the same period.Among certain New York properties, though, the appreciation was more striking. New development, which accounts for many of the priciest sales in the city, is up 52 percent over the last five years, Corcoran says. And at the highest end of the market, returns outperformed almost all other asset classes. In 2013, properties that changed hands for more than $9.5 million gave their sellers an average 32 percent profit, according to StreetEasy.""When you study the values of New York real estate, whether it's five or 10 or 20 years, the story says buy,"" said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group.A major factor feeding the sudden buying binge is a flood of new properties that cater to the top tier of global buyers.Half a dozen residential skyscrapers are sprouting in Midtown Manhattan, each promising views, amenities and materials fit for kings and queens.One57, the first completed, has sold most of its units, including the city's first $100 million apartment. Further east, the gridlike facade of 432 Park Avenue already looms over Midtown, its perfectly square windows making it the city's newest architectural statement. Both buildings offer full-floor palaces high in the sky.""Years ago we didn't have these kinds of properties,"" Ms. Liebman said. ""But savvy developers realized that if you build it, they will come.""Even more new residential skyscrapers will soon cast long shadows over the city. The skinniest of the bunch will be erected above the Steinway piano building on West 57th Street, in what has become known as Billionaires' Row.Nearby, a tower next to the Museum of Modern Art, designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel, is on the road to construction. So is 220 Central Park South, a limestone spire designed by Robert A. M. Stern. Around the city, other projects will compete for attention and dollars.It's not that the city lacked inventory. It has the most expensive real estate market in the country, with thousands of multimillion-dollar apartments, townhouses and mansions changing hands regularly.But as tastes changed, apartments that once appeared palatial now seem pedestrian. Today's new construction includes floor-to-ceiling windows, full-floor residences, opulent finishes and amenities like room service from Michelin-starred chefs.""For the superwealthy who are used to five- or six-star hotel services around the world, it's a really great way to not just travel now, but to live,"" Ms. Liebman said.Putting a price on such trophy properties is no science. ""Art is a closer analogy than stocks or bonds,"" said Christopher J. Mayer, a real estate professor at Columbia University. ""What matters is the amount of this stuff available and the number of people looking at it.""And to explain why buyers will pay such soaring prices, brokers often resort to metaphors, not mathematics.""How else do you explain $10,000 a square foot?"" said Mr. Henckels at Stribling & Associates. ""It's the same thing with the price for carats of a pink diamond or square inches of a Warhol.""At least one buyer appears to believe that his new residence is an actual work of art. William A. Ackman, the hedge fund manager who bought a penthouse at One57 as an investment that he plans to keep empty save for the occasional event, called his $90 million party pad ""the Mona Lisa of apartments.""However, the Mona Lisa is one of the most reproduced artworks in the world. And as more such towers rise around Manhattan, the views and floor plans for which Mr. Ackman and others are paying top dollar may not be unique.""There's more space on Park Avenue than there are billionaires who want to live in New York,"" Mr. Mayer said. ""Unlike Picassos, there is not a finite number of these properties.""Even Ms. Liebman, whose company represents sponsors of several new buildings, acknowledges that the market is becoming crowded. ""There will be winners and losers,"" Ms. Liebman said. ""Some buildings are better than others. Savvy buyers will play the buildings against each other.""For now, however, demand is not ebbing. Foreign buyers continue to view New York real estate as a safe place to park money, keeping inventory tight and demand high.""We have the greatest influx of foreign buyers that we've ever seen,"" Ms. Liebman said. ""The Chinese have made a huge impact on New York real estate along with Latin, European, Russian buyers. The past year has brought us a lot of Middle Eastern buyers.""For these buyers -- oligarchs, international corporate chieftains and foreign royalty -- who make up an estimated 30 to 50 percent of high-end buyers, there are various allures to Manhattan property.""It's a repository of money, it's in the dollar currency, and it's in New York City,"" said Gary Barnett, president of Extell Development Company, whose projects include One57.Currency fluctuations, unpredictable world affairs and unstable governments contribute to the desire for a safe haven.""It can be a good idea to have money outside your home markets,"" Mr. Henckels said. ""Hardly any of these people are actually New York City residents.""Yet a market reliant on a small cadre of the world's richest men and women can also be fragile. ""A 50 percent drop in the price of oil is a huge risk,"" said Mr. Mayer of Columbia. ""A significant number of the world's billionaires rely on oil.""Believers in the ever-rising tide of property values point to a notable resale at One57. Last May, a Chicago-based investor bought a three-bedroom apartment for $30.6 million. In October, the unit was sold to a hedge fund manager for $34 million. That quick profit -- an appreciation of 11 percent in less than half a year -- made it one of the better investments of 2014. ""The perception is that if you're getting in on Day 1, you're almost guaranteed to see price increases,"" Ms. Liebman said.But the higher the price, the more elusive the potential returns. If an apartment sold for $100 million today were to enjoy the same appreciation as the first resale at One57, it would trade hands for $111 million later this year. ""I'm skeptical from here about how much appreciation there can be,"" Mr. Mayer said.And with so many other trophy properties coming to market, it is unclear if Mr. Ackman or others like him will be able to find a buyer soon.""I am concerned,"" Mr. Henckels said. ""The biggest question is, have we overbuilt luxury inventory, and I don't know the answer.""Of course, this is not the first time that speculators have bet on Manhattan property or that critics have grumbled about a bubble. In the years before the financial crisis, two marquee properties hit the market and broke records. New construction at 15 Central Park West attracted prominent buyers looking for pristine new construction. And condominium conversions at the Plaza Hotel overlooking Central Park proved alluring to moneyed buyers looking for a piece of old New York.At the time, critics thought buyers were overpaying and prices would never go higher. But over the last eight years, prices in those buildings have continued to rise. ""Look at the profits people have made there,"" Mr. Henckels said.At a certain point, however, logic fails to explain what are ultimately emotional decisions, and real estate experts again turn to the art world for explanations. ""These guys will buy a $50 million to $100 million painting and put it on their wall,"" Mr. Barnett said. ""Or you can buy a $50- to $100-million piece of real estate that is probably more unique, and no one can steal it from you. Some people actually think that way.""Photograph Lofty Living: Two of the New Residential Skyscrapers in New York Provide Striking Views.

Stacking Bricks and Stones to the Sky in a City of Glass Towers:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"A neat little row of bricks and stone blocks sits on a worktable inside the TriBeCa offices of the development firm DDG. Some are classic red, others ivory white; a few resemble smoke, a ghost of their birth in the kiln.""Each brick has a fingerprint,"" said Joe McMillan, chief executive and co-founder of the six-year-old firm.He was not being poetic, at least not entirely. On the top of each 21-inch brick is a pair of thumbprints, a reminder that each one was pressed from a wooden mold by an actual person in Broager, a small seaside town in Denmark where the bricks have been made in this fashion by the Petersen brick company since 1791.""The crazy thing is, no one is ever even going to see that print once it's been set,"" Mr. McMillan said. ""But just knowing they are there, it gives you a sense of how much care went into each brick.""And by hand-laying those bricks -- a nearly lost art -- DDG hopes to show how much care goes into each of its buildings.With everything growing slick, streamlined and interconnected the past few decades, both in construction and in life, DDG's zeal for mortared joints happened almost by coincidence, more through a bond with craft than a love of bricks. Yet the attraction has been just as strong for luxury buyers who want everything in life to be tailored.Whether it is a boutique TriBeCa loft building that looks as if it pushed its way out of the earth or a 521-foot tower with nearly 600,000 hand-laid bricks on the Upper East Side, DDG has a way with mortar that is at once contemporary and recalls the earliest days of cities, which masonry made possible.""I think we're finally over the stripped-down modernist boxes, and we're searching for something with more intrinsic values,"" Peter Guthrie, DDG's head of design and construction, said. (Unlike most developers, the firm does both in-house, part of the reason its work can be so exacting.)He and Mr. McMillan could spend hours talking about bricks, discussing and dissecting them the way some people do wine or literature. The patina, the heft, the hue, the character, even the philosophy of construction are popular topics around the office.This may sound strange, but it is doubly so given how most brick buildings are assembled these days, whether a four-story townhouse or a 40-story tower.After the great fire of 1835, New York mandated that all buildings be made from noncombustible materials. Suddenly the clay-lined shores of the Hudson Valley became a gold mine. ""It became one of the greatest brick industries known to man, almost all of it feeding the growth of New York,"" said Richard Pieper, director of preservation at Jan Hird Pokorny Associates, an architecture firm specializing in historic restoration work.For more than a century, there was an explosion of red brick, brownstone, terra cotta and limestone construction around the region. Even once skyscrapers started rising on their iron and steel frames, bricks played an important role -- the Empire State Building, though clad in stone, has more than 10 million bricks invisibly lining its structure as fireproofing.After World War II, companies like Alcoa and United States Steel looked for ways to put their factories to use building things other than tanks and planes, which spurred aluminum panels and glass curtain walls. Yet New York resisted the modernist urge for some time, at least for residential buildings.After all, the great prewar architects Rosario Candela, J.E.R. Carpenter and Emery Roth had divined the concept of the apartment house, ushering in high-rise living with their great piles of limestone and brick lining Central Park and Park Avenue. The midcentury mode was seen in the white brick behemoth of Manhattan House on East 66th Street and its myriad imitators. But then Richard Meier's glass towers on Perry Street seemed to change that forever.""It just took over in the 2000s,"" Carol Willis, director of the Skyscraper Museum, said of the boom in crystalline construction. ""Somehow glass came to symbolize luxury and first-class construction, even if that wasn't always the case.""Even when developers still use bricks, they have all but abandoned bricklaying in favor of what is known as ""panelization."" Inside factories across the Midwest and China, bricks or stone blocks are arranged into panels many feet or stories in dimension. They are then shipped to the site and hoisted into place, often exposing seams. Panels are even used in modern masonry marvels like 15 Central Park West.Into this void stepped DDG in 2009. The firm's first project was 41 Bond Street, on the blockbuster block of NoHo already home to the work of Herzog & de Meuron, Deborah Berke and BKSK.Given the neighborhood's fabric of cobblestones and Romanesque Revival loft buildings -- and the fact that it was a landmark district -- the firm decided that a hand-laid facade would be most fitting. Rather than brick, though, it settled on slender, undulating bluestone blocks. A local material more common in Brooklyn sidewalks, here it got a modern treatment with deeply grooved window frames. (As with all their projects, the masonry is not structural, but merely decorative, and largely made possible by the firm's employing its own masons.)Two years later, the firm turned to the Danish bricks for an 11-story project on 14th Street just off Ninth Avenue, on the border of the meatpacking district. The zippered corners and mottled coloration of the white bricks could have been achieved with panels, but it would have shown not only on the outside, but also within, given the deeply recessed windows. It is for that same reason DDG will lay all those bricks on the Upper East Side, at the corner of Third Avenue and 88th Street -- 593,989 to be exact, by Mr. McMillan's calculation.""We considered doing panels after the first hundred feet or so, because you'd think you couldn't tell,"" he said. ""But you know where you could? From inside the apartments.""On a newly proposed project on Franklin Street in TriBeCa, DDG tried to branch out with a mostly glass facade with brick accents. The property is in a historic district, though, and the community board was emphatic, so back came the bricks, though again with modern flourishes, in this case subtle perforations in the pattern.At 12 Warren Street, a 13-unit development that is the firm's latest, the designers turned again to bluestone. No two blocks are the same, and while most are a foot or two long, some are the size of small boulders and weigh many tons. All the pieces were arranged in a yard, tagged, and then put into place in the city.Passers-by could be forgiven for thinking they had always been there.",0.0

"Biden Is Taking Steps Toward '16, Supporters Say:   [National Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDED. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his associates have begun to actively explore a possible presidential campaign, which would upend the Democratic field and deliver a direct threat to Hillary Rodham Clinton, several people who have spoken to Mr. Biden or his closest advisers say.Mr. Biden's advisers have started to reach out to Democratic leaders and donors who have not yet committed to Mrs. Clinton or who have grown concerned about what they see as her increasingly visible vulnerabilities as a candidate.The conversations, often fielded by Mr. Biden's chief of staff, Steve Ricchetti, have taken place through hushed phone calls and quiet lunches. In most cases, they have grown out of an outpouring of sympathy for Mr. Biden since the death of his son Beau, 46, in May.On Saturday, the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd reported that Mr. Biden had been holding meetings at his residence, ""talking to friends, family and donors about jumping in"" to challenge Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two nominating states.One longtime Biden supporter said the vice president had been deeply moved by his son's desire for him to run.""He was so close to Beau and it was so heartbreaking that, frankly, I thought initially he wouldn't have the heart,"" the supporter, Michael Thornton, a Boston lawyer, said in an interview. ""But I've had indications that maybe he does want to -- and 'that's what Beau would have wanted me to do.' ""Mr. Biden's path, should he run, would not be easy. Mrs. Clinton has enormous support among Democrats inspired by the idea of electing a woman as president, and her campaign has already raised millions of dollars.Additionally, Mr. Biden, who is 72, has in the past proved to be prone to embarrassing gaffes on the campaign trail. He would also face the critical task of building a field operation.One Democrat with direct knowledge of the conversations described the outreach as a heady combination of donors and friends of Mr. Biden's wanting to prop him up in his darkest hours, and of recent polls showing Mrs. Clinton's support among independents declining, suggesting there could be a path to the nomination for the vice president.Ms. Dowd reported that as Beau Biden faced brain cancer, he ""tried to make his father promise to run, arguing that the White House should not revert to the Clintons and that the country would be better off with Biden values."" Mr. Biden's other son, Hunter, also encouraged him to run, she wrote.The support Mr. Biden has garnered speaks to growing concerns among Democrats that Mrs. Clinton could lose in Iowa and New Hampshire, as the populist message of one of her opponents, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, draws swelling crowds.""The reality is it's going to be a tough, even-steven kind of race, and there's that moment when a lot of party establishment would start exactly this kind of rumble: 'Is there anybody else?' "" said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist.At the same time, the slow trickle of news about Mrs. Clinton's use of private email when she was secretary of state, and the coming Benghazi hearings, may be distracting some voters from the core message of her campaign: the need to lift the middle class.""It's not that we dislike Hillary, it's that we want to win the White House,"" said Richard A. Harpootlian, a lawyer and Democratic donor in Columbia, S.C., who met with Mr. Ricchetti before Beau Biden died. ""We have a better chance of doing that with somebody who is not going to have all the distractions of a Clinton campaign.""A spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign declined to comment.In a July 30 Quinnipiac poll, 57 percent of voters said Mrs. Clinton was not honest and trustworthy, and 52 percent said she did not care about their needs or problems. The same poll showed Mr. Biden with his highest favorability rating, 49 percent, in seven years, with 58 percent saying he was honest and trustworthy and 57 percent saying he cared about them. But Mrs. Clinton's numbers are still strong, especially among likely Democratic primary voters.""The No. 1 thing voters want is a candidate who is honest and trustworthy, and the veep is leading in those polls,"" said William Pierce, executive director of Draft Biden, a ""super PAC"" that is trying to build enthusiasm for a possible candidacy.Mr. Biden could still decide not to run. Confidants say they expect him to make something official by early September. Other than by not ruling out a run, and by holding preliminary meetings, he has not openly fueled speculation about his candidacy. As of Saturday, he had no trips planned to Iowa or New Hampshire in the coming weeks. But an intermediary recruited by the vice president's office has been in touch with potential staff members who have not yet signed on to the Clinton campaign.Kendra Barkoff, a Biden spokeswoman, said, ""As the Biden family continues to go through this difficult time, the vice president is focused on his family and immersed in his work.""A 2016 run would be the third time Mr. Biden, a longtime senator from Delaware, had sought the presidency, which friends say is his ultimate dream.Mr. Biden's first campaign in 1988 ended in heartbreak after news reports that he plagiarized parts of a speech and exaggerated his academic record forced him to drop out. In 2008, he drew less than 1 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses and dropped out after making controversial comments about Barack Obama, then seeking his first term in the White House. Mr. Biden said he was ""the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean.""Mr. Obama later chose Mr. Biden as his running mate. In the early months of the 2016 campaign, the president has been careful not to undermine or wholeheartedly endorse either his former secretary of state or his vice president.""The president has said that the best political decision he's ever made in his career has been to ask Joe Biden to run as his vice president,"" Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, said last week.Friends described Mr. Biden's relationship with Mrs. Clinton in the Senate as cordial and warm. But in his long career in Democratic politics, Mr. Biden has clashed with former President Bill Clinton, and his relationship with Mrs. Clinton has not been without awkwardness. One close Biden confidant, Ron Klain, has been in contact with Mrs. Clinton's campaign about helping her prepare for the Democratic debates, a sign some people interpreted as evidence that Mr. Biden would decide against a run.Mr. Ricchetti, a White House aide in the Clinton administration who is now Mr. Biden's chief of staff, began talking to donors and supporters in the months before Beau Biden died.In recent weeks, those talks, with local elected officials and party leaders, started again, mostly because well-wishers were calling to check on the Biden family. The talk inevitably drifted to 2016, and many of these Democrats urged Mr. Biden to seriously consider getting into the race, said people with knowledge of the talks who agreed to discuss private conversations only anonymously.Mr. Ricchetti declined to comment.The speculation intensified on Thursday when friends of Mrs. Clinton's spotted Mr. Ricchetti having breakfast at the Four Seasons in Washington with Louis B. Susman, a major donor and former ambassador to Britain. Fox News reported on the meeting.Mr. Susman -- who has already made the maximum donation allowed in the primary, $2,700, to Mrs. Clinton's campaign, and who is a longtime friend of the Biden family -- dismissed any implication that he was discussing the vice president's plans. ""He wasn't testing the waters with me,"" Mr. Susman said of Mr. Ricchetti. ""There was never any discussion of the presidential campaign or money.""Mr. Biden is by no means a virtuoso campaigner. But his entry into the race would add an unbridled, often unscripted passion for the presidency that some Democrats say the ever-cautious Mrs. Clinton at times lacks.One Democratic donor with direct knowledge of the overtures from the Biden camp said Mr. Biden had already thought about how he would position himself in the race, delivering an economic message to the left of Mrs. Clinton's while embracing Obama administration policies, like health care reform, that are widely popular among Democrats.Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.",0.0
Niger Adds Its Troops to the War on Boko Haram:   [Foreign Desk ],,"DAKAR, Senegal -- With the regional war against the Boko Haram militant group widening, Niger's Parliament has agreed to send troops across the border to join the fight.The vote was unanimous in the National Assembly on Monday night, reflecting the shock produced by at least four attacks in Niger in less than a week, including an explosion at a market in the country's east that killed a number of civilians.Chad, Cameroon and Benin have also agreed to contribute troops to an 8,700-member force to fight Boko Haram. Attacks by the militant group, which is based in Nigeria, have increasingly spilled across borders in the region.Nigeria's war has spread to its smaller, poorer neighbor, Niger. In Diffa, the main city in the country's far east, just across the border from Nigeria, ""people are in a panic,"" the head of the Red Cross in Diffa, Abdullai Adah, said by phone on Tuesday, after a bombing at a vegetable market and an attack on the city's prison the day before. At least eight were killed, Mr. Adah said.""Everybody is shut up at home,"" he said. ""All the stores are closed. And we are hearing heavy artillery from the Nigeria side.""The civil prison in Diffa that Boko Haram struck held militants and their sympathizers, according to a regional news site, Sahelien.com. The site quoted residents as saying that they had heard armed men calling ""Allahu akbar"" from pickup trucks as the prison was attacked -- a cry that also resounds from three newly released Boko Haram propaganda videos this week.The National Assembly's vote in Niger's capital, Niamey, 850 miles away, followed the attacks in Diffa within hours.""People are worried,"" said a leading political scientist in the capital, Mahaman Tidjani Alou.""That there are bombs in Niger, this is something totally unprecedented,"" said Mr. Alou, speaking by phone on Tuesday. ""It's clear that this is not just at our doorstep now. It is inside the country.""Niger, a country where American and French drones are based, has been attacked previously by Al Qaeda's African affiliate in its desert north. It now finds itself under attack on its southern edge by a different group of Islamist extremists.""Niger has had a very clear position in relation to Boko Haram, and it is equally clear that this position can have consequences,"" Mr. Alou said. ""It's the state itself that has been attacked, the symbols of authority. The state can't simply allow that.""Diffa, only about 100 miles from the Nigerian city that spawned Boko Haram, Maiduguri, was penetrated as long ago as the early 2000s by the radical Islamist ideology on which the sect was nurtured, a French specialist on Boko Haram, Marc-Antoine Pérouse de Montclos, said in a new study.Extremist preachers struggled for influence in the city before being chased from Diffa's central mosque in 2007, Mr. de Montclos wrote. Yet the dusty, low-slung market town was thought by specialists to have been penetrated by Boko Haram cells and to have provided a safe haven for the militants even as they were attacking Nigerians across the border.As the vote wrapped up in Niamey late Monday night, the National Assembly speaker, Amadou Salifou, said there had been a ""collective recognition of the gravity of the situation,"" according to the state news service.With attacks on Boko Haram now coming from the militaries of four countries -- Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria -- the group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, released a video this week on YouTube in which he mocked the forces arrayed against him, especially Chad's.""You sent 7,000 of your soldiers. Why didn't you send seven million?"" he said in the video, according to a translation by the terrorism monitoring group SITE. ""Only 7,000? By Allah, it is small. We can capture them in an attempt or two.""",0.0

The N.F.L. Suspension That Started Them All:   [Sports Desk ],,"In 1925, four high school students, recruited by a star athlete, tried to blend in as professional players during an N.F.L. game in Chicago.The students were, in the end, noticed -- resulting in what is believed to be the N.F.L.'s first suspension. And coming 90 years before the New England Patriots' ball-inflation scandal, that case involving the high school ringers set a precedent for all peculiar N.F.L. scandals and suspensions to come.N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell last week upheld Tom Brady's four-game suspension for his role in the Patriots' use of underinflated footballs in the A.F.C. championship game last season, eliciting much discussion on how the league metes out justice for its players.But in 1925, five years after the league was founded as the American Professional Football Association, a four-game sentence would have seemed lenient.Art Folz, a player for the Chicago Cardinals, was initially barred from the league for life for persuading the four high school players -- Charles Richardson, William Thompson, Jack Daniels and James Snyder -- to play on an opposing team for one game. Ambrose McGuirk, the owner of that team, the Milwaukee Badgers, was forced to sell the franchise in the wake of the incident.In 1925, the Cardinals were in a tight race for first place with the Pottsville Maroons, and to pad their record, the owner Chris O'Brien organized a game for Dec. 10 at Normal Park against Milwaukee, which was 0-6 that year. In the early years of the N.F.L., teams could add to their schedules up until late December, and O'Brien exercised that right.But O'Brien was concerned that the Badgers, who had already disbanded for the season, would not be able to scrap together enough players.""The next day or so I remarked: 'I wonder if McGuirk will come through with a team all right,' "" he wrote in The Chicago Daily Tribune on Dec. 17, 1925, in an explanation that appeared on the front page of the sports section under the banner headline ""Pros Tell Full Story of Prep Scandal.""""That remark was overheard by one of my players, Art Folz. He said perhaps he could pick up some players if extras were needed.""Folz -- described by the sportswriter Robert Pruter as ""one of the most talented quarterbacks ever produced by the city"" -- initially thought of asking two of his former Englewood High School teammates who had been playing professionally in Chicago.""Never once did I think of going to high school players,"" Folz wrote in The Tribune.But two days before the game, he did just that: After he was unable to meet with the professional players, Folz wrote, he ""just happened to drop into the Englewood high school to chat with the boys.""The idea of asking some of the high school players to round out Milwaukee's roster popped into his head. With the game scheduled for a Thursday afternoon, Folz thought there would be no crowd or price of admission, so the high school players' amateur status would not be affected.""I mentioned it, and they were eager to play,"" Folz wrote. ""They seemed to think it would be quite a stunt.""The students, according to a Dec. 24, 1925, article in The Tribune, played ""because they were led into it, believing it was a practice contest, and they wanted to learn some of the fine points of the game from the big pro stars."" They, like Folz, did not think their participation would hurt their amateur standing, the article said.Pruter, who has written extensively about Chicago high school sports, said that the N.F.L. was so young that the differences between high school football and professional football were not nearly as stark as they are today. Folz, a top N.F.L. player, was listed as 5 feet 7 and 157 pounds.""The professional league was still a baby at that time,"" Pruter said. ""I don't think it was that huge of a leap.""And so, when game day arrived, so did the four high school students.According to an Associated Press article published in The New York Times on Dec. 24, 1925, the four boys said they told their parents the night before about their involvement in the game. They also said that they were introduced to the other players under their own names and that they even used their Englewood High School signals.Folz wrote that he distributed Badgers jerseys to the boys, turned them over to McGuirk and ""never thought anything more about it.""""I was somewhat surprised to see there was quite a crowd of spectators at the game,"" he added.Those fans saw a demolition. Chicago, powered by Folz's four touchdowns, won by 59-0.""They were creamed,"" Pruter said of the Badgers. ""It was embarrassing. It was an embarrassing win.""It got worse, for pretty much everyone involved. Joseph Carr, the league president, was in the hospital at the time, recuperating from appendicitis, according to the biography ""The Man Who Built the National Football League: Joe F. Carr"" by Chris Willis.In addition to barring Folz for life, Carr fined the Cardinals $1,000 (about $13,600 in 2015 dollars), put them on probation for one year, fined the Badgers $500 and ordered McGuirk to sell the team within 90 days. (The Badgers ended up folding as a franchise after the 1926 season.)In his state-of-the-league address the next February, Carr said that the incident ""threatened to tear the very foundation from under our league,"" according to the biography, which also said Carr's penalties were ""universally praised across the country.""The high school players were initially barred from athletics for having played against professional players, which represented a violation of amateurism. Perhaps such a young and uncertain league needed Carr's severe punishment, especially given the nature of the scandal: a professional athlete persuading four young players to join an opposing team, for the sake of pursuing a championship.The newspapers painted a picture of ""vile professionals"" luring innocent high school students ""into trouble with lies and deception,"" according to the book ""Shaping College Football: The Transformation of an American Sport, 1919-1930"" by Raymond Schmidt.Folz, for his part, expressed tremendous regret and accepted all blame.""I am heartbroken over it and would do anything in the world to get them back, because those boys were blameless in the affair,"" Folz wrote in The Tribune.Whether his remorse played a role in what happened later is unknown. O'Brien's fine was retracted and Folz's lifetime ban revoked, though he did not return to professional football. The high school players were forgiven, and Richardson and Thompson even earned all-star honors at the end of the season.And after another N.F.L. scandal in December 1925 -- this one involving territorial rights and ending with Carr's suspension of the Pottsville Maroons -- the Chicago Cardinals were named league champions.There is hope for Brady yet.Photograph The Chicago Cardinals Playing Against the Chicago Bears in 1925.

"Manuel Contreras, Chilean Spy Chief, Dies at 86:   [Obituary (Obit); Biography ]",,"SANTIAGO, Chile -- Gen. Manuel Contreras, Chile's intelligence chief during the military dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, died on Friday in the military hospital in Santiago while serving 526 years of multiple prison terms for human rights violations. He was 86.General Contreras, who had colon cancer and advanced diabetes, spent the past 20 years in two special military detention centers, one of which more resembled a resort, as judges piled on almost 60 prison sentences for crimes committed by the National Intelligence Directorate, or DINA, the secret intelligence agency he directed from 1973 to 1977. Appeals were pending in dozens of other cases.After the announcement of his death, dozens of people gathered outside the hospital to celebrate, chanting and opening bottles of Champagne. Dozens of others did the same in Plaza Italia, near downtown Santiago. Some waved Chilean flags and held up pictures of people who had disappeared after General Pinochet's coup in 1973 that overthrew President Salvador Allende. One woman held a sign saying, ""Happy trip to hell, assassin.""DINA, which was established weeks after the coup, operated clandestine detention and torture centers across the country and had been found responsible for most human rights abuses during General Pinochet's 17-year dictatorship. Official human rights reports estimated that more than 3,200 people were executed or never found after being seized, and almost 38,000 were imprisoned and tortured during that period.General Contreras wielded unbridled power to eliminate political opposition and have his agents infiltrate all echelons of society, including government offices, as well as Chilean exile groups. He often boasted that he reported solely to General Pinochet. In the most recent decisions against him, on July 29, judges sentenced General Contreras, who had retired from the military, to 15 years for the disappearance in 1974 of a university student and 20 years for the murder in 1975 of six members of a family, including a pregnant woman. Imprisoned in a DINA torture center, some of those victims had their eyes gouged out, and others were burned with boiling oil or water, according to the investigation.A C.I.A. report released in 2000 said that by April 1975 it had become clear that ""Contreras was the principal obstacle to a reasonable human rights policy within the Junta."" Nevertheless, weeks later, ""elements within the C.I.A. recommended establishing a paid relationship with Contreras to obtain intelligence based on his unique position and access to Pinochet."" The suggestion was overruled, the report said, but ""given miscommunications in the timing of this exchange, a one-time payment was given to Contreras.""General Contreras never admitted to any of his crimes. In his last televised interview in 2013 by CNN Chile, he was defiant and completely unrepentant, denying that any prisoner had ever disappeared, saying that ""they are all in the General Cemetery.""""In the approximately 25 human rights cases related to the DINA in which I have taken part, Contreras never cooperated or provided any truthful information,"" said Francisco Ugas, executive secretary of the Interior Ministry's Human Rights Program, which has served as a plaintiff in a number of judicial investigations.Manuel Contreras was born on May 4, 1929, in Santiago. He is survived by his wife Nélida Gutiérrez and one son and three daughters from a previous marriage. As the director of DINA, he orchestrated a secret alliance known as Operation Condor among the intelligence services of the military governments in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia in the 1970s. It involved intelligence-sharing and coordinated operations to capture, interrogate, torture and exchange prisoners in Condor member countries and carry out assassinations abroad, one of them in the United States.On Sept. 21, 1976, a bomb planted by DINA operatives under the car of Chile's former ambassador to the United States, Orlando Letelier, killed Mr. Letelier and an American colleague, Ronni Moffitt, in Washington.An F.B.I. investigation traced the crime to DINA, and under pressure from the Carter administration, the Chilean government in 1978 handed over to the United States an American citizen Michael V. Townley, a DINA agent involved in the murders. Mr. Townley served a short prison term and was enrolled in the witness protection program.""Manuel Contreras will go down in history as a criminal and will always be remembered as a criminal,"" said Senator Juan Pablo Letelier, the son of Orlando Letelier.In 1978, a grand jury in Washington indicted General Contreras; his deputy, Pedro Espinoza; and another DINA agent, Armando Fernández Larios, and sought their extradition for the Letelier-Moffitt murders. Chile's Supreme Court denied the request, but in 1987, Mr. Fernández surrendered to American officials and reached a plea bargain. Mr. Fernández currently lives in Miami.Photograph Gen.

Slow to Save Salamanders:   [Science Desk ],,"We humans can drive species toward extinction by hunting them or destroying their habitat. But we can also threaten them in a more subtle but no less dangerous way: by making them sick.In the early 1900s, humans introduced malaria-spreading mosquitoes to Hawaii, and many native bird species were decimated. More recently, a fungus introduced to the United States from Europe has proved lethal to several species of bats.Now, scientists and wildlife managers are struggling to prevent the next infectious disaster. A recently discovered fungus is killing salamanders in Europe. It is likely spread by the pet trade and could soon arrive in North America, home to about half of all salamander species.For months, biologists have been calling for a halt to the trade in pet salamanders so they can mount a defense against the fungus. But federal officials have yet to take action.""You would think there would be something in place,"" said Vance T. Vredenburg, a biologist at San Francisco State University. ""We really need a government agency at some level to take action and do something.""Dr. Vredenburg and his colleagues have already seen what a fungal infection can do to amphibians. In the 1990s, they discovered that Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd for short) was wiping out entire populations of frogs. Humans have spread Bd around the world, and now it threatens hundreds of species with extinction.""People really didn't believe that something could happen that was so bad,"" Dr. Vredenburg said. ""I really don't want to see that happen again.""In 2013, unfortunately, scientists in the Netherlands discovered that a related species of fungus, called Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, or Bsal, was killing fire salamanders. Since then, they have also found it in Belgium and Britain.Having seen what Bd could do, researchers scrambled to understand Bsal better. Three species of Asian salamanders that are popular as pets can carry the fungus without getting sick, they found. It is likely that the pet trade is spreading Bsal to wild salamanders in Europe, which have not developed resistance to the disease.Researchers in North America have been looking for Bsal, and so far have not found any trace of it. But based on a study of North American salamanders, published Thursday in the journal Science, Dr. Vredenburg and his colleagues predict that some regions of the continent are at high risk of an outbreak.""It shows a terrible picture,"" Dr. Vredenburg said.The pet trade brings huge numbers of salamanders into the United States. Fish and Wildlife Service records show that about 780,000 salamanders were imported from 2010 to 2014. Dr. Vredenburg and his colleagues found that 98 percent of the imported animals were native to Asia.In Asia, Bsal-carrying salamanders tend to live in cool, moist climates. Dr. Vredenburg and his colleagues identified several regions in North America with the same conditions where the fungus should grow well. Some of these regions are home to a high diversity of salamanders.The scientists identified three regions as particularly hospitable to Bsal: the Southeast, the Pacific Northwest and Sierra Nevadas, and the highlands of central Mexico.Dr. Vredenburg sees an additional threat to salamanders in these areas: Some regional cities, such as San Francisco and Atlanta, are arrival points for imported salamanders.Because Bsal was discovered only two years ago, scientists still have a lot to learn about it. The fungus may grow in a wider range of conditions than currently known, for example. Discovering new host species in Asia could help scientists better predict where else Bsal could thrive in North America.Karen R. Lips, a biologist at the University of Maryland, agrees with Dr. Vredenburg that the United States should ban imported pet salamanders, at least until scientists can figure out the scale of the Bsal threat and come up with a plan for blocking it.It might become possible, for example, to test imported salamanders for Bsal and disinfect animals carrying the fungus. ""The longer we can keep things out, the better chance we'll have of putting a plan in place,"" Dr. Lips said.The Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council supports a temporary halt in salamander imports. ""A moratorium on importation of Bsal-susceptible salamanders should be put into place until such time as effective testing and treatment regimens have been developed,"" Robert Likins, the council's director of governmental affairs, wrote in an email.The Fish and Wildlife Service can stop the import of ""injurious wildlife"" under a law known as the Lacey Act. This spring, the service announced that it would evaluate pet salamanders for their risk of introducing Bsal. That process is inching along.""The act does not include a provision to list injurious species on an emergency basis,"" said Laury Marshall Parramore, a spokeswoman for the service.Priya Nanjappa of the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies said that the Bsal experience showed how badly we need new laws allowing the government to respond effectively to emerging wildlife diseases.""It's demonstrating that even when we have the foresight, we're still stumbling,"" she said.Photograph Salamanders in the Pacific Northwest, Like This Western Red-Backed, May Be Vulnerable to a Fungus That has Decimated European Salamanders and Could Come to the United States.

Bush Campaign Sees Upside to Trump's Surge in the G.O.P.:   [National Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- It may be the Summer of Trump, but the publicity-hungry real estate magnate is not the only Republican presidential candidate relishing all his attention.Donald J. Trump's surge in the polls has been met with barely concealed delight by Jeb Bush and his supporters. Mr. Trump's bombastic ways have simultaneously made it all but impossible for those vying to be the alternative to Mr. Bush to emerge, and easier for Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, to position himself as the serious and thoughtful alternative to a candidate who has upended the early nominating process.With little indication that his support is slipping and the promise of the center stage at Thursday's debate, Mr. Trump has essentially frozen the rest of the field.""The longer it goes, the greater the panic is going to build,"" said Alex Castellanos, a longtime Republican strategist. ""And that means you may not have the luxury to flirt with an undeveloped, budding candidate. Trump has set the Republican Party on fire, and if you're going to put that fire out you don't have time to waste. You're going to have to grab the biggest blanket you got and throw it, and right now that's Jeb.""Many Republican officials, while acknowledging that Mr. Trump has tapped into the current of anti-establishment anger, believe he has little chance to ultimately win the nomination. The broad attention given to his position atop national polls overshadows more worrisome indicators for him, including the substantial number of potential primary voters who say they would not support him under any circumstances.But for the moment he is depriving many of the other 16 Republican candidates of the political oxygen they need to win attention from grass-roots supporters in early nominating states and commitments from fence-riding donors.That mainly helps Mr. Bush, who can quietly continue to build his daunting advantages in money and organization while his would-be challengers struggle to break through.The frustration among those other aspirants is beginning to spill into public.""I think this is a temporary loss of sanity,"" Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said on CNN Thursday of Mr. Trump's support, adding: ""If you would give some other candidates time from 8 in the morning to 8 at night all day long for three weeks, I'm guessing some other candidates might rise as well.""Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey could barely contain his exasperation when asked about Mr. Trump's claim that he would not only build a wall on the Mexican border but would even have Mexico pay for it.""When you do that, it hurts the credibility of the presidency,"" Mr. Christie said on CNBC.A Monmouth University poll of New Hampshire voters released last week emphasized the problem for them: With Mr. Trump in the race, Mr. Christie drew 4 percent and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin 7 percent. But the same poll showed that, if Mr. Trump were to drop out, Mr. Christie would pick up 15 percent of Trump voters, and Mr. Walker 14 percent.In Iowa, a crucial state for Mr. Walker, Mr. Trump is now statistically tied with him, according to an NBC Marist poll of potential Republican caucusgoers.Mr. Bush's enthusiasts, meanwhile, are all but giddy, even though it would be much better if he were simply dominating the field.""You got to give Trump credit,"" Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said with a grin. ""He's really created a firestorm here. Because he is such a controversial character, and an interesting one at that, it's taken away opportunities for an awful lot of others to break through."" At the same time, Mr. Hatch said, Mr. Bush ""comes across as the one guy you can rely on.""Mr. Bush has been openly critical of Mr. Trump and ""the vitriol that he's spewing out these days,"" while being increasingly emphatic about the need for Republicans to embrace a more optimistic and inclusive message. It is a theme aimed not just at the general electorate, but also at Republican primary voters eager to back a candidate who can generate broad appeal and win the White House.""We have to campaign all across this country with joy in our heart rather than anger,"" Mr. Bush said in suburban Orlando last week, vowing to a heavily white crowd that he would campaign in minority communities and on college campuses -- ""places where Republicans haven't been seen in a long, long while.""Mr. Bush's campaign is aggressively highlighting these efforts. He began last week speaking before a diverse group of pastors in Orlando, which has a fast-growing Hispanic population, and sitting for an interview with Jose Diaz-Balart of MSNBC.And he ended it with an address to the National Urban League Conference and an interview with Lester Holt of NBC.Privately, Mr. Bush's top strategists, who have become increasingly fixated on halting Mr. Walker, believe that Mr. Trump is nothing short of a godsend. That is because Mr. Trump is drawing support from voters -- blue-collar, less-educated, more conservative -- who are unlikely ever to support Mr. Bush but are essential to Mr. Walker's candidacy.What complicates matters for Mr. Walker, and any of the other Republicans vying for that restive conservative base, is that they will have difficulty matching the bluster or promises of Mr. Trump because he does not operate within the conventional boundaries of political discourse.""Trump is much more willing to be provocative,"" said David Winston, a Republican pollster. ""He'll say something outrageous, and then where do they go? And that's the challenge.""The extent to which the other candidates feel they need to compete with Mr. Trump for that pool of voters may become clear in Thursday's debate. If candidates like Mr. Walker, Mr. Christie, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas directly engage with Mr. Trump, it is an indication of the urgency they feel to cut into his support.But it is unclear what exactly can be done to tarnish Mr. Trump with voters who are drawn to him. His incendiary comments and his personal history have done little to diminish his appeal.""It'll be death by 100 cuts, and he's probably only in his 20s,"" conceded Chris LaCivita, an adviser to Mr. Paul and a veteran operative, adding that Mr. Bush's team is ""laughing their way through the summer.""Even those skeptical about Mr. Trump now say they believe he will remain a factor in the race into this fall, at least through the second debate in mid-September. Many party strategists anticipate he will ultimately self-destruct if exposed as having little familiarity with the pressing issues facing the country.If there is good news about Mr. Trump's rise for those looking for a shot at Mr. Bush, it is that the first votes will not be cast for six months.""If you're another candidate, the good thing is that it's early,"" said Robert Gleason, chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, adding of Mr. Trump: ""He's put the block on everything, just stopped everything dead.""Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.Photograph Jeb Bush Spoke at the National Urban League Conference in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., On Friday, Part of an Effort to Go to ""Places Where Republicans Haven't Been Seen in a Long, Long While.""

"In India, Glimpses of Economic Optimism and Frustration:   [Editorial ]",,"MUMBAI, India -- Arriving at the new international airport here last month, I felt like I had gotten on the wrong connecting flight and ended up in Shanghai. Instead of the smelly and decaying terminal I remembered from the four years I spent here as a news correspondent, the building was sparkling. The walkway to the immigration counter doubled as a museum filled with paintings, sculptures and handmade crafts from around the country.But the old familiar India soon returned when my cousin drove me out of the parking garage and past the slums near the airport that were made famous by Katherine Boo's book, ""Behind the Beautiful Forevers."" Stunning wealth and wrenching poverty have always coexisted here. And it still does -- despite the unbridled optimism of politicians, business executives and middle-class Indians about the kind of economic transformation symbolized by Mumbai's airport. I spent a week listening to such talk. Everybody was sure things would change for the rest of India just as they had for the airport because the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a technocrat with a controversial past, had captured a landslide election victory last year.The rest of the world is also hopeful about India. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are projecting that India will become the world's fastest-growing major economy in the next several years, surpassing China. The Indian government said this week that its economy may already be growing as fast or faster than China's.It is inevitable that India will eventually grow faster than China for the simple mathematical reason that it is easier to make a small economy bigger than it is to increase the size of a larger one. China's economy was more than twice as big as India's in 2013, after adjusting for population and purchasing power, according to the World Bank. Also, China's population is aging and its labor force is shrinking whereas about half of Indians are 25 or younger and its work force will be expanding for many years to come.What is less clear is the kind of an economy India will have. Will it be one that caters to the small elite that can afford air travel, or will there also be money and room for decent, affordable housing with running water and round-the-clock electricity? A recent report found that the country has the largest number of billionaires after the United States and China. Yet roughly half the population is stuck in subsistence farming, hoping for better futures for their children. Those young people receive such a lousy education that many businesses consider them unemployable. Many Indians recognize their country's unique challenges, which will take years to address successfully even as others hope for revolutionary change. I struck up a conversation with a working-class man I met in the northern city of Jaipur, Chhagan, who only identified himself by one name. I asked him if he thought Mr. Modi would make India better, he said: ""Modi is a good man, but he is just one man."" At the Jaipur Literature Festival being held nearby, corporate executives, analysts and government officials offered a more upbeat assessment. One session was titled ""India's Turn: Catalyzing Economic Transformation.""Mr. Modi's government, in office for less than nine months, has already raised expectations significantly among investors and ordinary people by promising to turn the country into a latter-day China with bullet trains, 100 new ""smart"" cities and tens of millions of manufacturing jobs.But there is growing frustration that the change he promised might not come soon enough or that it might be disrupted by some of his fanatical right-wing supporters. Nearly two-thirds of Indians surveyed in a recent poll commissioned by The Times of India said Hindu nationalist groups allied with the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., were hurting ""the development agenda."" Earlier this week, an upstart political party trounced Mr. Modi's B.J.P. in local elections in the territory of Delhi. Last year, his party swept all seven races for the lower house of Parliament in Delhi.Economic euphoria can evaporate quickly. When I lived there in 2010, the Indian economy roared back to life after the financial crisis, and seemingly everyone thought the good times were back for good. The Economist magazine, for example, published on its cover a photo of a racing tiger under the headline ""How India's growth will outpace China's."" But that growth spurt fizzled largely because political leaders at the time became complacent and let corruption and mismanagement spiral out of control.Later this month, Mr. Modi's government is scheduled to present its first full-year budget. Investors and business executives are hoping that it will include proposals for transportation projects, the sale of government-owned companies and changes in taxation. While such measures are important, the budget will have failed if it does not offer a plan to improve public services like education, health and housing.Mr. Modi cannot be expected to cure all of India's problems. For one thing, he is not as powerful as he seems. Like the United States, India is a federal country in which state governments provide most public services. His job is to use all the tools at his disposal to make sure the poorest Indians are not left behind as the economy revs up.Graph Graphic",0.0
"Muslims, Marriage and Bigotry:   Commentary",,"In North Carolina, three young Muslims who were active in charity work were murdered, allegedly by a man who identified as atheist and expressed hostility to Islam and other faiths. Police are exploring whether it was a hate crime, and it spurred a #MuslimLivesMatter campaign on Twitter.And, in Alabama, we see judges refusing to approve marriages of any kind because then they would also have to approve same-sex marriages. In one poll conducted last year, some 59 percent of people in Alabama opposed gay marriage. Somehow a loving God is cited to bar loving couples from committing to each other.These are very different news stories. But I wonder if a common lesson from both may be the importance of resisting bigotry, of combating the intolerance that can infect people of any faith -- or of no faith.I don't think Muslims should feel obliged to apologize for the Charlie Hebdo terror attacks. Nor do I think atheists need apologize for the killing of the three Muslims.But it does seem useful for everyone to reflect on our capacity to ""otherize"" people of a different faith, race, nationality or sexuality -- and to turn that other-ness into a threat. That's what the Islamic State does to us. And sometimes that's what we do, too.O.K. I'm sure some of you are protesting: That's a false equivalency. True, there is a huge difference between burning someone alive and not granting a couple a marriage license. But, then again, it's not much of a slogan to say, ""We're better than ISIS!""There has been a pugnacious defensiveness among conservative Christians to any parallels between Christian overreach and Islamic overreach, as seen in the outraged reaction to President Obama's acknowledgment at the National Prayer Breakfast this month that the West has plenty to regret as well. But Obama was exactly right: How can we ask Islamic leaders to confront extremism in their faith if we don't acknowledge Christian extremism, from the Crusades to Srebrenica?More broadly, one message of the New Testament is the value of focusing on one's own mistakes rather than those of others. ""You hypocrite,"" Jesus says in Matthew 7:5. ""First take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.""We could do with a little more of that spirit these days, at a time when everybody wants to practice ophthalmology on everyone else.When I posted on my Facebook page about the North Carolina murders, one follower, Frank, wrote dismissively: ""Muslims are slaughtering people around the globe (including their own) but let's highlight this story -- seems legit.""I've previously urged Muslims to reflect on intolerance in their camp, and this is an occasion when Christians, atheists and others can do the same. Did the furor in North Carolina that led to the cancellation of the Muslim call to prayer from Duke University's chapel tower inflame sentiments?The Alabama legal drama, with Chief Justice Roy S. Moore of the State Supreme Court defying federal authorities, is, of course, different. But it also is redolent of faith as I-am-holier-than-thou chest-thumping, a reminder of the need for humility.Do Judge Moore and other conservative Christians think that when God made gays and lesbians fall achingly in love with each other, He screwed up?It seems odd to me that so many conservative Christians are obsessed with homosexuality, which Jesus never mentions, yet seem unworried about issues Jesus did emphasize like poverty and suffering. Jesus explicitly advised a wealthy man, ""Go, sell your possessions and give to the poor"" (Matthew 19:21), so maybe that's the Scripture that Judge Moore should follow to demonstrate his piety.Then there's Jesus's praise for those who make themselves eunuchs (Matthew 19:12); but I'd settle for a little ""love thy neighbor as thyself.""I've written often about committed and self-effacing Christians doing outstanding work combating injustice around the world, and it's frustrating that they don't get attention. The problem is that their heroism is often overshadowed by sanctimonious blowhards.Among Americans aged 18 to 24, a 2012 survey found that half or more describe present-day Christianity as ""hypocritical,"" ""judgmental"" and ""anti-gay."" And more regarded it as immoral to view pornography than to have sex with a person of the same gender. Alabama is, once again, on the wrong side of history.Pope Francis has been a breath of fresh air to Catholics and non-Catholics alike because he seems less moralizing and more moral, less about pointing a finger and more about offering a helping hand. After the tragedy in North Carolina and the legal chaos in Alabama, maybe that's a good instinct for all of us.I'm trying something new, an email newsletter.

A Chinese Investment Helps A.I.G. Profit Climb:   [Brief ],,"The insurance company American International Group reported a 5.6 percent increase in quarterly operating profit, driven by investments in one of China's biggest insurers, the People's Insurance Group of China Limited, as well as earnings from the aircraft leasing company AerCap Holdings N.V. A.I.G., the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, also increased its share buyback program by up to $5 billion, and more than doubled its quarterly dividend to 28 cents a share. Operating income after tax increased to $1.9 billion, or $1.39 per diluted share, in the second quarter, from $1.8 billion, or $1.23 per diluted share, a year earlier.The operating income was bumped up by pretax earnings that more than doubled, to $127 million, from AerCap, the world's largest independent aircraft lessor. A.I.G., which is trying to exit AerCap, sold most of its 46 percent stake in early June.The insurer, which began in a two-room office in Shanghai in 1919, also gained $170 million from investments in the People's Insurance Group of China Limited, PICC Property and Casualty Company Limited. However, A.I.G.'s underwriting operations struggled with plummeting commercial property and casualty insurance rates. Pretax operating profit fell 4 percent, to $1.19 billion, in its commercial property and casualty insurance business, typically a strength. The insurer also paid out $88 million more in catastrophe losses. A.I.G.'s stock closed at $64.14 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.",0.0
Designate a Devil's Advocate:   [Question ],,"This interview with Kevin E. Lofton, chief executive of Catholic Health Initiatives, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.Q. Were you in leadership roles when you were younger?A. A lot of what I learned from an early age was around influence. I was involved in a lot of things. I ran track in high school, and I also played piano and competitive chess. I think people generally always looked at me as a leader, and I felt like I was having influence. People wanted to know what I had to say.I didn't have a lot of formal leadership positions, though I was class vice president in my sophomore year of high school, during the same year that Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the class president.Tell me about your parents.My father was an electrician. He worked two jobs when we were young. My mom was a dental assistant during most of my years growing up. She later went back to school and became a dental hygienist.My grandmother in Texas was a big influence on us, too. She was a domestic, but she was a fighter. Needless to say, it was segregated down in Texas at the time, and the street my grandparents lived on when I was little still had ditches. My grandmother led the civic effort to get the streets paved.Another influential person was the dentist my mother worked for. He treated us like we were his children, and a lot of the exposure that I got to things at an early age came through his influence. His wife, for instance, was a bass cellist in the symphony orchestra, and we would go to concerts at Lincoln Center. He actually paid for me to go to the music school that his children were in. We played in Carnegie Hall and New York World's Fair.What was your first management role?My first hospital job was as an emergency department administrator in Jacksonville, Fla. At the time, it was the seventh-busiest emergency department in the country. I was probably 24 and straight out of grad school. I had a staff of about 250 people.That's a big jump. How did you handle it?I realized that a big part of my job was to help people see the ultimate value of the job they do. It was also about looking at what needed to be done and not accepting any excuses. This was a county hospital, the kind of place where sometimes people accept mediocrity. I moved up rapidly because I didn't accept that, and I got things done.At the end of the day, people really want to do the right thing. I saw my job as removing barriers and then celebrating successes. I also brought people into the process. When you bring staff into a meeting and you talk to them about the things we can do to improve, and then you actually act on their ideas and they see that their input made a difference, people will follow you.You also have to be able to relate to people, and not look down on them or talk down to them. I may have a title, but that's not the reason that we need to do this. We're here to do A, B and C. Here's the way you can help with that. What suggestions do you have to make it better? Those are the secrets to success.Were you ever nervous about all that responsibility at such a young age?An early mentor of mine said something to me when I was going to a new job: ""Don't worry. It's just another dog and pony show."" That really stayed with me. When you're taking on another new challenge, you just take a couple of deep breaths and say, ""You can do this. It's just another dog and pony show.""What's unusual about the culture of your current company?In our senior management meetings, we appoint a designated devil's advocate, as we call it. So if we're discussing a critical issue, we'll appoint someone -- and the role rotates -- to be the devil's advocate, no matter what their personal point of view is. That helps you avoid groupthink.How do you hire?I start with the ""why"" -- why are you here, why would this role fit into your career path, and why are you interested in coming to our organization? I then focus on the ""what"" -- what are the things that you've done that relate to what you might do here, and what are your ideas for how you can help us?And then I move to the ""how,"" and that's where character comes in. How do you do business? Somebody might be a cardiovascular surgeon who is going to put a lot of money on our bottom line, but if they yell at nurses in the operating room, then we don't want them.What kind of advice do you give to new college grads?I give a lot of talks to students, and I usually close the sessions with this advice: They should take a blank sheet of paper and an envelope, write down a goal of something that they want to do over the coming year, then seal it. Nobody's ever going to see this except you, I tell them -- it's not for your teachers; it's not for your parents; it's just for yourself.Then a year later, you take it out and grade yourself on whether you worked toward that goal, and then you set a new goal for the next year. It's really just to get them in the habit of looking at the things they need to work on, setting a personal goal and then seeing how they've done against that goal. I still do this myself every year.AuthorAffiliation ADAM BRYANT Each week, Adam Bryant talks with top executives about leadership. Follow him on Twitter: @nytcorneroffice.

Ex-Officer Faces New Charge in Rikers Death:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"A former New York City correction officer implicated in the beating death of a Rikers Island inmate could, if convicted, face up to life in prison after a federal grand jury in Manhattan upgraded the charges against him on Tuesday.The former officer, Brian Coll, was arrested in June for the 2012 death of Ronald Spear, a 52-year-old inmate with kidney problems who walked with a cane. Federal authorities say Mr. Coll, 45, kicked Mr. Spear in the head repeatedly while he was being restrained by two other guards and then falsified official records to make it appear that the use of force had been warranted.Mr. Coll was originally charged with deprivation of rights under color of law and obstruction of justice. On Tuesday, the grand jury added a more serious charge alleging that his actions directly caused Mr. Spear's death.In a statement, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Mr. Spear's death ""was the direct result of Correction Officer Brian Coll's unconstitutional beating."" Mr. Bharara added, ""Repeatedly kicking a downed inmate in the head and then picking up and dropping his head on the ground as he lay helpless, as Correction Officer Coll is alleged to have done, had deadly consequences for Ronald Spear.""Since his arrest, Mr. Coll, who pleaded not guilty to the original charges, has been held at the federal detention center in Brooklyn while he awaits trial. His lawyer, Sam A. Schmidt, said on Tuesday that it was Mr. Spear's serious health problems and aggressive behavior toward officers that ultimately caused his death. ""The jury will be able to see the other side of the story and not simply the allegations by the government,"" Mr. Schmidt said.Another officer, Byron Taylor, 31, who the authorities say held Mr. Spear down while he was beaten, faces several charges, including obstruction of justice for allegedly lying to a federal grand jury. A third officer, Anthony Torres, 59, has already pleaded guilty to filing a false report and conspiracy to obstruct justice in the case. He is scheduled to be sentenced in December.Last year, New York City agreed to pay $2.75 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Mr. Spear's family.",0.0
"At Hiroshima, Japan Again Mourns Dawn of Atomic Age:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"HIROSHIMA, Japan -- Every year on Aug. 6, Hiroshima becomes a city of mourning. And one full of reminders -- some delivered politely, some pointedly -- of the most extreme dangers of modern warfare.Seventy years ago, the city was incinerated by an atomic bomb, its population halved by the new and terrifying American weapon nicknamed Little Boy.On Thursday, political leaders, aging survivors and ordinary citizens gathered at 8:15 a.m. to mourn the moment when the city unwillingly became part of the world's introduction to the nuclear age. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima, together with another that hit Nagasaki three days later, killed more than 200,000 people, most of them civilians.At a ceremony near the onetime industrial exhibition hall that has been preserved as a skeletal monument to the attack, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe renewed a longstanding Japanese pledge to seek worldwide elimination of nuclear weapons. The mayor of Hiroshima, Kazumi Matsui, accused ""selfish"" nuclear powers, including the United States, of standing in the way of that goal.Mr. Abe and other dignitaries placed wreaths in front of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park's eternal flame, where a placard reads: ""Rest in peace. We will not make the same mistake again."" A minute of silence was punctuated by the ringing of a temple gong.The memorial was witnessed by the United States ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy, who was only the second American envoy to attend such a commemoration. Her predecessor, John V. Roos, first did so five years ago, on the 65th anniversary of the bombing, in a shift that was seen as symbolic of the Obama administration's commitment to advancing the cause of nuclear disarmament. But a visit to Hiroshima by President Obama himself, which many in Japan hoped would follow, never came -- much less an apology by the United States for dropping the bombs. The desire for an apology has persisted here even as Japan struggles to come to terms with atrocities committed by its own forces during World War II.Mr. Abe is also pursuing unpopular policies on two issues linked closely in the public's mind with the bombings: national defense and nuclear energy. Small groups of demonstrators gathered at the edge of the ceremony grounds to protest moves by his government to pare back postwar restrictions on the military and to restart nuclear power plants idled after meltdowns at a plant in Fukushima in 2011.Kohei Oiwa, an 83-year-old bombing survivor, sat silently through Mr. Abe's remarks at the ceremony but criticized him bluntly afterward. He condemned legislation now before Parliament that would allow Japanese forces to fight overseas, in limited situations, for the first time since the war. And he criticized as hypocritical the government's repeated pledges to help rid the world of nuclear weapons. Japan, he noted, accepts the protection of the United States, its former enemy turned close ally, including the deterrent provided by the American nuclear arsenal.""Abe's peace is a phony peace,"" Mr. Oiwa said as he waited in line to lay a bouquet of flowers in front of the eternal flame.Such sentiments are widely shared by other survivors. After the ceremony, the leaders of seven groups representing survivors delivered a letter to Mr. Abe demanding that he withdraw the proposed legislation on military deployments. Yet while there are still close to 200,000 officially recognized survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, their average age is over 80, and their numbers are quickly dwindling.The mayor, Mr. Matsui, also took clear if indirect aim at Mr. Abe. In his official ""peace declaration,"" he criticized a desire often expressed by the prime minister and other conservatives to change the pacifist Constitution imposed by the victorious United States. Three generations after the conflict, they argue, Japan should be less constrained by its consequences. Mr. Matsui, however, said, ""It is demanded that the path to true peace indicated by the pacifism of the Japanese Constitution be spread to the world.""Hiroshima, which rebounded vigorously after World War II, is now a thriving city of 1.1 million people, and most of its residents are less overtly political. Kazue Ichikawa, 77, who came to the ceremony with her daughter and granddaughter, said she was in the yard of a Buddhist temple that served as a wartime primary school when the bomb exploded. It was just far enough away that she and her classmates were spared. ""The force knocked me over a gravestone,"" she said.She said that she had not recounted her experiences to anyone outside her family, but that she was considering volunteering at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum ""to inform others of my granddaughter's generation.""Photograph Lanterns Were Released Into a River in Hiroshima On Thursday, As the City Remembered the 1945 Atomic Bomb Attack.

"Activists Block Repair of Sabotaged Lines in Crimea, Leaving Region in Darkness:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"MOSCOW -- Crimean Tatar activists and Ukrainian nationalists on Monday prevented repair crews from restoring the main power lines in southern Ukraine that supply Crimea, leaving the disputed peninsula in the dark and Ukraine and Russia headed toward a standoff over the issue.The power lines were knocked down by saboteurs on Sunday, forcing millions of residents to live without electricity.The Tatar activists who blockaded the damaged site said they would thwart repairs until Russia released political prisoners and allowed international organizations to monitor human rights in Crimea. The activists say that the 300,000-member Tatar minority has faced systematic repression since Russia annexed the peninsula in March 2014.President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine, without mentioning the electricity cutoff directly, appeared to endorse the confrontation.After a meeting with the foreign ministers of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, Mr. Poroshenko echoed the demands of the Tatar protesters, saying that the international community should work to release arrested activists, restore Crimean Tatar broadcasts and reverse the exile of Tatar leaders.""We are not satisfied with today's status quo when the occupational authorities neglect basic rights of Crimea Tatars,"" Mr. Poroshenko said, before making an indirect reference to the destruction of the electricity lines. ""These irresponsible actions caused significant escalation between the activists and occupational authorities.""Mr. Poroshenko also released a letter on Monday that he had first sent to the Ukrainian cabinet on Nov. 4, calling on the prime minister to study the question of halting all freight transport to and from Crimea.The sudden release of the letter almost 20 days after he sent it also seemed to offer a subtle endorsement of the electricity protest.In Moscow, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, reacted calmly, saying that he was unaware of any timetable to repair the lines but that he hoped that Ukraine would take ""rapid measures"" to do the work.President Vladimir V. Putin, who was traveling to a meeting of gas exporters in Iran, did not immediately comment. He was unlikely to take kindly to Ukraine disrupting life for all of Crimea, however, given that he has made its absorption into Russia something of a personal project.Sergei V. Aksyonov, the Kremlin-appointed prime minister of the Crimean Republic, was more exercised, calling the power cutoff ""a terrorist act"" in a statement on Monday.""I would urge Crimeans to be patient and to see what our situation is,"" Mr. Aksyonov said. ""Nobody will be allowed to blackmail us in order to solve any issues.""Ukraine still claims the peninsula, and its senior officials have been perturbed that its seizure by Russia has seemingly dropped off the international agenda, rating a fleeting mention at best whenever the crisis over fighting in southeastern Ukraine is discussed.The issue of supplies coming from Ukraine has been a repeated source of tension, as food, water and electricity still flow from the mainland to the peninsula. A major irrigation canal was shut down in 2014, but significant rainfall and other local sources prevented serious damage to crops this year. In September, Tatar and other activists tried to blockade the main road leading from Crimea to Ukraine, disrupting food supplies.Crimea's only other surface link to the outside world is a ferry line to Russia, with limited capacity. Russia plans to build an enormous bridge, but that would not be completed for at least three years.It was not immediately clear who destroyed the main electric pylons on Friday and Sunday, but the blasted away stump of at least one near the demonstrators was wrapped in the distinctive Crimean Tatar flag, blue with a yellow trident in the upper left-hand corner.Video shown by the ATR network, a Tatar television station now operating in Ukraine after its main channel in Crimea was forced to close, showed Tatar activists tackling the special Ukrainian police units trying to gain access for repair crews.The leadership of both the Crimean Tatars, forced into exile by Russia, and a right-wing nationalist group, Right Sector, endorsed the destruction without claiming responsibility.Mustafa A. Dzhemilev, the leader of the Crimean Tatar minority, told the Ukrainian news website Lega.net that the power pylons ""could have been blown away by the wind.""""Why should we supply the invader with everything he needs?"" asked Mr. Dzhemilev, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament. ""If they have occupied our territory, then we must smoke them out.""Mr. Dzhemilev said those blockading the site would allow repairs to the power lines that supply electricity to the surrounding area in the Ukrainian region of Kherson, but not to Crimea.Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk of Ukraine said he would begin negotiations with Tatar representatives on Monday to try to allow repair crews to begin to work, but there were no immediate results from the discussions.Russian officials said the power supply could be restored in two hours after the trunk lines were repaired. Senior officials at Ukrenergo, which runs Ukraine's power grid, said it would take three to four days to rebuild the pylons.Four local power plants, including two nuclear ones, scaled back production because they had no means to distribute the electricity, Ukrenergo said.More than 1.6 million people still lacked power on Monday morning, Russia's Energy Ministry said in a statement. Local power plants in Crimea, as well as backup generators, were being used to provide power to hospitals, schools and other vital facilities.Russian news media played down the effects of the blockade, noting that balmy weather conditions made heating unnecessary. The Ukrainian news media painted a bleaker picture, emphasizing that cellphones and most gas stations were out of service. Pictures from Crimea showed long lines forming at gas stations and bakeries, and vendors selling candles on street corners.The Crimean authorities declared Monday a day off for nongovernment workers and declared a state of emergency, which can last as long as one month. Crimean officials also said they had enough fuel stocks on hand to keep the backup power plants and generators running for a month.Russia is building an ""energy bridge"" from its mainland territory to Crimea that officials hope will supply most of the peninsula's needs. Its first phase will begin operating by the end of this year, Mr. Aksyonov said.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"Brazilian Implicated in FIFA Case Remains Free, Unlike Many Others:   [Sports Desk ]",,"Some are sitting in jail in Switzerland, while others are under house arrest in places including New York and Asunción, Paraguay. But of the 14 people indicted in May in a far-reaching corruption case within world soccer, only one remains a free man.José Margulies, 75, has not had his daily routine disrupted in São Paulo, Brazil, in a country whose constitution forbids the extradition of its citizens unless they are accused of trafficking drugs or of committing crimes that predate their Brazilian citizenship.""He's living in Brazil as a free man because, according to Brazilian law, it's impossible to charge him,"" said Jair Jaloreto, Mr. Margulies's lawyer. ""He's old and sick, and he mostly prefers to stay home with his wife.""Mr. Margulies has heart disease and diabetes, Mr. Jaloreto said. He was, however, on vacation in Germany when United States officials indicted him in May, according to Mr. Jaloreto; he returned to Brazil soon after and has not left since.As other countries have done with the implicated FIFA officials and business executives who live within their borders, Brazil has begun its own investigation into the United States' allegations against Mr. Margulies. He was indicted on four counts of racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, based on allegations that he, as a broadcasting executive, helped arrange illegal payments between marketing executives and soccer officials.But Brazil's inquiry is expected to take at least a year, Mr. Margulies's lawyer estimated, and in the interim he will remain free.""Without a judicial order, it's impossible to arrest him,"" said Antonio Sergio Pitombo, a lawyer with the Moraes Pitombo firm in São Paulo. But while extradition is unlikely, he said, it is not impossible. Mr. Pitombo suggested that under the Palermo convention, which relates to organized crime and corruption, the Brazilian authorities could agree to send Mr. Margulies to the United States temporarily to testify, requiring that he be returned to Brazil afterward.Mr. Margulies -- who according to prosecutors also goes by José Lazaro, a ""nickname,"" according to his lawyer -- was born in Argentina. He became a Brazilian citizen in 1973, decades before activities that led to the charges began. He also holds Polish and Argentine citizenship.The federal police in Brazil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""It's extremely common for countries all around the world to put in place protections for their own nationals,"" said Rebecca Niblock, an extradition lawyer with Kingsley Napley in London, noting that Russia uniformly refuses to extradite its nationals and that Switzerland, too, offers its citizens strong protections.Though six of the indicted FIFA officials remain in Switzerland, where they were arrested, they are not citizens of that country. Another official, Jeffrey Webb, the former president of a regional soccer confederation, was also arrested there, but he consented to extradition and was arraigned in federal court in Brooklyn last month. Mr. Webb is out on bail in New York, as is Alejandro Burzaco, a marketing executive who turned himself in to the authorities in Italy.Elsewhere, several defendants are fighting extradition but have been arrested by local authorities who are carrying out their own investigations. Among them is Nicolas Léoz, who is under house arrest in Paraguay while that country continues its own inquiry into the charges against him.Ms. Niblock said it was not unexpected that Brazil's investigation of Mr. Margulies might extend into next year while he remained free. ""An investigation like this one would be immensely complicated, and a year would be perfectly reasonable,"" she said.In the interim, Mr. Margulies is immune to arrest only if he remains in Brazil, and international authorities are on alert. In June, Interpol issued so-called red notices for Mr. Margulies and five other defendants, telegraphing that they are wanted by the United States authorities.On Friday, Pietro Calcaterra of Interpol confirmed that the notice for Mr. Margulies was still in effect, meaning if he were to travel outside of Brazil, the United States authorities would be notified upon his arrival in another country.Interpol is also still on watch for Jack Warner, a former FIFA vice president and a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago. Mr. Warner, too, has largely continued about his daily life in that country, where he is active in politics. But, unlike Mr. Margulies, Mr. Warner was arrested and required to surrender his passport before posting bail.Edward Fitzgerald, a lawyer representing Mr. Warner, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York declined to comment.""Mr. Margulies is still wanted by the F.B.I,"" Kelly Langmesser, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York, said Friday. ""He's a wanted fugitive, and we still have a poster out for him.""",0.0
Iowa's Opening Burst Dooms a Cooling Maryland:   [Sports Desk ],,"Iowa could be primed for a big run in the final month of the season, and Maryland could be in danger of a slide at the end of its first year in the Big Ten.Aaron White scored 17 points, Adam Woodbury matched a career high with 16, and host Iowa throttled 17th-ranked Maryland, 71-55, on Sunday.Peter Jok also matched a career high with 15 points for the Hawkeyes (15-8, 6-4), who have won two in a row to finish above .500 in a brutal 10-game start to league play.Iowa opened the game on a 22-3 run and handed the Terrapins their third straight road loss; all of those losses have been by double-digit margins.""We got going offensively, and it snowballed on them a little bit,"" Iowa Coach Fran McCaffery said.The Terrapins (19-5, 7-4) scored just 17 points on 6-of-25 shooting in the first half.

The Terrapins looked just as bad against the Hawkeyes.Maryland had as many turnovers -- eight -- as it did shots in the first 10 minutes. Its defense was even worse, allowing Iowa -- which entered the game ranked 12th in the Big Ten in field-goal percentage -- to hit 10 of its first 15 shots.The Terrapins got a bit of traction behind Trimble and some full-court pressure, but their horrid start was simply too much to overcome. A dunk by White put Iowa up by 34-13 with 2 minutes 3 seconds left before halftime.Dez Wells had 12 points for Maryland, which had 16 turnovers.Mike Gesell had nine assists for the Hawkeyes, whose schedule lightens considerably from this point.

"Paid Notice: Deaths ZAZANIS, GEORGE A.:   [Paid Death Notice ]",,"ZAZANIS--George A.,M.D, pioneer of neurosurgery and former Chief of Neurosurgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, died of cancer on February 4th, 2015, in Vero Beach, Florida. He was 84 years old. Born in Youngstown, Ohio to parents who emigrated from Greece, Dr. Zazanis graduated from the University of Michigan. He earned both M.D. and M.S. degrees from Temple University School of Medicine, and while enlisted as a U.S. Army captain in Newfoundland, Canada, he was awarded a commendation medal in 1959. He completed his residency at Temple University, where he met Marina Pappas Zazanis, his adoring wife of 52 years. Following his residency, he joined the practice of his late partner Henry Liss, and in 1965, they performed the first stereotactic neurosurgical operation in the state of New Jersey. He served as Chief of Neurosurgery at Morristown Memorial Hospital until 1987, when he was appointed to chair the department at UMDNJ. Dr. Zazanis' neurosurgical procedures and clinical research were widely presented and published, and he sponsored numerous postgraduate candidates and postdoctoral fellows. Dr. Zazanis was honored with the title of Archon for his outstanding leadership and service to the Greek Orthodox Church and to the community at large.

Kerry Hails Progress on Trade Pact With Asia:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SINGAPORE -- Days after negotiators failed to wrap up an Asia trade agreement, Secretary of State John Kerry expressed confidence on Tuesday that the pact would be completed, calling it vital for the economic well-being of the region.""We made progress, good progress, in our negotiations toward one of the most significant trade agreements in history, the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" Mr. Kerry said in a speech at Singapore Management University.""No country can expect its economy to grow simply by buying and selling to its own people,"" Mr. Kerry added. ""It is just not going to happen. It defies the law of economics. Trade is a job creator and prosperity builder, period.""The trade pact has been a top priority for the Obama administration, which has proclaimed a policy of focusing more on Asia as part of a ""rebalancing"" of American interests.The White House had hoped that Congress's passage in June of ""fast track"" negotiating powers would pave the way for concluding the accord, which would be the largest regional trade pact in history.But the 12-nation talks have been snagged by differences over access to agricultural markets and protections for drug companies, among other issues. Trade ministers meeting in Hawaii failed to reach a final agreement on Friday, raising concerns that the discussions would be extended into the politically charged presidential election campaign in the United States.Mr. Kerry acknowledged in his speech that the negotiations had been tough and that there were still ""details to be hashed out,"" though he did not discuss any of the obstacles to progress or suggest how they might be overcome.Still, he said there were compelling reasons for negotiations to continue. In addition to generating jobs, he said, the accord would raise the region's standards for labor practices, discourage corruption and better protect the environment.""It will send a message to people within the T.P.P. and outside of support for good governance, transparency, accountability,"" he said, using the initials for the accord.""Every participant will have to comply with core international labor and environmental standards,"" Mr. Kerry said. ""Every participant will have to refrain from using underage workers, unsafe workplaces. Every participant will have to ensure that state-owned companies compete fairly with ones that are privately owned. And every participant will have to fight trade-related bribery and corruption, ensure free and open digital trade, and safeguard intellectual property.""Mr. Kerry said that the Obama administration was still determined to move ahead -- ""boldly,"" he said -- with its policy of focusing more on Asia. But his current round-the-world trip illustrates the challenges in trying to carry out that shift.With the United States increasingly concerned about the Islamic State, the militant group that has laid claim to much of Iraq and Syria and that has found adherents in the Sinai Peninsula and in Libya, Mr. Kerry began his trip in Egypt. As Congress reviewed the nuclear deal that the United States and five other world powers negotiated with Iran, Mr. Kerry then went to Qatar to secure support for the accord from the Arab monarchies in the Persian Gulf before arriving in Singapore on Tuesday morning.Mr. Kerry, who in his speech also endorsed Mr. Obama's clean power initiative and made an appeal to fight climate change, spoke shortly before leaving for regional meetings in Malaysia. He plans to visit Hanoi, Vietnam, on Friday to observe the 20th anniversary of the re-establishment of United States-Vietnamese diplomatic relations.",0.0

Taking an Imagined Journey With John Lennon:   [Review ],,"""Beatlebone,"" the strange and exhilarating new novel by the Irish writer Kevin Barry, is about John Lennon -- kind of. It follows him closely for around 200 pages, through a few comically calamitous days in 1978, as he travels through western Ireland to an island off its coast, bought on a lark 11 years earlier. He's nearing 40 here; past drugs, past scream therapy, far past the Beatles, and stripped raw emotionally, tired ""but not for sleeping,"" full of ""large sad warmish feelings.""A few days alone on his island, he hopes, will bring him the peace that even marriage and fatherhood, though he loves them, haven't. The poignant knowledge that this is an end-of-life crisis, not a middle-of-life one: That belongs to us, not to him.These first 200 pages are nearly perfect, observant, melancholy but not mournful, and tremendously funny, largely because John's endearingly lofty vision of his trip's purpose, a communion with nature and himself, runs immediately into very practical problems. For starters he has trouble simply finding his island; the local fixer taking care of him, a man named Cornelius who is incapable of fixing anything, doesn't have a great idea of how to get there. He tries anyway, leading his famous charge through a series of misadventures, as they dodge journalists, visit the pub in disguise and become stranded in a derelict hotel with a few holdovers from the hippie era.And then another character enters the book: Mr. Barry himself.Suddenly it's 2011, and we're inside his head as he stands ""with all the other hunched pilgrims"" outside the Dakota in New York, the apartment building where John Lennon lived and was killed. Mr. Barry realizes something. ""If I was going to make beatlebone everything it should be,"" he writes, ""I needed to get to the island."" And so he sets off.This gesture is at least as old as Laurence Sterne -- ""baring the device,"" literary critics named it nearly a century ago -- but in this context it feels startling, even risky, because ""Beatlebone"" would have been an excellent novel without it, a tender portrait of a man ""37 years along the road -- the slow-quick, slow-quick road,"" as the novel puts it in a typically lovely, darting line.And yet the risk pays off. The hallmark of Mr. Barry's previous fiction has been his remarkable gift as a stylist; in his only other novel, the much-honored ""City of Bohane,"" a slangy tale about a gang war in the near future, a glance could be a ""lamp,"" a ""check,"" a ""sconce"" -- quick-witted coinages at once low and literary, in that peculiar, flexible Irish fashion. But ""City of Bohane"" was also, in its thinner moments, filmic in the wrong ways, like a Quentin Tarantino reboot of ""West Side Story,"" its violence and lurking sentimentality correlated.""Beatlebone"" is far more profound. Mr. Barry's language is still poetic and reaching and imaginative, but now in effortless service to more substantial themes, in particular love and ""the way that time moves."" As the novel's attention alternates between Mr. Barry's real trip to the island and John's made up one, the identities of the two men -- both artists, both marked by the loss of their mothers -- mingle, until their stories begin to overlap more and more exactly, and finally the two become indivisible, ghosts of each other across the decades. The effect is beautiful, reminiscent at different moments of Virginia Woolf and Geoff Dyer, especially the ambiguous narrator of Mr. Dyer's wonderful novel ""Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi.""Yet it also leaves lingering a significant question, which is how close this book, as it moves further away from John Lennon, actually ever got us to him. Or is that the author's point: that any work about an artist is in some sense a self-investigation, and that to introduce yourself into the narrative is the most honest way to admit that?I happen to love the Beatles, so ardently that I sometimes think that if I could preserve the work of any artists from the last century, shipping it down into the care of our descendants, it would be theirs. Which means, of course, loving John Lennon.""Beatlebone"" faultlessly captures Lennon's acidic, self-loathing, yearning, weary side. (And his sense of humor, too, an essential element: ""Do you have a reservation?"" a hotel clerk asks him. ""I have severe ones,"" he replies, ""but I do need a room."") What Mr. Barry finds more elusive is the other part of John, which remained innocent enough to create the luminous songs he wrote throughout the 1970s.So when John says late in ""Beatlebone,"" ""I think we should all love and ravish each other but I'm holding out no great hopes,"" it's as if Mr. Barry really were the one speaking, with a novelist's appreciation for the complex messed-up-ness of the world. John Lennon always did seem to hold out great hopes.Even as the journeys of the author and his protagonist merge, Mr. Barry and Lennon remain stubbornly distinct. But perhaps what ultimately makes this a great novel is its author's exploration of the ways that sometimes, in art, we do get to become each other -- kind of.BeatleboneBy Kevin Barry299 pages.

Report Sees Weak Security in Cars' Wireless Systems:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Serious gaps in security and customer privacy affect nearly every vehicle that uses wireless technology, according to a report set to be released on Monday by a senator's office.The report concludes that security measures to prevent hackers from gaining control of a vehicle's electronics are ""inconsistent and haphazard,"" and that the majority of automakers do not have systems that can detect breaches or quickly respond to them.""Drivers have come to rely on these new technologies, but unfortunately the automakers haven't done their part to protect us from cyberattacks or privacy invasions,"" said the senator, Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, whose office published the report after obtaining detailed information from 16 automakers.In addition to finding ""a clear lack of appropriate security measures to protect drivers against hackers who may be able to take control of a vehicle"" or hackers who wish to ""collect and use personal driver information,"" the report expressed concerns over how automakers track drivers' behavior and collect, transmit and store that information.The report found that large amounts of data on driving histories are harvested, frequently without consumers being explicitly aware that the information is being collected or how it will be used. At least nine automakers use third-party companies to collect vehicle data, which can make consumers even more vulnerable, and some transmit that data to third-party data centers too.""This reveals that a majority of vehicle manufacturers offer features that not only record but also transmit driving history wirelessly to themselves or to third parties,"" the report said.The information collected includes where drivers have been, like physical location recorded at regular intervals, the last location they were parked, distances and times traveled, and previous destinations entered into navigation systems. A host of diagnostic data on the car is also captured.The findings in the report are based on information received from BMW, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Porsche, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo. Aston Martin, Lamborghini and Tesla did not respond to the requests.Technological innovations for vehicles are expanding rapidly: Safety features powered by radars, lasers and cameras are available in some vehicles and coming to more, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication -- in which cars can share information -- is expected to be available in the near future.At the same time, connecting cars to the Internet means that more vehicles have smartphonelike interfaces that allow for new possibilities, but also carry inherent risks.In November, two auto industry trade groups -- the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Association of Global Automakers -- tried to address consumer concerns by publishing a set of voluntary privacy principles aimed at limiting the use of vehicle data for marketing purposes. The principles called on automakers to collect information ""only as needed for legitimate business purposes.""The report says the phrase ""legitimate business purposes"" is vague enough to allow for all kinds of collection, and asserts that clear federal rules should be established for what are permissible and appropriate uses of drivers' data.Ford and Toyota declined to comment on the report. Fiat Chrysler and General Motors referred questions to the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.Wade Newton, a spokesman for the trade group, said ""automakers believe that strong consumer data privacy protections and strong vehicle security are essential to maintaining the continued trust of our customers"" and cited the November principles as a way that the industry was taking proactive steps.""Auto engineers incorporate security solutions into vehicles from the very first stages of design and production -- and security testing never stops,"" he said.Auto companies post privacy policies in their owner's manuals and on corporate websites, he said, and they ""pledge to provide heightened protections to the most sensitive types of consumer information -- protections that go beyond similar principles in other industry sectors.""",0.0
Rohingya Women Flee Violence Only to Be Sold Into Marriage:   [Foreign Desk ],,"GELUGOR, Malaysia -- The young woman had been penned in a camp in the sweltering jungle of southern Thailand for two months when she was offered a deal.She fled Myanmar this year hoping to reach safety in Malaysia, after anti-Muslim rioters burned her village. But her family could not afford the $1,260 the smugglers demanded to complete the journey.A stranger was willing to pay for her freedom, the smugglers said, if she agreed to marry him.""I was allowed to call my parents, and they said that if I was willing, it would be better for all the family,"" said the woman, Shahidah Yunus, 22. ""I understood what I must do.""She joined the hundreds of young Rohingya women from Myanmar sold into marriage to Rohingya men already in Malaysia as the price of escaping violence and poverty in their homeland.While some Rohingya women agree to such marriages to escape imprisonment or worse at the hands of smugglers, others are tricked or coerced. Some are only teenagers.Their numbers are difficult to gauge, but officials and activists estimate that in recent years hundreds, if not thousands, of Rohingya women every year have been married off this way, and that their numbers have been increasing.The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that a surge of maritime migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar this year brought an increase in ""abductions and marriages arranged without the consent of women whose passage was ultimately paid for by prospective husbands.""""Hundreds, if not thousands, of women and girls have been forced, sold or arranged for marriage via these trafficking corridors since 2012,"" said Matthew Smith, the executive director of Fortify Rights, an advocacy group in Bangkok that monitors Rohingya refugees. ""For some families, it's viewed as an imperative, as a survival mechanism.""""The trafficking gangs are treating this as a rather lucrative business,"" he said, adding that for the women and girls, ""being sold or forced into marriage is the least-worst outcome, and that's a problem.""Ms. Yunus, who now shares a house with her 38-year-old husband and 17 other Rohingyas on Penang Island, Malaysia, said she had little choice after an uncle who had promised to pay for her journey failed to do so.""I chose to marry my husband because the smugglers needed money to release me,"" she said. ""We were afraid of rape. It is better to marry a Rohingya man who can take care of us.""Sharifah Shakirah, a Rohingya refugee in Kuala Lumpur who advises refugees on resettlement, said that many of the women held by smugglers fear that if they do not find husbands quickly, ""the traffickers might sell them to do sex work"" in Thailand or India.While such trafficking is not unheard-of, it appears to be deployed more commonly as a threat than an eventuality.Some women have no say in the matter, according to Mr. Smith of Fortify Rights, which is preparing a report on marriages and human trafficking.""They don't care about anything,"" one 15-year-old girl said of her traffickers, according to notes provided by Mr. Smith. ""If someone pays money, we would have to go to them.""The young women often undertake the journeys under pressure from parents, anxious to send their daughters to safety and to reduce their domestic burdens, and are lured on by smugglers' rosy promises about the cost of the voyage and the good life that awaits them in Malaysia, Rohingyas and experts said.In reality, single women who board smugglers' ships without the means to pay become merchandise, held in a camp or aboard a ship until someone pays for their release.If the smugglers know the woman's family cannot afford the cost, ""they will inform other people and say, 'We have this woman,' "" Ms. Shakirah said.The husbands often turn out to be older and poorer than promised. Some women end up trapped in unhappy or abusive relationships.Two years ago, Ambiya Khatu, 21, married a man in Malaysia who paid $1,050 for her release from smugglers in Thailand. ""Even though he is too old for me, my mother agreed to the marriage,"" she said. ""There was nobody to rescue us, so I agreed.""In Myanmar, formerly Burma, she had hoped to study nursing and work in a hospital. Now she lives in a suburb of Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, caring for her mother, her ill sister and her sister's baby in a cramped room, while awaiting the return of her husband. He disappeared months ago, saying he was looking for work.""After being rescued, my husband asked if I wanted to marry him,"" Ms. Khatu said, her round, expressive face a palette of conflicted emotions. ""He said, 'If you don't want to marry me, you can simply pay back my money which I spent on you.' ""That was impossible.""I don't know the language, so how will I work to pay him?"" she said. ""Also, we don't have any relatives here, and I don't have any legal documentation, so there was no option for me except marriage.""Her mother, Mabiya Khatu, shook her head and murmured in disapproval. Her own husband was killed in 2012, when rioters swept into their village, leaving the family impoverished, she said. The alternative was her daughters being sold into sexual slavery, she said.""If I didn't give my daughter to him, then the traffickers might have sold her into the wrong hands,"" the mother said. ""Traffickers tried to sell both my daughters, so I got them married, and here she is in safe hands, and able to eat at least.""The younger Ms. Khatu frowned. ""I didn't like him,"" she said, ""but I had to like him.""Rohingya men who paid smugglers for brides were reluctant to discuss how the deals were struck. But a phone call recorded by investigators from Fortify Rights last September between a Rohingya woman held in a camp in Thailand and a Rohingya broker reveals the harsh calculus determining a woman's fate.""You have never married yet?"" the broker asks, according to a transcript provided by Fortify Rights.""I have never married,"" she says.The broker says that he knows an eligible man, an elderly Rohingya, willing to pay $780 for the rest of her journey to Malaysia.""Will you marry?"" the broker asks.""Yes, I will marry, if that is the will of God,"" she answers. ""We are in a difficult situation. Would you please try to take us in two or three days? We cannot get food, water, clothes, and cannot take a bath.""After the deal is made, the broker tells a guard in the camp that he needs several more single women for prospective husbands.""You can see them first,"" the guard says. ""If you want to take one or two, that is your decision.""The transactions are not always so clear-cut, however, especially given that Rohingya women come from a culture where arranged marriages are the norm. But in their villages, the women often know the prospective husbands, and they are likely to have more say in the decision.In some cases, impoverished families arrange marriages in advance to pay for a daughter's trip.Some of the women who marry to pay a smuggler's fare describe it as a choice, but Susan Kneebone, a professorial fellow at the University of Melbourne in Australia who is studying forced migration and marriage in Southeast Asia, says that these marriages amount to trafficking when violence, threats or misleading promises are used.""The idea of trafficking is really one of whether there has been an abuse of power,"" she said. ""These women actually don't have that much freedom within their own community, I suspect, and that's all made much worse by the fact that they're traveling to another country.""After anti-Muslim violence erupted in Western Myanmar in 2012, most of the refugees were men. But the number of women and children fleeing from Myanmar has risen in the past two years.One reason is the scarcity of eligible Rohingya men in Myanmar. The shortage has also raised the cost of dowries paid by the brides' families, said Chris Lewa, a Rohingya rights advocate based in Bangkok. Conversely, she said, the high ratio of Rohingya men to women in Malaysia made men there more willing to pay for a bride's journey and to forgo a dowry.This year and last year, she said, ""one can safely say that at least 5,000 young women embarked on boats and would have entered in a marriage after arriving in Malaysia.""For now, the smuggling has been paused by a regional crackdown and the rough weather of the monsoon season. But some Rohingya women are waiting for the trade to resume so they too can flee, even if the price of a ticket is marriage.Tahera Begum, 18, a Rohingya woman who had fled Myanmar a few months earlier, was staying with her sister-in-law in a makeshift camp in Kutupalong, Bangladesh, waiting to continue her journey to marry a man in Malaysia who was chosen by her brother, also in Malaysia.She had not seen a picture of the man, but they had spoken to him on the phone several times.""When I talked to him, he said he had a job, so he had an income,"" she said. ""I would have been happier if I could stay here, but my brother wanted me to get married in Malaysia.""If I get the signal from my brother or husband-to-be,"" she said, ""I will try again.""",0.0

Look Out Below!:   [House & Home/Style Desk ],,"I've occasionally been known to throw myself onto the face of a home-improvement cliff so steep that I can barely make it to the top, let alone finish with something pretty. Last week, I bailed halfway up the cliff, and the crash was gloriously, hideously ugly.But I learned something. I hope.The plan was to spruce up my ceilings with 100 feet of crown molding and roughly 200 square feet of tin panels. I sought advice from, among others, Brian Patrick Flynn, the principal designer of Flynnside Out, a Los Angeles design firm; Don Mandeville, a Home Depot district manager; and Ben Herzog, a Brooklyn-based architect.How hard could it be?Here's how hard: The tin ceiling job was an excruciating disaster. The crown molding job came out O.K., but only after being scaled down to the dimensions of a tiny bathroom.The moral of this story is that, especially with ceiling work, poor planning leads to wasted energy. Wasted energy quickly leads to fatigue. Fatigue leads to stupidity, and stupidity is how you arrive at the bottom of a cliff.The idea of refining your ceiling is a good one, Mr. Flynn said. ""Most homeowners don't realize there's more drywall space above their heads than on the walls, and when you walk into a room your eye goes immediately to the biggest empty space,"" he said.Both Mr. Flynn and Mr. Herzog favor exposed beams and, especially with older restoration projects, tin ceilings. Of the latter, Mr. Herzog said, ""It's a cool material, and it's probably easier to install than putting up a Sheetrock ceiling and painting.""I didn't hear that ""probably."" What I heard was some form of the word ""easy.""The cathedral ceiling on our sun porch is covered with ill-fitting beadboard panels that we installed a few years ago. It seemed a good candidate for tin, since we could simply nail the material to the wood. (When attaching tin to drywall, the installation is more complicated.)Tin tiles cost around $2 to $10 a square foot. We chose tiles toward the low end of that range, painted white. The tiles come in ""field"" patterns and textured border patterns that can slip beneath molding. But our sun porch has chunky molding that we hoped would cover the edges of the field pattern well enough so that we could skip the complexity of a tin border.To install, you simply lay one dimpled border atop the next so that they fit snugly, and then nail the edges into place. My contact at American Tin Ceilings, a manufacturer and online retailer of decorative tin panels, said I should place the first tile at the center and work toward the edges, using metal snips to trim the tiles to fit the outer edges. He even sent a diagram to help.I dutifully measured the beam atop our 12-foot-high cathedral ceiling and nailed the first tile in place with a $30 electric stapler that also shoots so-called brad nails.The first row of five tiles went up easily and looked relatively straight. Soon, though, the tiles stopped aligning perfectly.No big deal. Who would notice the borders separating by a hair? Besides, the longer I obsessed, the more my shoulders and neck complained.Then came the third row. The first tile fit well enough. The second, not so much. The third was O.K. Then came the fourth and fifth tiles, which looked as if they had been installed by someone with a deep hatred of geometry, an extreme fondness for vodka, or both.My shoulders and neck burned as I inspected the mess. On a hunch, I slipped a piece of molding into place to check how it looked over the high ridges of the tiles. Not great.I called my sources.My big mistake, they told me, was not starting at the very center of the ceiling. Instead, I'd laid the first tile on the westernmost edge, which, it turned out, wasn't straight. Naeem Malik, the national sales manager of retail at Armstrong Ceilings, a manufacturer of flooring and ceiling products, said that once the middle tiles are properly set, the rest fall into place.But Mr. Flynn recommended sketching a grid on the ceiling to account for every tile before starting and said that novices should expect to spend three or four weekends covering a 10-by-12-foot ceiling.If we loved the look, I might have forged ahead. But we didn't, so we returned the unused tiles for a refund and called it a day.Beer never tasted so good.>Next came the crown molding, which was easier on the body but harder on the brain.Design-wise, crown molding is usually associated with grand spaces and big budgets. And intricately carved molding can indeed command prices in the range of $20 a foot. But prices for simpler patterns and cheaper materials start at around $1 a foot, and my sources said that these moldings would work fine in less formal spaces.Mr. Flynn, for instance, said that molding that is four inches wide, or slightly less, works well with eight-foot ceilings. ""But installing it can be tricky because no room is completely straight,"" he said. ""So if you're in an older house and you know things aren't straight, it's better to leave it to your carpenter.""To which I'll add: If you're in a newer house with walls that are absolutely straight, it may still be better to leave it to your carpenter.The challenge is getting the molding to lie flat on every surface, while crafting the corners so the separate pieces perfectly abut. That requires measuring every angle, calculating the corresponding angles of the molding and cutting the material with nearly surgical precision.Mr. Mandeville, of Home Depot, said that a compound miter saw is essential equipment for the job, since it simultaneously cuts two angles. Cheaper units sell for $80, but I spent $200 on one with a laser-cutting guide, among other helpful features, and it was well worth it.Another good investment is the book ""Crown Molding and Trim: Install It Like a Pro!"" by Wayne Drake, of CompoundMiter.com, which sells the book and installation materials. I ordered a set of templates, which are physical reminders of how to place the molding in the saw before cutting it, and gauges for determining the exact angle of any given corner.The book was slightly confusing at times, but it included a huge bonus: Mr. Drake's contact information. He offers free installation advice to customers, and at least once during my installation a tip from him saved me from burying my head in a snow bank.Mr. Mandeville recommended using a partner to help install the molding, so I called my favorite victim, Bob Sr., who knows his way around a miter saw but who was equally puzzled by compound miter angles.We surveyed the living room. We looked at the miter charts. I remembered my recent debacle in the sun porch.""Want to try the bathroom first?"" I asked.""Definitely,"" he said.Even with the angle-measuring tools, the templates and Mr. Drake's live counsel, we ruined several pieces before finishing. Smartly, I had painted the pieces before cutting, but I'd foolishly bought molding made out of cheap particle board, and when I tapped one piece against a wall it broke.Four hours and many head-scratching moments later, we completed the installation. I added some spackling paste to the holes and touched up with some paint. Everything was tight and neat-looking without being too fussy.And now that I know how to measure and cut the molding, I may even try it on the whole first floor.Photograph Caulk Molding Before Installing to Close Gaps (Workforce Caulk Gun, $6.50; Dap Latex Caulk, $1.50 for 10.1-Ounce Tube).; Basic Tools Will Cover Much of a Crown Molding Job (Plumb 16-Ounce Hammer, $10).; a Power Saw Can Help with More Precise Cuts (Ridgid 10-Inch Dualbevel Miter Saw with Laser Guide, $199).; the Right Charts Eliminate Guesswork and Reduce Waste (Compoundmiter .Com Miter Table and Compound Miter Chart: $3 Each).; Left, American Tin Ceilings Pattern 13 in Speckled Oak, $17 for 24-Inch-Square Tile; Right, American Tin Ceilings Pattern 19 in Copper Brushed Bronze, $42 for 24-Inch-Square Tile.; Crown Molding Often Requires Longer Nails (Grip-Rite 10d, 3-Inch Finish Nails, $3.50 for 1-Pound Box).

Trade Deal Negotiation in Pacific Stumbles:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. LAHAINA, Hawaii -- Trade negotiators from the United States and 11 other Pacific nations failed to reach final agreement on Friday, with difficult talks on the largest regional trade agreement ever deadlocking over protections for drug companies and access to agriculture markets on both sides of the Pacific.Trade ministers, in a joint statement, said late Friday they had made ""significant progress"" and will return to their home countries to obtain high-level signoffs for a small number of final sticking points on the agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with bilateral talks reconvening soon.""There are an enormous number of issues that one works through at these talks, narrowing differences, finding landing zones,"" said Michael B. Froman, the United States trade representative. ""I am very impressed with the work that has been done. I am gratified by the progress that has been made.""Still, the breakdown is a setback for the Obama administration, which had promoted the talks here as the final round ahead of an accord that would bind 40 percent of the world's economy under a new set of rules for commerce.President Obama's trade push had been buoyed by Congress's narrow passage in June of so-called fast track trade negotiating powers, and American negotiators had hoped other countries could come together once Congress had given up the right to amend any final agreement.In the end, a deal filled with 21st-century policies on Internet access, advanced pharmaceuticals and trade in clean energy foundered on issues that have bedeviled international trade for decades: access to dairy markets in Canada, sugar markets in the United States and rice markets in Japan.""No, we will not be pushed out of this agreement,"" said a defiant New Zealand trade minister, Tim Groser, who held out for better access for his country, the largest exporter of dairy in the world.Australia, Chile and New Zealand also continue to resist the push by the United States to protect the intellectual property of major pharmaceutical companies for as long as 12 years, shielding them from generic competition as they recoup the cost of developing next-generation biologic medicines.""There's always been more than one issue,"" said Representative Sander Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who is here as an observer.The trade ministers who gathered at the luxury hotels of Maui this week for talks that went deep into the night did have some successes. They reached agreement on broad environmental protections for some of the most sensitive, diverse and threatened ecosystems on Earth, closing one of the most contentious chapters of the Pacific accord.They also reached agreement on how to label exports with distinct ""geographic indications,"" such as whether sparkling wine can be called champagne. And they agreed on a code of conduct and rules against conflicts of interest for arbitrators who would serve on extrajudicial tribunals to hear complaints from companies about whether their investments were unfairly damaged by government actions.But the failure to complete the deal -- eight years in the making -- means the next round of negotiations will push the United States ratification fight into 2016, a presidential election year. Most Republican candidates are very likely to back it, but a final agreement would force the Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton to declare her position, which she has avoided.This week, she told reporters, ""I did not work on T.P.P."" as secretary of state, although she gave a 2012 speech in Australia declaring the accord ""the gold standard in trade agreements.""The push for the Pacific deal has already split most Democrats from their president. Further delay raises the prospect that a deal sealed by President Obama might have to be ratified by his successor, just as George H. W. Bush's North American Free Trade Agreement was secured by Bill Clinton.The failure of the Maui talks pointed to the extreme difficulty of reaching agreement with so many countries, each with its own political dynamics. Vietnam, Malaysia and New Zealand were willing to make significant concessions to gain access to United States markets.But with Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, fighting for his political life ahead of national elections in October, Canada would not budge on opening its poultry and dairy markets.Chile, with a new, left-of-center government and existing free trade agreements with each of the countries in the Pacific deal, including the United States, saw no reason to compromise, especially on its demand for a short window of protection for United States pharmaceutical giants.Australia's delegation insisted that pharmaceutical market protections beyond five years would never get through Parliament, and the United States team was demanding 12.Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico's secretary of economy, was defiant on the hard line he took against the export of Japanese cars with any less than 65 percent of their parts from T.P.P. countries. ""I am fighting for the interests of my country,"" he said.The bright spot might have been the environmental negotiations. The completed environmental chapter would cover illegal wildlife trafficking, forestry management, overfishing and marine protection, and it could prove to be a landmark, setting a new floor for all future multilateral accords.""As centers of biodiversity, T.P.P. countries cover environmentally sensitive regions from tundra to island ecosystems, and from the world's largest coral reefs to its largest rain forest,"" reads a summary of the environment chapter, obtained by The New York Times. ""T.P.P.'s Environment chapter addresses these challenges in detail.""Under the agreement, the 12 countries -- from Peru and its rain forest to Vietnam and the diverse Mekong Delta -- must commit to obeying existing wildlife trafficking treaties and their own environmental laws. Environmentally destructive subsidies, such as cheap fuel to power illegal fishing vessels and governmental assistance for boat making in overfished waters, are banned.The chapter singles out the ""long-term conservation of species at risk,"" such as sea turtles, sea birds and marine mammals and ""iconic marine species such as whales and sharks.""Failure to comply would subject a signatory to the same government-to-government compliance procedures as any other issue covered by the trade agreement, potentially culminating in trade sanctions. United States negotiators hope that just the threat of economic sanctions will bolster relatively weak environmental ministries in countries like Peru, Malaysia and Vietnam.Some environmental groups, and many Democrats in Congress, are very likely to be dissatisfied. They complain that agreeing to a series of ""obligations"" falls short of ""requirements."" The Sierra Club has complained that the United States has not pursued trade remedies against countries obliged to environmental enforcement under existing accords, such as the United States-Peru free trade deal.But most major environmental groups remained circumspect, or cautiously optimistic, until they could read the details.""Negotiators have accomplished much, but the hard work is far from over,"" said David McCauley, senior vice president for policy at the World Wildlife Fund. ""Individual nations now must live up to their T.P.P. conservation obligations, including putting in place effective measures to ensure that they are responsible traders in wildlife and products provided by our forests and oceans.""The impact of the Pacific accord's environmental chapter could be broad, both for the nations in the deal and those outside. The 12 participating countries account for more than a quarter of the global seafood trade and about a quarter of the world's timber and pulp production. Five of the countries rank among the world's most biologically diverse countries.Some, like Vietnam and Malaysia, have long been on the watch list for illegal wildlife trafficking, such as the illicit trade in rhino horns. Japan has long been scrutinized for its treatment of whales and dolphins. The World Bank has estimated that as much as 80 percent of Peru's logging exports are harvested illegally.Under the terms of the new accord, member countries would be required to strengthen port inspections and document checks, a provision that could expand the scope of the deal beyond the 12 countries. Illegal wildlife and timber harvests bound for countries like China go through ports of the 12 countries. And countries in the deal are required to take action if they discover contraband that has been harvested illegally, even if the product is not illegal in their country.Negotiators say they substantially narrowed the number of outstanding issues. They vowed to keep the momentum going. But, as one non-United States official said, if talks go into hiatus for long, it could be easier for many of the countries to say no than yes.",0.0
Concern Mixes With Trust Issues for a Troubled Jet:   [Sports Desk ],,"FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- The first eight minutes of Coach Todd Bowles's news conference on Friday were devoted to a subject he had thought he would not have to address again. Willie Colon answered questions about it, as did Brandon Marshall and Damon Harrison.For the third consecutive day, the Jets were forced to discuss the questionable decision-making of one of their best players, defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson. His latest embarrassing episode -- not the four-game suspension levied last month for violating the N.F.L.'s substance-abuse policy -- involved being charged with resisting arrest and numerous traffic violations after the police in Missouri said they had clocked him driving at 143 miles per hour, an incident that could extend his absence from the playing field beyond Week 5.When Richardson reported to work on Friday, he encountered an atmosphere tinged with compassion but also suspicion. As concerned as the Jets are about Richardson's health and welfare, they also cannot count on him as much as before the latest incident. Richardson had to apologize to his teammates and coaches, again, and later he was brought in front of the news media to explain his transgressions, again. The Jets' trust in him has eroded, and he knows it.""I let them down,"" Richardson said. ""Simple as that.""The Jets are still trying to determine what Richardson was thinking on July 14 -- 12 days after his suspension was announced -- when, according to the police, he raced his Bentley at outrageous speeds with a loaded handgun beneath the driver's seat floor mat, a 12-year-old in the back seat and what officers called a ""very strong odor"" of marijuana wafting through the car.Richardson has not been charged with any violations related to the gun or the marijuana or with child endangerment. Tim Lohmar, the prosecuting attorney for St. Charles County in Missouri, said in a telephone interview Friday that he could say ""with a reasonable degree of certainty"" that Richardson would not be charged any further.When Richardson met with Bowles, he explained what had transpired that night, and Bowles said Richardson sounded remorseful. But Richardson did not disclose why he had concealed his arrest from the team.""You lose a lot of trust,"" Bowles said. ""Like I said, actions speak louder than words. As a man, you have to own up to what you've done.""Richardson, a popular figure in the locker room, did not confide in any of his teammates. Nor did he tell his parents, he said, who found out about his arrest through news reports.""It's hard to say a guy's a good guy when two things like this happen,"" Bowles said. ""But he's a good guy. But good guys don't always do the right things.""Bowles added: ""Right now I'm just worried about getting him the help; he needs the help. I'm not even worried about the football player. Like I said, we can win without him. It would probably be more fun with him, but we're prepared to win without him. The biggest thing is working on him getting better as a person.""Several times on Friday, Bowles alluded to Richardson's having a ""problem"" and said that the Jets would try to help him. Asked what that problem was, Bowles said he was not certain but that he was troubled and disappointed by the quick succession of the incidents.""The way I handle my business, I just always handle it on my own,"" Richardson said. ""Just wasn't smart.""Calling it a pending legal matter, Richardson did not share many details with the news media about what happened on July 14. After alluding Thursday to feeling depressed, he acknowledged that he had been rattled by a death in the family. Richardson called it ""just one bad night.""""I thought it would be fun to show my family members something,"" he said. ""They never rode in a car like that before.""Richardson is permitted to practice during training camp and to play in preseason games, but he cannot be on the active roster until Oct. 5, the day after they play Miami in London.The N.F.L. will investigate whether he violated its personal conduct policy, which is separate from the substance abuse program, and it is possible that Richardson could be facing an additional suspension.Richardson, who could be facing a year in prison for his Class A misdemeanor, is to be arraigned on Aug. 31, and he said he hoped the league would wait until he had gone through the justice system before reaching its decision. If Richardson were to plead not guilty, Lohmar said, a trial would be set in six to eight months.""We just want the best for Sheldon,"" Colon said. ""It's not about how we feel at the end of the day. It's his career, it's his lifestyle that's kind of out there. We want him to just be a better person off the field.""That is Bowles's primary concern, as well, but he is also trying to build a team and return the Jets to the playoffs after a four-year absence. He wants Richardson to be part of it.""That's up to him,"" Bowles said. ""That'll all depend on the next couple weeks, days and months go by and whether he gets the message and how it turns his life around. We're here for him. We're trying to help him out.""EXTRA POINTSThe Jets' rookie receiver Devin Smith is expected to miss most of training camp after breaking ribs on Friday, the team said. He was being held in the hospital overnight as a precaution. The Jets did not say how Smith had sustained the injury, but he was slow to get up after an acrobatic catch during practice and was escorted inside for examination.Photograph The Jets' Sheldon Richardson, Who has Been Charged with Resisting Arrest, with Reporters On Friday.

Spinoff Strategy Bears Fruit for IAC:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"Pop quiz. Which company has created more value for shareholders over the last two decades: Disney, Microsoft or IAC/InterActiveCorp?If you guessed Disney or Microsoft, as most people do, you'd be wrong.The correct answer is IAC, Barry Diller's hodgepodge of Internet businesses that has long lived in the shadow of tech behemoths like Amazon and Facebook.Mr. Diller, the colorful media mogul turned early Internet evangelist, has somewhat accidentally built a unique business model: Buy digital businesses, fold them into a conglomerate and then spin out the most successful ones, like the Match Group, the online dating company that had its initial public offering last Thursday after being carved out of IAC. Match now has a market value of about $3.7 billion.In 2008, Mr. Diller began a grand experiment of breaking up IAC, which is based in New York. There's Expedia, TripAdvisor (a spinoff of Expedia), Ticketmaster, LendingTree, Interval Leisure Group, HSN and now Match. At the time, IAC was considered by some to be suffering under what skeptics called the ""Diller Discount."" A 2006 Barron's article, ""Barry Diller's Dilemma,"" argued that IAC's assets were vastly undervalued as a conglomerate, but even when he began to split the company up, the stocks of the spinoffs initially underperformed.But today, the numbers tell a different story.If you invested $1,000 in IAC in August 1995 when Mr. Diller began the business -- at the cusp of the dot-com boom (and subsequent bust) -- you'd have about $16,000 today, assuming you reinvested dividends and held on to shares of the various companies spun off from IAC. By comparison, if you invested $1,000 in a fund that tracked the Nasdaq index, you'd have about $4,800 today. In other words, you would have done more than three times better with Mr. Diller.""I had no idea in my head,"" Mr. Diller said in an interview, when asked whether he set out to create this unusual business model from the outset. ""Everything that I've ever done is one foot in front of the other.""But he said he did recognize that IAC could act as a sort of ""central flywheel"" to create, buy and finance companies to later be spun out. It occurred to him, he said, when he was talking to the chief executive of Ticketmaster, which was then a wholly owned company of IAC in the mid-2000s.""I first realized it"" when the unit's chief executive ""came into my office and said that he wanted to spend money on technology and that he wanted approval,"" Mr. Diller said, because the investment would reduce operating profits by half. ""I said, 'So you mean I'm like your daddy and you're coming to ask me permission to do this thing?""'It was at that moment, Mr. Diller said, that he decided the business would be better off as a stand-alone entity in the public market. ""If you were on your own,"" he told the chief executive, ""do you really think you'd go out in one year and take your operating income in half with nothing else to say about it?"" Mr. Diller added: ""That night I thought, 'You know what? The shining light should not be shielded. The guy's actions should be subject to real-world conditions rather than the false condition of being inside this so-to-speak capital-allocated company.""And so began what has turned IAC into a minifactory of spinoffs. ""I'm really an anti-conglomerateur,"" Mr. Diller said.He is not the only media chief executive whose anti-conglomerateur tactics have paid off. Three other companies that have aggressively spun off assets -- Dish Network, Time Warner and Liberty Media -- performed even better in the stock market than IAC.And it is a business strategy, Wall Street analysts say, that might be deployed by that other Internet giant, Google, which recently reorganized its corporate structure. Earlier this year, Google changed its name to Alphabet and reorganized the company to give its many divisions more independence from its dominant search and advertising business. Alphabet's founders have said they intend to keep all of the divisions as part of the company, but it's only logical that Alphabet could one day spin off Google Life Sciences or its Nest Labs home products unit.Unlike the Google guys, Mr. Diller did not start IAC in a garage. In 1995, after a successful Hollywood career, Mr. Diller struck out on his own, acquiring a 20 percent controlling interest in Silver King Communications for $10 million. Silver King was a small media company, but it broadcast the Home Shopping Network, which became his vehicle to make acquisitions, eventually renaming the entire company as HSN. In 2004, it became IAC/InterActiveCorp, which, at least in architecture circles, is best known for its Frank Gehry-designed headquarters along the West Side Highway in Chelsea.Invariably, skeptics say that all of these restructurings and spinoffs are nothing more than financial prestidigitation. So I put the question to Mr. Diller: Isn't this not so much a business model as it is a bunch of paper shuffling? Shouldn't all these businesses have the same value, together or apart?""It's the opposite of paper shuffling,"" Mr. Diller snapped back, somewhat outraged by the question. ""It is the total distribution of shares in a multibusiness company into a successive number of independent companies, some of which may be controlled or not, but that's not the issue."" These companies, he said, ""are under the scrutiny of a set of shareholders only wanting to own that business. I think that's very healthy.""In Mr. Diller's view, spinning out a business imposes a discipline and focus that it might lack inside a conglomerate. In some cases, it's hard to argue with Mr. Diller's point. In 2012, Expedia, which had already been spun off from IAC, spun off its popular travel guide site, TripAdvisor. Today, TripAdvisor is worth more than $12 billion on its own. (Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Expedia, is a director of The New York Times Company.)""Nothing fundamental changed,"" Mr. Diller said, except that TripAdvisor was public and had to swim on its own. ""The result of it was of course that TripAdvisor was a much better company.""Still, despite all the carving out and spinning off, IAC remains a monolith of some 150 digital brands including Ask.com, About.com, Vimeo, Collegehumor.com, Dictionary.com and The Princeton Review. Just two weeks ago, IAC made a hostile bid for Angie's List, a repository of online reviews for home repairs and other services. In its letter to Angie's List's board, IAC said it would consider combining Angie's List with its HomeAdvisor business. Hmm. Sounds as if Mr. Diller is shopping for his next spinoff.Photograph Barry Diller at a Tribeca Film Festival Party This Year. In 2008, He Began Breaking Up His Company, Iac/Interactivecorp.

Fair Wages for Uber Drivers:   [Letter ],,"To the Editor:Re ""Uber Case Highlights Outdated Worker Protection Laws"" (DealBook, Sept. 16):Our workplace laws need updating, but not for the reasons the article states. Having a say over hours, or the option to quit if conditions are bad, does not convert workers into entrepreneurs who can forgo basic protections like minimum wage.Moved by Uber's and Lyft's lofty promises, one Seattle driver, Takele Gobena, borrowed money to buy a car that met company requirements and began driving 55 hours weekly. His earnings, after expenses, amounted to $2.65 an hour. Sure, he could quit, but he owed $8,500 on the car that drove his bosses' profits.We should update our workplace laws -- to ensure that workers like Mr. Gobena can work for a fair wage and a better life, no matter what their classification or their bosses' claims about what they want. We'd all benefit if these innovative companies stopped battling every attempt to improve working conditions and instead honed a business model that doesn't rely on a cheap, unprotected work force.SARAH LEBERSTEIN>New YorkThe writer is a senior staff attorney with the National Employment Law Project and co-author of its report ""Rights on Demand: Ensuring Workplace Standards and Worker Security in the On-Demand Economy.""Company / organization: Name: Uber Technologies Inc; NAICS: 511210, 518210",0.0
The Case for Aid to Central America:   [Editorial ],,"There are two important policy debates in Washington that deal with the vexing problem of illegal immigration. One is being approached intelligently; the other is decidedly not.The first debate involves the Obama administration's request for $1 billion in next year's budget for development programs in Central America, a funding level that would roughly triple the assistance Washington currently contributes to the region.If the administration succeeds in significantly ramping up aid to Central America, it stands a much better chance of meaningfully tackling the root causes of instability that over the decades have led thousands of people to embark on dangerous journeys to the United States searching for a better life.The second debate is about the budget of the Department of Homeland Security. Republicans offered to allocate funding for the department, which includes the agencies that handle immigration benefits and enforce immigration laws, on the condition that the Obama administration's program to shield certain immigrants from deportation be scrapped. Democratic lawmakers have pushed back.If a funding bill is not passed by the end of this month, when the department's current budget expires, the Republicans will have accomplished little more than placating the conservative base of the party by blocking a presidential initiative they wrongly characterize as amnesty. The Obama administration has rightly threatened to veto any funding bill that would undo the reprieve the administration has extended to some long-term immigrants.The debate over unauthorized immigration is polarizing and complex, and under the best of circumstances, the issue will take many years to address meaningfully. But Republicans who would shortchange the Homeland Security Department should pause in their reflexive assault and consider the merits of the White House's long-term approach. They also should recognize that they would deservedly be blamed if Homeland Security agencies are ill-equipped to respond to natural disasters or other calamities in the months ahead because of lack of funding.Many leaders in Latin America have come to view the United States over the past decade as a largely disengaged neighbor whose foreign policy attention span has been consumed by crises outside the hemisphere. Although the underlying causes of the wave of unaccompanied minors that rushed to the United States in 2014 were years in the making, the influx took Washington largely by surprise.As American officials began exploring ways to stem the flow, they found a surprising, if uneven, level of cooperation from the leaders of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, the three countries where a vast majority of the children came from. Government officials there were persuaded to accept a higher number of repatriated kids and helped dispel the notion that anyone who managed to sneak into the United States would be allowed to stay.Then, when the number of people apprehended at the border became more manageable, the Obama administration began contemplating the type of political and economic reforms that could, over time, make the prospect of migrating to the United States less appealing. It concluded that greater cooperation among countries in a region rived by rivalries and uneasy relations among leaders was key. In addition, the poorer countries in Central America must invest in their education systems and make their economies more attractive to foreign investors.It will take far more than $1 billion in American aid to accomplish those goals. But an infusion of aid would give the United States more leverage in pressing Central American leaders to take initial steps, some of which would come at a political cost domestically. It also would most likely lead to stronger cooperation on other critical transnational problems like drug trafficking, criminal networks and climate change. Having greater influence in the region, which continues to reel from the repercussions of American military interventions in the 1980s, would be sensible at a time when Russia and China are making significant economic inroads in Latin America.In selling the initiative to members of Congress, Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. has argued that the costs of dealing with continuing large waves of migrants, if security and poverty worsen in the region, will almost certainly exceed the kind of investment the White House has proposed. No one who has carefully studied the history of Central America would disagree with that.",0.0
"Passion Play Endures, and Italians Become More Than Merely Players:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SORDEVOLO, Italy -- The horses were skittish. The microphones occasionally went silent or screeched shrilly. Phones in the audience trilled a little too often.But by and large, the amateur performance of ""The Passion of Christ"" here on a cool June evening went off without a hitch, the townspeople taking to their roles with considerable verve.Three times a week until late September, rain or shine, the residents of this small Piedmont town will re-enact t he Passion, the final days of Jesus' life, just as their parents did before them, and their parents, and their parents.More than half of the town's 1,300 residents are involved in the production in one guise or another. About 400 tread the boards -- sand, actually -- of a stage that hundreds of others have worked on for months, recreating a small-scale Jerusalem at the foot of the Alps. This year, the youngest actor is 3, the oldest 72.""It's an obsession in Sordevolo,"" said Celestino Fogliano, the current director of the Passion, which is performed here every five years, consuming the town for the play's run and many months before. ""It's in our DNA.""This year is the play's 200th anniversary in the town.Like most of Sordevolo's residents, Mr. Fogliano, an engineer, boasts a prestigious Passion pedigree, having started as a 5-year-old angel in the 1960 performance, then graduating to speaking parts.""I am a former Christ,"" he said, adding that the lead role was ""a family thing."" His great-grandfather played Jesus in 1870, and his son played Jesus in a children's version.Yes, there is a children's version of Christ's agony, the town's spring training camp for a tradition that remains very much alive despite Europe's shift toward greater secularism, which is palpable through declining church attendance in Italy.Passion plays continue throughout Europe, though the fortunes of this form of popular piety have ebbed since it was introduced in medieval times. Just last month, 90 Passion groups from 15 European countries met in Sordevolo for the 31st annual Europassion conference.Most Passion plays are linked to the week leading up to Easter, but in Sordevolo, the ritual gradually migrated to later in the spring, and then summer for an extended run.The text used for Sordevolo's Passion was written in the 15th century, and scholars still do not agree on how it arrived here. Though the story it recounts is familiar to many, the language is ornate and difficult to follow, even for some native Italian speakers.""We act with our hearts more than technique, but the value is in its popular nature,"" said Guido Galassi, a workplace-security expert by day and the actor portraying the Good Thief by night. Most Sordevolo residents know the text by heart, he added.A procession along the town's main street precedes each performance, and residents line the sidewalks to cheer on their neighbors. Devotion to Sordevolo's Passion remains strong even among people who move away.This is the second time that Marco Caldi, a surfing and scuba-diving instructor who plays Jesus, has returned to his hometown from Bali, Indonesia, where he has lived for the past six years, to take part in the Passion despite an almost paralyzing stage fright.""I've been attacked by 10-meter sharks, and I've been tossed around in storms, but that's nothing compared to the fear I feel in front of the public,"" Mr. Caldi said. ""The only time I really relax is when I die on the cross.""Over the years, Sordevolo has heightened its showmanship with grander sets, more elaborate choreography involving charging horses, and the construction in 2004 of a 2,400-seat amphitheater to keep spectators out of the rain.It is the town's way of measuring up to the production re-enacted every 10 years since 1634 in Oberammergau, Germany, which is by all accounts the brightest star of the genre. That Passion can run as long as eight hours with a three-hour break for a meal. Sordevolo's productions barely top two or three hours, with no intermission.""Oberammergau is a whole other ballgame,"" said Carlo Pedrazzo, the president of the Popular Theater Association of Sordevolo, which finances and coordinates the Passion and is the heir of the committees of residents that have been running the show since 1850. ""It's big business; we know that goal is far away.""Other locals point out, not always kindly, that Oberammergau's residents are paid to take part and that profits are divided at the end of the run. In Sordevolo, the only paid actors are the 14 horses used by the Romans to periodically charge across the stage, and the profits are used for charity.That said, Sordevolo admires how Oberammergau has been able to market its Passion, which drew about 500,000 visitors to its most recent staging, in 2010. Sordevolo's brought in 40,000.That same year, the Popular Theater Association of Sordevolo entered into a partnership with an American tour operator to increase foreign visitors, and so far, nearly 40 American groups have booked tickets for this year's shows.""It's not about the money,"" Mr. Galassi said. ""It's about making the Passion known outside Italy.""Money from tourists, local officials say, could also help offset the crisis that Sordevolo and surrounding towns have been facing since the textile industry that propped up the local economy took a downturn a few years ago.""The textile industry is dying, so we invested in culture,"" said Sordevolo's mayor, Riccardo Lunardon. ""We said let the Passion grow, and with it the town will grow.""Over the years, the city transformed a number of abandoned homes into bed-and-breakfasts, and a museum was created to house artifacts of past Passions.In off years, the Passion amphitheater is used for concerts. It has also become the site of an annual international motorcycle rally, which this year was titled ""Blood, Sweat, Beer, and Rock 'n' Roll.""Though the local church has always given its benediction to Sordevolo's Passion, the play is very much a civic affair. ""The parish has always been marginal; this was set up as a lay institution,"" Mr. Pedrazzo said. ""People aren't chosen to participate because they go to church.""In fact, casting is the only ""delicate moment"" of the entire process, when the town's acclaimed harmony is put to the test.""Gossip is part of the history of the Passion,"" Mr. Pedrazzo said diplomatically.Photograph The Cast After an Amateur Performance of ""the Passion of Christ"" in Sordevolo, Italy, in June.

Spartans Stun Buckeyes With a Late Field Goal:   [Sports Desk ],,"COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Michael Thomas and Jalin Marshall, Ohio State's best wide receivers, both had inexplicable drops on what should have been simple throw-and-catches against Michigan State on Saturday. The drops came on two of the staggering six three-and-out drives the No. 2 Buckeyes had.It is difficult to say whether catching the ball would have even mattered. Wherever an Ohio State player was, a Michigan State defender was there to stop him. The result was grinding, sleet-soaked trench warfare in which the No. 9 Spartans, even without their starting quarterback, Connor Cook, played their best game of the year and upset the Buckeyes, 17-14. The victory came on a 41-yard field goal by Michael Geiger, a junior, as time expired -- along with, in all likelihood, the Buckeyes' aspirations of repeating as national champions.Michigan State (10-1, 6-1 Big Ten) now controls its destiny, so that a win next Saturday at home against Penn State would send it to face Iowa on Dec. 5 in Indianapolis for the conference championship game. A win there would make the Spartans likely, if not guaranteed, contenders in the College Football Playoff.Ohio State (10-1, 6-1) faces a more dire postseason picture. To have a shot at the Hawkeyes and the Playoff, not only does it need to win at Michigan next Saturday -- something the Spartans barely managed -- but Michigan State would need to lose.Buckeyes Coach Urban Meyer said he had trouble thinking about the prospect of repeating as national champion: ""Oh, boy, we've got to get a couple of first downs and start finding a way to complete a pass and beat our rival,"" he said, referring to Michigan.The Buckeyes, undefeated and playing at home, were the clear favorites Saturday. As it became increasingly likely that Cook, who injured his shoulder in last week's 24-7 win over Maryland, might not play, oddsmakers set the line at two touchdowns.Michigan State -- used to feeling overlooked in favor of Michigan -- exploited the chip everyone else seemed to place on its shoulder.""We sat around all day and listened to how we were underdogs,"" Coach Mark Dantonio said.Michigan State center Jack Allen added, in reference to two Ohio State defensive linemen: ""I read somewhere someone said we couldn't stop Joey Bosa or Adolphus Washington. I didn't see them back there too much today.""Michigan State quarterbacks Damion Terry, a redshirt sophomore, and Tyler O'Connor, a junior, entered Saturday's game with a combined 63 pass attempts in their college careers.Yet they traded duties admirably on Saturday. O'Connor was 7 of 12 for 89 yards, Terry 1 of 4 for 2 yards. Though Michigan State used some misdirection and some designed runs, particularly for the more mobile Terry -- who rushed for 25 yards -- it more often ran a modest version of the pro-style offense that Dantonio has favored.The rain, which started minutes before kickoff and turned harder as the temperature fell, made passing less of an option anyway.""We like that nasty weather,"" said Shilique Calhoun, a Michigan State defensive end.The Spartans' first touchdown, in the second quarter, came after O'Connor hit wide receiver Aaron Burbridge for 36 yards and running back Gerald Holmes ran twice, for 9 and 7 yards, setting up a 12-yard touchdown pass from O'Connor to fullback Trevon Pendleton.Ohio State committed four penalties for 20 yards, not including a declined pass-interference call on the 36-yard Burbridge completion. Its defense did not play like the highly ranked unit it is, giving up 294 total yards and forcing just one turnover from two inexperienced quarterbacks.That turnover came when Bosa sacked Terry and Sam Hubbard forced a fumble. The Buckeyes recovered at the Michigan State 32-yard line, and it led to Ezekiel Elliott's 1-yard touchdown run on fourth-and-goal with 12 minutes 45 seconds left in the second quarter.But Bosa, who is projected to go high in next year's N.F.L. draft, also committed three offside penalties, including one on a Michigan State fourth-and-8 in the fourth quarter on a 75-yard drive that culminated with a two-yard touchdown run by Gerald Holmes to tie the game at 14-14 with 12:03 remaining.It was telling that the only turnovers -- Terry's fumble and a muffed punt reception late in the third quarter by Michigan State's Macgarrett Kings Jr. -- led to the only two drives Ohio State started in Spartans territory and, in turn, Ohio State's only two scores.Ohio State entered the day averaging more than 36 points per game, but Michigan State's defense held the Buckeyes to 132 total yards. Quarterback J. T. Barrett went 9 of 12 for 46 yards.Meyer blamed himself, saying he was ""not content"" with the play calling. Elliott, a junior running back and a strong contender for the Heisman Trophy who ran for 33 yards on 12 carries, questioned the play calling after the game.Both Elliott and Cardale Jones -- who started at quarterback during Ohio State's championship run last year and for the majority of this season -- indicated after the game that they would leave after this season, presumably for the N.F.L.Ohio Stadium set a record with an announced crowd of 108,975. O'Connor said he had played here once before, in a high school all-star game. A native of Lima, Ohio, he seemed to speak for several Spartans from Ohio with grudges to bear, including Cook, Pendleton and Geiger.Ohio State, O'Connor said, had contacted him just once during the recruitment process -- as a punter.Photograph Michael Geiger (4) After Kicking the Winning Field Goal for Michigan State As Time Expired.

G.O.P. Candidates and Mass Shootings:   [Editorial ],,"Despite the repeated horror of mass shootings in churches, movie theaters and schoolrooms, the Republican candidates running for president are remarkably quiet about how they would deal with this most pressing public health challenge.""We define gun control real simple -- that's hitting what you aim at,"" Senator Ted Cruz of Texas told a political gathering in New Hampshire earlier this year, typifying the level of pandering by the Republican field to the gun lobby.In contrast, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, is taking up the gun control issue once more, 15 years after the defeat of Al Gore left her party leaders swearing off the subject as a losing cause. ""We have to take on the gun lobby,"" Mrs. Clinton told a New Hampshire crowd last month. ""This is a controversial issue. I am well aware of that. But I think it is the height of irresponsibility not to talk about it.""Tell that to the Republican candidates staunchly opposed to gun safety laws, like limits on ammunition used in the rapid-fire, battlefield-type weapons favored by mass shooters and a ban on unregistered weapon sales by dealers at gun shows. Mass shootings involving three or more murder victims have been on the rise in recent years, according to federal data, while gun production has more than doubled since 2008.Republican candidates prefer to focus on the mental health of mass shooters as the decisive issue, not easy gun access, as if both issues should not be forcefully pursued by sensible public leaders.After the recent shooting deaths at a Louisiana movie theater by a man who obtained his gun out of state, Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican presidential candidate, proudly pointed to his state's recently joining the federal watch list that attempts to track mentally troubled people who should be denied guns. But his state had ignored the list for years and remains one of the lowest in spending on mental health care. After the shootings, Mr. Jindal proposed that gun owners be allowed to bring their weapons to movie theaters.While short on sensible gun safety prescriptions, the Republican candidates are quite precise in disclosing the types of pistols and rifles they proudly own. According to The Washington Post, Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio prefer .357 magnum revolvers; Donald Trump has a Heckler & Koch .45; Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina owns an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, and so forth, for a total of at least 40 guns among 15 candidates.The survey found two non-gun owners: Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has been busy on the hustings scrambling back from his state's strong gun safety laws (""There would be a whole list of things I would change,"" he said), and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, who signed the reckless Stand Your Ground law that has been used to reduce gun owners' culpability in shootings.Mr. Bush, rated A-plus by the National Rifle Association, said in his 2003 declaration to N.R.A. conventioneers: ""The sound of our guns is the sound of freedom!""",0.0

For the singer Anita Darian, getting to Carnegie Hall not only took practice; it also took a kazoo.Her versatile voice carried her there in 1960, where she sang and played kazoo with the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein's baton. But Ms. Darian reached far more listeners with her keening, uncredited background singing on the Tokens' 1961 hit ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight.""She died on Feb. 1 at 87 in Oceanside, N.Y. Lynda Wells, a longtime friend and an executor of her estate, said the cause was complications after intestinal surgery.Ms. Darian was a session singer and stage performer when she was asked by the producers Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore and the songwriter George David Weiss to provide backing vocals for ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight,"" which Mr. Weiss had adapted from a South African song.Ms. Darian's high-pitched vocal -- at one point soaring over the lines ""In the jungle,/ the mighty jungle/ The lion sleeps tonight"" -- provided a memorable counterpoint to the lead vocal and the harmonized lower-register refrain ""A-wimoweh-a-wimoweh."" The record spent three weeks atop the Billboard pop chart.Ms. Darian also sang behind Mickey & Sylvia on their 1957 hit ""Love Is Strange"" and recorded with Burt Bacharach, Dinah Washington, Patti Page and others, usually without credit and often emulating the eerie sound of a theremin.Her talents were more frequently acknowledged onstage.

U.S. and French Responses to Refugees:   [Letter ],,"To the Editor:Re ""Bill to Restrict Syrians in U.S. Passes in House"" (front page, Nov. 20):The same Congress that has not acted on President Obama's request to authorize military action against ISIS was all too eager to act against its victims -- Syrians fleeing death or enslavement.Make no mistake about it, the hysteria surrounding Syrian refugees, reflected in this legislation, is a victory for ISIS.One of the primary goals of terrorism is to scare individuals and governments into inaction or overreaction, thereby validating the power and legitimacy of the terrorists.

The recent terrorist attacks in Paris were a horrific tragedy, but they should not be used as the basis for rapidly expanding mass surveillance programs without due consideration and public debate, where possible, about the proper balance between national security concerns and privacy and civil liberties.As the 9/11 Commission aptly noted in recommending the creation of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, the choice between security and liberty is a false one; if our liberties are curtailed, we lose the values that we struggle to defend.Our relatively new, independent, bipartisan agency can be a critical part of the solution to the problem you have identified, and as chairman I am cognizant that our mission has never been more critical.The extension of existing surveillance programs or creation of new ones can be important in preventing future attacks, but such programs must safeguard the constitutional rights that Americans hold so dear.The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board is uniquely situated to examine these programs and will continue pursuing its mission of providing in-depth, informed analysis to the president, Congress and the public.DAVID MEDINEWashington",0.0
"Stocks, Especially of Banks, Sink in Greece as Athens Market Reopens:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"ATHENS -- Investors issued a vote of no confidence in Greece's economy on Monday, dumping stocks as trading on the Athens exchange resumed for the first time in five weeks.A plunge of more than 16 percent for the main Greek index and a 30 percent sell-off for bank stocks were the latest signs of Greece's shattered economy. But the resumption of trading was a necessary step as Greece tries to emerge from controls on financial activity that the government, confronted with a bank run, imposed at the end of June.Analysts said stock prices could begin to recover in the weeks to come, bringing much-needed capital into the country, as investors with an appetite for risk look for bargains.In yet another sign of trouble, though, new survey data on Monday showed a fall in Greek manufacturing activity since the government imposed controls in late June on the flow of money out of Greece.Much depends on the outcome of negotiations between government officials and representatives of the country's international creditors on a multibillion-euro bailout, Greece's third in five years. The talks entered a second week on Monday.""If the new deal with creditors is struck and ratified, Greek stocks could rebound nicely,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said in an email. ""And if the deal then actually holds, with Greece implementing the structural reforms demanded by creditors, Greece could recover strongly.""He added: ""That is a big if.""After initial talks with foreign envoys on Friday that focused on Greece's finances, privatization of public assets and bank recapitalization, Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said that ""there was convergence on some points, less on others.""The stock exchange had been closed since the end of June, when the government also shut banks in an effort to prevent more money from leaving the country after talks with creditors collapsed. Banks reopened on July 20, but restrictions on money transfers and withdrawals remain in force.The resumption of trading in Athens was intended to be another step toward normalcy, but instead, investors used the opportunity to flee exposure to the Greek economy.Shares on the exchange initially dropped nearly 23 percent as trading began on Monday, with bank stocks leading the rout. While the main index recovered somewhat by the end of trading, bank shares did not. They might have fallen even more on Monday, but selling was halted after the declines reached 30 percent, in accordance with Athens stock exchange rules.Banking has been among the hardest-hit sectors of the Greek economy, and lenders are dependent on emergency cash from the European Central Bank to stay afloat.Greek shares recovered slightly by closing and were down 16 percent, but the initial price declines showed that most investors were not yet willing to bet on the country again.Bank stocks ""will fall quite a bit more and will take a while to rebound,"" said Nikos Pantelakis, chief executive of Pantelakis Securities, an Athens brokerage firm.Mr. Pantelakis said that shares of companies outside the financial industry, like the telecom company OTE, Aegean Airlines or the betting firm OPAP ""will recover faster.""",0.0
Bill Blocking Plan to Reduce Mute Swans Is Vetoed:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. It was always destined to bring public relations misery: a state agency's campaign, approved by experts but undeniably unpleasant, to exterminate the lithe-necked, snow-white mute swans of New York State, in the name of ecological health.To judge by the commotion that greeted the announcement nearly two years ago, and that has bedeviled the State Department of Environmental Conservation ever since, the agency might just as well have marked out butterflies or kittens for mass murder.But in the dispute between those who see mute swans as an invasive species and those who question the science behind that label, the nadir did not arrive until Monday, when a state senator suggested the mute swans were the innocent victims of a hazy political conspiracy.""There's something else going on here, in my opinion,"" the senator, Tony Avella, a Democrat from Queens, said in an interview, two days after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo vetoed a bill Mr. Avella sponsored that would have halted the state's culling plan for two years and required the environmental agency to provide scientific proof that the mute swans were, in fact, harmful.""This has nothing to do with the mute swans. Somebody who has real political influence doesn't like them, in my opinion, because there's no real evidence here that they're an invasive species or why they have to come up and kill them all,"" Mr. Avella added. ""Someone, some political entity that has political connections, is exerting some huge influence to get the agency to kill them.""It was the second time in two years that Mr. Cuomo had vetoed the bill, each time explaining that it duplicated efforts by the environmental agency to revise its swan-management plan in the wake of the public outcry.The plan, which originally called for eradicating virtually all 2,200 of the state's mute swans by shooting, gassing and other measures, was changed this year to emphasize non-deadly control methods. The revised proposal, however declawed, failed to appease animal-rights activists and the bill's sponsors, who continued to insist that the agency had presented no convincing evidence that the swans were harmful.""Impartial observers find it impossible to really assess what the D.E.C. is accusing the mute swans of, because they haven't provided any specific data, just these very broad, speculative accusations that may or may not be true,"" said David Karopkin, the founder of GooseWatch NYC, an animal-rights group. ""I'm not really sure it should be called science, because it doesn't seem scientific to me,"" said Mr. Karopkin, who added that he was not a scientist.After the revised plan was announced, the Department of Environmental Conservation received about 8,000 comments, the vast majority of which were form letters expressing opposition, said Jomo Miller, a spokesman for the agency. It hopes to issue a final version of the plan by the end of this year, he said.Mute swans were first imported to New York from Europe in the 1800s, in order to adorn the estates of wealthy landowners outside New York City. They are now more numerous and, according to wildlife experts, more destructive than their early admirers could have imagined: They pollute waters with their feces, destroy the habitats of native ducks and geese and, according to the environmental agency, pose a threat to airplanes.""In extreme cases, mute swans may attack and kill ducklings, goslings or other small water birds,"" the agency's revised proposal notes, citing two scientific studies and ""many video clips on the Internet.""The new plan aims to limit the swans in Long Island, New York City and the lower Hudson Valley to fewer than 800 birds. Upstate, where swans have settled mainly around Lake Ontario, about 200 birds would be eliminated.The agency promised to use nonlethal methods such as egg-addling, a process in which swan eggs are coated with oil to prevent them from hatching, ""where practical and timely.""Dr. Paul Curtis, a wildlife management expert at Cornell University, said that while mute swans in New York had not yet reached the numbers they had in other states, where swan populations have grown exponentially, the environmental agency was correct in trying to get ahead of the problem.The proposal points out that there are two species of swans that are native to New York, the tundra swan and the trumpeter swan.""Both of these native swan species provide some opportunities for public enjoyment of swans in New York,"" the revised plan noted, looking, perhaps, for silver linings.Unfortunately, the public seems to enjoy the mute swan most of all.""Leave the swans alone. That should be the policy. Enough already,"" said Assemblyman Steven Cymbrowitz, a Democrat from a swan-packed waterfront area of Brooklyn who sponsored the bill in the Assembly, in a statement after Mr. Cuomo's veto.He and Mr. Avella both vowed to reintroduce the bill during the upcoming legislative session, which begins in January, for what would be its third journey through the Legislature.Follow The New York Times's Metro coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the New York Today newsletter.",0.0
Deadly Siege Ends After An Assault on A Mali Hotel:   [Foreign Desk ] [1 ],,"DAKAR, Senegal -- Heavily armed gunmen shouting ""Allahu akbar"" stormed a Radisson Blu Hotel early Friday in Bamako, the capital of the West African nation of Mali, seizing scores of hostages and leaving bodies strewed across the building.The gunmen barreled past the hotel's light security, using fake diplomatic license plates to confuse guards, and then burst into the lobby with their guns blazing.""They started firing everywhere,"" said a receptionist at the hotel who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. ""They were shouting, 'Allahu akbar,' "" meaning God is great. ""They cut someone's throat, a white man.""""I hid in my office,"" he said. ""I saw four of them, armed to the teeth.""By late afternoon, the siege appeared to be over, and no more hostages were being held, said Col. Salif Traoré, Mali's minister of interior security.United Nations officials said that at least 19 people had been killed, as well as two or three attackers, with bodies found lying in the basement and on the hotel floors. They noted that security forces were still sweeping the building in search of bodies and evidence that would shed more light on the assault.An American development worker, Anita Ashok Datar of Takoma Park, Md., was killed, as was at least one Belgian citizen. The nationalities of the other victims were not immediately clear.The gunmen took ""about 100 hostages,"" said Gen. Didier Dacko of the Malian Army, before soldiers sealed the perimeter and stormed inside, ""looking for the terrorists.""From early on, dozens of guests, including women, children and older people, streamed out of the hotel after hiding in their rooms, many of them crying and barely clothed.The attack unfolded with 125 guests and 13 employees inside, according to the operators of the hotel. The visitors had come from far and wide, including Europe, India, China, Turkey and Algeria. They included diplomats, businesspeople, pilots and flight attendants.President Obama condemned the assault from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, calling it ""another awful reminder that the scourge of terrorism threatens many of our nations.""The siege in Mali, a former French colony, occurred only a week after terrorists with assault rifles and suicide vests killed 130 people in attacks across Paris.It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack in Mali. Al Jazeera reported that it had received a recording asserting that a local militant group, Al Mourabitoun, had carried out the assault in conjunction with Al Qaeda's regional affiliate, though the claim could not be independently confirmed.France's defense minister told French television that Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a longtime Qaeda member who claimed responsibility for the 2013 siege of an Algerian gas plant in which dozens of hostages were killed, was ""likely behind"" the attack in Mali, but he acknowledged that ""we are not completely certain of it.""Mr. Belmokhtar has long been a shadowy figure among extremists. Since June, he has been reported killed at least twice, but American officials concede that he is probably still at large.Mali has long struggled with insurrection and Islamist extremism, including smaller-scale attacks on a restaurant and another hotel this year.""We don't want to scare our people, but we have already said that Mali will have to get used to situations like this,"" President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita of Mali, who was visiting Chad, told France 24. He added, ""No one, nowhere, is safe, given the danger of terrorism.""Northern Mali fell under the control of rebels and Islamist militants in 2012. A French-led offensive ousted them in 2013, but remnants of the militant groups have staged a number of attacks on United Nations peacekeepers and Malian forces. Hundreds of French soldiers remain in the country.A peace accord was signed in June between the government and several rebel factions. But the truce has been broken several times, growing lawlessness has driven civilians from the north of the country, and the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali is proving to be one of the deadliest in the world. So far 40 peacekeepers have been killed.United Nations officials said they were worried that the attacks could have been intended, at least in part, to undermine the halting steps toward peace. Some of the people at the hotel were diplomats in town for a meeting to monitor those efforts. In a statement Friday, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's office said he ""deplores any attempt to derail"" the peace process.The Radisson Blu Hotel is a popular place for foreigners to stay in Bamako, a city with about two million people.Twelve to 15 Americans were believed to be at the hotel when the gunmen arrived, an American Defense Department official said. About 20 Indian citizens were there but were evacuated safely, the Indian ambassador to Mali said.Germany's Foreign Ministry said that two Germans were among the hostages who had been released.Six Belgians were registered in the hotel, according to a Foreign Ministry spokesman in that country. At least one of them, a 39-year-old Belgian working for the Wallonia-Brussels regional Parliament, died during the attack. He was in Mali for a conference aimed at training Malian civil servants. Another Belgian remained missing, the ministry said.A diplomat at the Chinese Embassy in Bamako said eight Chinese businesspeople had been trapped in the hotel. Embassy officials at the scene were in touch with some of the Chinese hostages by WeChat, a Chinese messaging service, the diplomat said.Kassim Traoré, a Malian journalist who was in a building about 160 feet from the Radisson, said the attackers had told hostages to recite a declaration of Muslim faith as a way of separating Muslims from non-Muslims. Those who could recite the declaration, the Shahada, were allowed to leave the hotel. The Shabab, a Qaeda affiliate in East Africa, used a similar approach in the attack at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2013.Clément René, 57, a French citizen, came out onto the balcony of his fifth-floor room after he heard repeated gunshots around 7 a.m. One of the attackers, bearing an AK-47, was running into the hotel, shooting back at the hotel security forces.As shooting intensified, Mr. René fled back into his room, turned off the lights, put his phone on silent mode and waited. ""The sound kept coming up as if it was moving from floor to floor,"" he said. ""The sound of guns, explosions and what seemed to be a grenade.""He felt as if he was in the middle of the crossfire. ""I then sent hundreds of text messages, to my family, my wife and two daughters,"" Mr. René said.He was finally freed from his room by Malian soldiers who stormed the corridor of his floor. In the lobby, he passed a body with a tarp thrown over it.""All I could see were his shoes sticking out,"" Mr. René said. ""Big black ranger boots, which made me think it might be one of the terrorists."" The glass lobby doors had been shattered.Kamissoko Lassine, the hotel's chief pastry chef, said two armed men arrived at the hotel around 7 a.m. ""They were driving a vehicle with diplomatic plates,"" he said. ""You know how easy that is at the hotel? The guards just lifted the barrier.""""They opened fire and wounded the guard at the front,"" Mr. Lassine said. ""They took the hotel hostage and moved people into a big hall.""A member of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Mali said there were many French people in the hotel, including Air France staff members. The airline later said in a statement that 12 of its crew members had been at the hotel and were freed.Five Turkish Airlines crew members, including pilots and flight attendants, were also freed, while two remained inside the hotel, a Turkish government official said.Mali has been crippled by instability since January 2012, when rebels and Qaeda-linked militants -- armed with the remnants of the arsenal of the Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi -- began advancing through the country's vast desert in the north and capturing towns.A coup, stirred in part by anger over the government's handling of the insurrection, ousted Mali's elected government in March 2012. Amid the chaos, Islamist rebels consolidated their hold on the northern part of the country, imposing a harsh version of Islamic law.In January 2013, the Islamist forces began advancing south from their northern stronghold, heading in the direction of Mali's capital. France sent in troops to stop them. A brief military campaign halted the Islamist advance, recaptured cities and towns like Timbuktu that had been under the militants' control, and chased the remaining Islamist fighters into the desert.But then, with no warning, other militants linked to Al Qaeda stormed a vast gas production facility in the desert of neighboring Algeria, taking dozens of expatriate workers hostage. Thirty-eight were killed during the siege of the gas plant.With hundreds of French troops still in Mali and the country highly reliant on donors, elections in 2013 restored a democratic government. But its hold on the north remains weak.There are frequent attacks by Islamist fighters, in particular on United Nations troops, in the northern provinces. In August United Nations workers were killed in an assault on a hotel in central Mali. Five months before, militants killed five at a restaurant in Bamako.In the assault in August, jihadists stormed a hotel in Sévaré, north of the capital, where United Nations staff members were staying, seizing hostages and killing at least five Malian soldiers and a United Nations contractor.",0.0

"Political Clout in Mexico, Homes in the U.S.:   [News; Series ]",,"In the fall of 2013, one of Mexico's top housing officials posted an item on Twitter about an advertising campaign promoting mortgages for low-income Mexicans. The campaign's message was simple: ""The most important thing in life is in your house.""It carried the tag line, ""Homes with value.""The official, Alejandro Murat Hinojosa, knows something about homes with value, especially across the border.Over the years, he and members of his immediate family -- starting with his father, José Murat Casab, a former governor of Oaxaca -- have bought at least six properties in the United States, including two condominiums near a ski resort in Utah, another at the beach in South Texas and at least one in Manhattan, according to records and interviews. In New York, José Murat's children have also lived for periods of time in one of the more modest condos at the luxurious Time Warner Center overlooking Central Park.Ownership of the homes was often obscured through variations on family names listed on deeds or through shell companies, according to records examined by The New York Times. In fact, on the day the younger Mr. Murat tweeted about the housing program, public filings in Florida recorded the transfer of a $750,000 Boca Raton condo that had been purchased in his wife's name to an entity called IMRO 2013 Trust.The Murats' real estate holdings stand in contrast to the Everyman image that José Murat, renowned for his political might and booming personality, worked to project as governor.""I arrived to the state government with my wife, Lupita, and my four children,"" he said a year before his term ended in 2004. ""And I'm leaving as I arrived, with the same trousers, with the same shoes, with the same shirts and the same car.""The Murat properties, which emerged during a Times investigation into the people behind shell companies that own condominiums at the Time Warner Center, have not been the subject of any official inquiry and there is no evidence of any wrongdoing behind the purchases. But the private assets of Mexico's public officials have come under intense focus recently with a fresh round of revelations and protests centered on the country's endemic corruption. (Read a summary of this article in Spanish.)Last fall, a scandal erupted over reports that a government contractor had built a multimillion-dollar home for the wife of Mexico's president, Enrique Peña Nieto. While Mr. Peña Nieto's wife, Angélica Rivera, said she was paying for it with money she earned as a soap opera star, she also revealed she owned a condo in Florida. Around the same time, Mr. Peña Nieto disclosed his own $3.3 million in real estate, jewelry, art and other investments. Last week, he said a new federal comptroller would examine purchases by him and his wife of homes in Mexico.And in December, an official at Infonavit, the housing agency run by Alejandro Murat, resigned after a photo of his son with a Porsche was posted on social media, setting off a furor and prompting federal inquiries. The official said the posting was a joke and the car did not belong to his family.These revelations added to the already widespread anger over accusations that corrupt police officers were involved in the abduction and presumed murder last year of 43 college students by a drug cartel. As demonstrations spread, Mr. Peña Nieto was reeling. His Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, had ruled the country for seven decades until 2000, and he had pledged to erase its legacy of corruption when he took office more than two years ago.José Murat, the former Oaxaca governor, has long been a PRI insider. His rise from a childhood in one of Mexico's poorest states to a position as a power broker who has the president's ear is the stuff of lore. There was a failed, and to some skeptics faked, attempt on his life; a long campaign to block a federal audit of state spending; and a record of hardball political tactics. Mr. Murat, who has also served as a federal legislator, recently raised his profile again by leading an effort by the Peña Nieto administration to build a cross-party legislative agenda.Mr. Murat's 39-year-old son, Alejandro, by contrast understated and polished, worked for Mr. Peña Nieto in state government before being appointed to the federal housing post. In some ways, the father and son represent the new and the old of the PRI, said Edward L. Gibson, a Northwestern University professor who studied Oaxaca for a book on authoritarian governments.""Peña Nieto may be the new face of the PRI,"" Mr. Gibson said, ""but the dinosaurs are still part of the coalition.""José and Alejandro Murat denied ownership of several residences around the country that The Times traced to them.José Murat said the Time Warner condo was owned by a relative. Alejandro Murat said the Florida condo was owned by his mother-in-law. Another Manhattan condo, which records show was originally purchased in the name of Alejandro's wife, belongs to an uncle, he said.In an email, José Murat said the only United States properties owned by his immediate family were the two condos in Park City, Utah. They were purchased in 2004 -- one by his two sons and the other by his two daughters -- for a total of $690,000. At least one of the Murat children was a teenager at the time. But Mr. Murat said: ""I do not personally own any real estate directly or indirectly in the United States.""The Murat properties show how the legal mechanisms available in the United States to hold property without disclosing the actual owner's name can make tracing money difficult. This can be a particular problem for Mexico, which, like many developing nations, has long experienced the flight of both legitimate and illicit capital.Wealthy Mexicans are buying property in the United States at a brisk pace with few questions asked, The Times found, even as border security is tightened against poor immigrants trying to cross into the country.""You have all these governors coming and going here, and they have investment properties in the United States with money made in Mexico,"" said Juan Ruiz-Healy, a Mexican journalist who anchored the country's ""60 Minutes"" program and has written about José Murat over the years. ""The U.S. will never say to them, 'Where did the money come from?""'The GovernorThe assassination attempt is like so much of Mr. Murat's 40-year political career, full of drama and suspicions ultimately left unresolved.There are numerous versions of the event, but the initial one went like this: One morning in March 2004, Mr. Murat was outside the Hotel Victoria in Oaxaca when armed men ambushed the 1999 Nissan Quest minivan he was in, leaving six bullet holes.""The matter here is that they tried to assassinate,"" Mr. Murat said in a televised interview days later. ""I have mixed feelings -- anger, rage -- because what they wanted at the end of all this was a dead body.""Even though the governor was slightly injured, there were skeptics who believed he had staged the attack to somehow enhance his image. The federal attorney general issued a news release questioning details of the attack. During the federal investigation, Mr. Murat repeatedly delayed giving a statement and the attorney general asked a judge to order the arrests of seven people who had backed up the governor's account on charges of perjury or altering the crime scene.The whole matter faded away after Mr. Murat demanded that the federal Congress put the attorney general on trial instead.The episode came toward the end of Mr. Murat's term, but by then there was much intrigue around him, built up over decades in politics.Mr. Murat grew up in Ciudad Ixtepec, in poor, mountainous Oaxaca State, where his parents were shopkeepers. He was in law school in Mexico City around the time of the Tlatelolco massacre in 1968, when military and police officers turned their guns on student protesters. While students raged against the PRI, Mr. Murat joined a pro-government group and met other young party loyalists, including Fidel Herrera Beltrán, the future governor of Veracruz, who remains a close friend. Mr. Murat went on to hold numerous PRI jobs, including posts as a party spokesman and as party representative to several states.""He was just a middle-level functionary,"" said Federico Estévez, a political science professor at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México. ""But he had the right connections.""Files from a former Mexican intelligence agency, which kept tabs on many foes and friends of the government, suggest that early on, Mr. Murat caused some amount of controversy.The files, available at the national archives, contain what amount to unverified field reports. One reported on a 1982 visit by the PRI presidential candidate to Oaxaca, which Mr. Murat then represented as a federal legislator. Residents circulated a letter signed by three local politicians, saying Mr. Murat had been putting his friends and relatives in public offices in an effort to ""take over everything"" and impose a ""dictatorship on the people.""Beyond connections, Mr. Murat has a certain bravado and an imposing physical presence. ""It was Lyndon Johnson style,"" Mr. Gibson, the Northwestern University professor, said. ""Stand up, tower over them and just threaten them with his size.""In 1998, Mr. Murat, then about 50, was elected to a six-year term as governor of Oaxaca. Mexico's governors wield considerable power, mostly owing to the large amounts of federal money at their discretion, especially in poorer states like Oaxaca.But there have been few checks on how the public money is spent, and Mr. Murat had a reputation for tightly controlling the distribution of federal funds to local officials as a way to maintain power.Manuela Garza, who worked in the state's planning office, said, ""The distribution of policies and all of that wasn't equal."" As part of her job, Ms. Garza visited villages where people lived without power, water or adequate health care, and she said the perception was that Mr. Murat ""wasn't prioritizing the people, that he was steering money to his regions.""Soon after Mr. Murat became governor, a new federal commission moved to audit Oaxaca's use of federal funds. The Mexican Congress also proposed looking into money that the state had started steering to a handful of companies, according to congressional records.For years, Mr. Murat and some other governors argued that federal audits were an overreach of power. When the audit agency sent officers to Oaxaca, Mr. Murat blocked them. The auditors gained access only after a legal battle that went all the way to the Supreme Court, but by then Mr. Murat had left office. His tenure would never be fully audited.Over the years, Mr. Murat and his family have periodically faced questions about their finances.In a recent email to The Times, Mr. Murat said: ""As is widely known in Mexico, my family and the family of my wife who passed away in 2000 have many assets and sources of income. This patrimony has been built up over generations through hard work and is unrelated to my public service.""Documents and interviews show that over his career Mr. Murat was paid modest salaries in party jobs and that he did some work as a private lawyer. Around the time he first won election as a federal legislator in the 1970s, he reported total earnings of 25,000 pesos, or about $1,100 a month. His salary as governor reached just over $11,500 a year -- plus a bonus whose amount was not disclosed.His brother-in-law, Mateo Jiménez, said that the Murat family was ""more or less middle class"" and that he knew of no large inheritances from Mr. Murat's parents. Early in José's political career, he said, Mr. Murat's mother sold housewares from her home.When Mr. Murat was governor, Proceso, a Mexico City magazine, wrote that he and his deputies experienced ""inexplicable enrichment."" He had a particularly rough relationship with the local newspaper Noticias, which published an article questioning where his mother, Juana Casab, had gotten her money.Ericel Gómez Nucamendi, the paper's publisher, said in an interview that he believed the governor had long held a grudge against him for refusing his request to purchase part of his newspaper. ""He wanted to grab the newspaper,"" said Mr. Gómez, who is now a politician in Oaxaca. ""He offered to buy it and return it to me when he was no longer governor.""Another local businessman, Humberto López Lena, said in an interview that Mr. Murat proposed that he act as a proxy to gain a share of businesses in Oaxaca. Mr. López Lena said that soon after Mr. Murat was elected, the governor said: ""You have a good image and you can be my rep.""Mr. López Lena said Mr. Murat asked him several more times, and he repeatedly turned him down.Recently, Mr. Murat has been drawn into a controversy involving two other former governors, including his friend from the 1970s, Mr. Herrera of Veracruz. It centers on accusations brought in a lawsuit by an activist and lawyer from Chiapas who alleged that the former governor of that state improperly steered state business to construction companies. The lawyer, Horacio Culebro, has said that Mr. Murat and Mr. Herrera have an interest in those companies.In summer 2013, opposition legislators urged prosecutors to look into the allegations, with one saying, ""what we see is a large network of corruption involving ex-governors."" A federal tribunal is deciding whether a state attorney general must review the evidence. Mr. Herrera and Mr. Murat have denied any involvement. Meanwhile, Mr. Culebro said in a deposition that he had received threats via cellphone and Facebook. ""I hold José Murat Casab and Fidel Herrera Beltrán responsible for anything that may happen to me,"" he said.Responding to written questions about his governorship -- including the allegations by Mr. López Lena, Mr. Gómez and Mr. Culebro -- Mr. Murat wrote in an email: ""Most of your questions are based on the libelous and false assumption that I have done something corrupt. As such they do not merit a response.""Purchases in the U.S.Mr. Murat and his family purchased property in the United States throughout his long political career. In 1984, Mr. Murat and his brother, Karim, bought a condominium on Texas's South Padre Island, a resort town popular with Mexicans, according to public property records.The purchase followed a familiar course taken by many Mexicans of means.""The U.S. and maybe Switzerland are the two main places where Mexican wealth has been deposited,"" said Mauricio Cano, a Mexico City lawyer who wrote a book titled ""Game Theory and Tax Evasion"" and advised friends of Mr. Murat on a Manhattan real estate deal.Soon after buying the South Padre Island condo, the Murat brothers purchased a house nearby, in Brownsville. In both instances, they listed only their maternal surname on the deeds -- meaning José Murat's name appears as ""José M. Casab.""The deeds, on file in Cameron County, list their sister's address in Brownsville, where her husband owns a building used for a nightclub. In political filings and other public records, Mr. Murat has alternated between using ""Casab"" and the more common Mexican surname ""Casas.""By the 1990s, The Times found, Mr. Murat's brother, Karim, and his mother, Juana, had begun buying properties in Michigan, where she had relatives. They have four properties there between them -- a modest suburban home, a condo, land and commercial property. A cousin, Alfredo Casab, a lawyer in Michigan, confirmed that Karim and Juana were related to the former governor.Just as Mr. Murat's term as governor was drawing to a close in 2004, his children purchased the condos in Park City, Utah, where the family likes to ski, and put their names on the deeds.Mexicans are among those who have been increasingly using shell companies and trusts to move money abroad, said Geralda Buckley Kral, a wealth adviser based in Zurich. Such mechanisms provide privacy, yet can also enable a person to deny ownership. ""If he gets questioned about these assets, he can legally say he doesn't own it because he doesn't own it in his name,"" she said.Ms. Kral said that she helped set up a trust for a Mexican family named Herrera that was used in 2007 to purchase a condo at 40 West 55th St., a small building just off Fifth Avenue, near the Museum of Modern Art and Central Park. The deed lists the name of a son of Fidel Herrera, Mr. Murat's friend, as a representative of the shell company that bought the condo.After the apartments were upgraded and converted to condos in 2007, the Herreras and four other Mexican families scooped up five units for a total of $6.1 million. ""They were all friends of friends,"" said Louise Phillips Forbes, a broker at Halstead Property who handled the sales.""I have over the years placed many, many wealthy Mexican families, and their philosophy has been that many of them were educated in the States and many of them hold a residence here,"" Ms. Forbes said. ""They're home working, but they come all the time.""Alejandro Murat's wife, Ivette Morán, purchased Unit 6C, according to New York City property records. Next to her apartment, the records show, is a unit purchased by Melissa F. Alcántara, the daughter of José Murat's longtime girlfriend.Upstairs is a unit owned by a shell company, but property records include the name of a son of Fernando Margáin, the former mayor of San Pedro Garza García in northern Mexico. Another owner in the building is Víctor Manuel Álvarez Puga, who ran an accounting firm in Mexico.Despite public records containing their names, sons of both Mr. Herrera and Mr. Margáin told The Times they were simply doing legal work for the actual owners, whom they would not identify. But in both cases, family members registered telephones to the units.For the Murats, the 55th Street condo meant they now had two places to stay in New York. ""The Time Warner came before 40 West 55th Street,"" Ms. Forbes said. ""Alejandro's family owns in Time Warner.""The Time Warner condo used by the Murats is owned by a shell company called Nivea Management, which was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. The condo, purchased for $1.76 million, was one of two sold together on Jan. 12, 2004; the other cost $3.68 million. But figuring out whose money is behind any shell company is difficult.John Zampino, the lawyer who set up both companies, declined to identify the buyers, saying his job called for discretion. ""It's a very delicate situation, and I can be criticized,"" he said. ""I can't even say who I represent.""Both transactions were handled by the Ira Berman real estate law firm. The firm did ""robo-signing for the rich"" and did not check the backgrounds of buyers, according to a former lawyer there, who asked not to be named out of concerns for his reputation. Mr. Berman, who has since served a prison term for day-trading with his clients' escrow money, declined to discuss whether his firm did background checks of its clients and said he did not recall the Time Warner sales.Soozy Katzen, a real estate agent at Fox Residential Group who handles rentals for one of the two condos, said, ""There's no way you're going to reach the owners. They buy under corporate names to not reveal who they are.""But she did say that the owner of the condo on the 57th floor, after originally planning to rent the unit, let his son use it instead.In fact, Alejandro Murat, who was then in graduate school at Columbia, began using that condo, according to records reviewed by The Times. José Murat confirmed that his son lived there in the summer of 2005.As for the ownership of the condo, people with knowledge of the building said they were told it was purchased by a group of Mexicans, including a businessman named Guillermo Vogel Hinojosa.José Murat said in response to questions that the condo was owned by Mr. Vogel. Mr. Vogel, who declined to discuss the properties, is a cousin of Mr. Murat's deceased wife.The Housing ChiefProtesters gathered outside Oaxaca's grand 16th-century church in 2013, as friends and family flowed into a baptism and first communion ceremony for Alejandro Murat's daughters.""Repudiate José Murat"" a sign said, according to news reports at the time. Another called José Murat a ""two-legged rat,"" Mexican slang for thief.The Murats spend much of their time outside Oaxaca, but as Alejandro has risen as a contender to be Oaxaca's next governor, some old tensions over the family are being stirred.It remains an open question in political circles how independent the son is of the father.""Alejandro has his own merits and his father's figure may even be uncomfortable at times,"" said Dulce María Sauri, a former national leader of the PRI.Alejandro Murat practiced law for a few years before working for the State of Mexico, where Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, and then becoming head of Infonavit, which administers loans and mortgages to a large number of Mexican workers.All the while, the family has taken steps that obscure the ownership of several holdings in the United States.Alejandro Murat's wife, Ivette Morán, had purchased the $1.18 million condo on West 55th Street using her maternal surname. The deed reads ""Ivette M. Rodríguez,"" but in one place it lists ""Morán"" under her signature.In 2011, while her husband was working for the State of Mexico, Ms. Morán transferred the property at no cost to a trust called Himo Ltd. That transfer was handled by Mr. Zampino, the lawyer who also set up the shell company that owns the Time Warner condo used by the Murats. (Mr. Zampino told The Times that he never worked for the family.)In a statement provided through the housing agency, Alejandro Murat said the 55th Street condo is owned by his uncle, José Hinojosa. Mr. Hinojosa's name is on the forwarding address for a temporary mortgage placed on the condo, but Ivette Morán Rodríguez is listed as the borrower. She is also listed on the deed as the president of the Himo trust, and she signed the line for the buyer.Alejandro Murat's statement also said the Florida condo is owned by his mother-in-law. But when the condo was transferred into a trust in late 2013, his wife was listed as the trustee. There have been two mortgages on the condo, one signed by Alejandro Murat and his wife, and the other signed by his wife.Late last year, the day after The Times contacted the Murats with an additional interview request, José Murat's four children transferred their Utah condos into shell companies. Both companies -- XILA Company and LOMA AEAI -- were incorporated in Florida in 2013 by Alejandro Murat's wife. The forwarding address for one company was the Florida condominium.José Murat's youngest daughter, Lorena, has been the most recent Murat at the Time Warner Center, living there for two years and studying fashion at Parsons the New School for Design. She now runs a fashion blog called The Fancy Archive. The site's registration lists the Time Warner condo as its base.To contact the reporters, email louise@nytimes.com or alejandraxanic@gmail.com.Design, graphics and production by Tom Giratikanon, Mika Gröndahl, Josh Keller, Yuliya Parshina-Kottas, Graham Roberts, Shreeya Sinha, Rumsey Taylor and Jeremy White.Towers of Secrecy: Fourth of five articles.; Articles in this series are examining the rising use of shell companiesto buy high-end real estate in the United States, and the hiddenowners behind them.

Behaviorists Show the U.S. How to Nudge:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The federal government found a clever way to make a little extra money last summer.Some vendors who provide federal agencies with goods and services as varied as paper clips and translators were given a slightly different version of the form used to report rebates they owe the government.The only difference: The signature box was at the beginning of the form rather than the end. The result: a rash of honesty. Companies using the new form acknowledged they owed an extra $1.59 million in rebates during the three-month experiment, apparently because promising to be truthful at the outset actually caused them to answer more truthfully.The altered form is among the early successes of a year-old effort by the Obama administration to apply academic research on human behavior to the business of running a government. The idea is that a little science might help the government collect taxes, distribute benefit payments and even help people find jobs, get an education or save for retirement.This month, the White House announced the creation of a Social and Behavioral Sciences Team to lead this push, and President Obama issued an executive order encouraging agencies to conduct their own experiments.""The goal is to help people who want to take a given step but may face some barriers,"" said Maya Shankar, the Oxford-educated scientist who leads the team. ""You can do everything to make sure that a program is well designed, but if it's not getting into the hands of people who are supposed to be benefiting from it, everything up to that point was for naught.""Governments generally operate on the assumption that people are rational. One of the basic implications of mainstream economic theory is that public policy works best when people are treated as rational decision makers.Yet a growing body of research has found that people are not only irrational on occasion, but they tend to be irrational in some consistent and predictable ways. People tend to be influenced by the last thing they heard. They tend to fear losses more than they like profits. They tend to be a little lazy.And researchers from this new school argue the government should account for these tendencies.""Almost any domain that they let us go in, we could figure out some way of making at least modest improvements in what they're doing,"" said the University of Chicago economist Richard Thaler, one of the founders of behavioral economics and a leading advocate of governments making use of what he calls ""nudges.""Ms. Shankar and her team of 15 -- including psychologists, economists and sociologists -- conducted about a dozen experiments over the last year to prove the value of the approach, but so far the successes remain small. The rebate forms, for example, increased revenue by about 6 percent.Moreover, nudges are hard to mass-produce. The British government, which created a ""nudge unit"" in 2010, found it could increase collections from delinquent taxpayers by telling them nine in 10 neighbors had paid up, a common marketing technique. But when the United States Treasury Department tried a similar technique last year, it did not work.And changing behavior is tricky. The most important change behavioral economics has made in federal policy is a 2006 law that made it easier for companies to enroll workers in retirement plans by default. The change has increased participation, but it also may have reduced the amounts some people have saved. People enrolled by default also tend to stick with the default savings rate, often lower than the average for people who sign up themselves.""Is the government really competent to determine the directions in which we should be nudged?"" asked John Cochrane, a Stanford University economist.Mr. Cochrane said the administration's experiments so far seem basically harmless -- ""government spam, messaging people to tell them to do x or y or z."" But he said he was troubled by the possibility of more forceful nudges devised by technocrats influenced by lobbyists or other political considerations.""The case for the free market is not that each individual's choices are perfect,"" he wrote in a recent blog post. ""The case for the free market is long and sorry experience that government bureaucracies are pretty awful at making choices for people.""Still, behavioral scientists have won the attention of policy makers partly by holding out the promise of improvements at very little cost. Nudges are cheap. The idea that tweaking a tax-collection letter might bring in as much money as hiring tax collectors is deeply appealing in an era of austerity.""I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being, in happiness, in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money,"" David Cameron, the British prime minister who created the first ""nudge unit,"" said during his 2010 campaign.An early victory: The British team found people who had not registered vehicles were more likely to do so if they were sent a picture of the car beside the standard warning it could be taken away.Civil servants in Britain are being trained in behavioral science, and the governments of Australia, Denmark and South Africa are among those dabbling in nudgery. The British program, spun out of the government, was recently hired by Bloomberg Philanthropies to work with American cities. The World Bank is mulling the lessons for economic development.Ms. Shankar's team asks federal agencies about their priorities, then mines the academic literature for ways to improve those policies. The team also has created a network of academic institutions to provide advice.The adjusted rebate forms, for example, were inspired by a 2012 study. Researchers similarly adjusted the form sent to customers of an auto insurance company asking them to report how many miles they had driven. Those asked to sign at the top reported driving about 2,400 more miles.(The persistence of these effects is an open question. The first time a person signs, they answer the questions more honestly, but by the 10th time, the nudge might be powerless. Ms. Shankar said there had been ""a little dip"" in rebate payments since last summer, but the effect remained quite strong. Mr. Thaler noted that alarm clocks wake people up every morning.)Perhaps even more than new ideas, the behavioral group is bringing a new approach to government. Experimentation is the key: Different nudges are tried systematically, results are quantified and, even after the best approach is selected, the team goes back to see how things are working.The team, for example, created eight versions of an email encouraging members of the military to enroll in a retirement savings program. About 80,000 service members received each version. The most effective, which combined step-by-step instructions with an example of how much a person could save by putting away a little money each month, roughly doubled enrollment rates.These efforts are informed by common sense as much as academic insight. People are more likely to do things that are easier to do. Yet simplicity has rarely been a priority in the development of federal programs. ""They've been more worried about making sure it's legally perfect than making sure it's understandable to anybody,"" Mr. Thaler said. ""So there's a lot of room to simplify things.""Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.",0.0

"Rapping, and Settling Scores:   [The Arts/Cultural Desk ]",,"TORONTO -- This year's OVO Fest truly began about three hours before Drake took the stage at the Molson Canadian Amphitheatre here on Monday night, when a picture of him preparing for the concert while wearing a Free Meek Mill T-shirt slipped onto the Internet.Over the last two weeks, Drake and Meek Mill have been engaged in a war of words, a rarity in hip-hop these days and a referendum on the genre's evolving value systems. Meek Mill accused Drake of using a ghostwriter on a song they recently collaborated on, something Meek Mill and his traditionalist values couldn't abide. He probably saw Drake -- a rapper who also sings and freely emotes and generally isn't much preoccupied with the tenets of the genre as it was in harsher times -- as an easy target no one had yet hit squarely.In February, Drake released ""If You're Reading This It's Too Late,"" which is heavy with the stresses of life at hip-hop's top. It's easily the most anxious, resentful and muscled music Drake has ever made -- the stuff of fighting, not retreating.So Meek Mill shouldn't have been surprised when Drake replied to his provocations with a pair of songs, ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back,"" that tackled him head-on. And he shouldn't have been surprised when Drake opened his performance on Monday, the third and last night of the festival that carries his label's name, with those songs. During ""Back to Back,"" the huge screen behind Drake played an endless scroll of memes insulting Meek Mill, the kind found all over Instagram and Twitter in recent weeks. Online, this would have been called a slide show, or click bait; here, it was a bludgeon.This was the sixth time Drake has hosted OVO Fest here in his hometown, and with this year's performance, he fully turned the annual show into his personal Summer Jam. In years past, the festival carried a heavy dose of local pride and special guests galore; this year, it offered all that and also a place for the host to settle scores.Drake's addressing of Meek Mill played like ""If You're Reading This"" come to life. But later in the night, too, he remained focused almost exclusively on the tougher parts of his catalog -- bionic choruses, punchy rapping, almost no singing to speak of. Notably, he performed only three songs released prior to December 2013. Before then, he was still toggling between hard and soft identities. Those songs were also the only tracks released commercially on one of his studio albums (if you accept that ""If You're Reading This"" is a mixtape -- a commercially released mixtape -- as Drake has said).The Drake of the last 20 or so months has been extremely prolific, releasing songs -- individually or in small batches, some originals, some remixes -- that have revealed new sides to his creative approach. As a result, his career is best understood not in terms of eras but in terms of moments. (The same is true of his merchandise. If you went to the OVO store during the festival, you could buy a T-shirt with an image of a fully charged iPhone battery on the back, a reference to ""Charged Up."")Which explains why, even though a migraine tension permeated ""If You're Reading This,"" every song Drake has released in the last few weeks, even the ones taking aim at Meek Mill, has found him sounding casual, like someone who's learned how to breathe evenly amid tumult.A self-aware oversharer, Drake is the ideal musician for an era of relentless self-documentation. He's not waiting around to deliver grand statements; he'd much rather detail his journey bit by bit, which is why even a show like this, largely restricted to the current phase of his career, can still contain multitudes: pugnacious tracks from ""If You're Reading This""; levelheaded Meek Mill disses; exuberant guest verses on songs by Big Sean and Nicki Minaj; clever remixes of Fetty Wap's ""My Way,"" ILoveMakonnen's ""Tuesday"" and D.R.A.M.'s ""Cha Cha,"" which Drake has remade as ""Hotline Bling,"" a standout reggae-lite song about an old flame gone cold.Twice Drake ceded the stage for long stretches to artists he described as his idols. First came the undeniable Kanye West, who for a half-hour performed some of his most aggrieved material -- ""New Slaves,"" ""Black Skinhead,"" ""Can't Tell Me Nothing"" -- under a phalanx of spotlights. Even as he was clearly losing his voice, he kept shouting. Mr. West is a case study for how hip-hop success can toughen even the most nuanced artists. The puffed-chest persona that Drake is projecting now? Mr. West has been there twice, maybe three times. No rapper is more experienced at navigating the skepticism of others than he is, to the point at which he no longer responds with outbursts and indignation, but instead knowing smiles.Later came Pharrell Williams, the superproducer turned unexpected recent pop star. Unlike Mr. West, a stage natural who's completely free with his body, Mr. Williams was tightly wound. He looked uncomfortable rapping older songs, only loosening up when singing more recent material, like ""Get Lucky,"" his nu-disco collaboration with Daft Punk, and his new single, ""Freedom"" -- which is somewhere between swing jazz and Soho's ""Hot Music."" On ""Freedom,"" Mr. Williams shrieked like Little Richard and was met with a palpable lack of interest. At no point during the night was the crowd quieter.Together, Mr. Williams, Mr. West and Drake constitute a genuine alternative history of hip-hop's development, one that favors nonmacho creative eccentrics and bypasses the typical binaries: gangster vs. conscious, mainstream vs. underground. All three are stars who have found grace in the in-between spaces.Their success has also opened doors for others, whether someone like Future, whose mainstream acceptance was kick-started by a Drake remix four years ago and who made a surprise appearance here early Monday night, or J. Cole, who headlined the festival's previous night with his sometimes awkward, sometimes convincing declarations of modesty.Mr. West and Mr. Williams also encapsulate the two main paths available to an artist like Drake once he peaks. Mr. West remains a provocateur, not eager to jump into fights but with no problem starting them. Mr. Williams, on the other hand, exudes Zen, as if he exists on a plane just high enough to miss the details of what's happening down below but not so high that he can't be seen.Drake, the onetime softy, is not choosing the easy route. At the end of the night, he performed a string of songs from ""If You're Reading This"" (with a quick return to ""Back to Back"" sprinkled in). Included were ""Know Yourself"" and ""10 Bands"": In recent days, reference demos for both songs recorded by Quentin Miller, the ghostwriter Meek Mill named, were leaked online. (If Drake had brought Mr. Miller out onstage at this point, that might have been the ultimate act of power and defiance.)And there were other taunts, too. Drake teased ""3Peat,"" an as-yet-unreleased song dissing Meek Mill. At the end of ""Know Yourself,"" he brought out dozens of his friends to chant the song's chorus, a display of unity and strength (and something of a warning). And when he performed ""Energy,"" he sang some parts of it, including the refrain ""got a lot of enemies,"" as if to demonstrate that softening the delivery didn't soften the content, or the man, one bit.Photograph Drake: The Rapper at Ovo Fest in Toronto, His Hometown, Where He Performed New Songs and Took Shots at His Rival Meek Mill.

Emails Expand on Mosaic of Secretary Clinton's Days:   [National Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- A new batch of emails released on Friday portray Hillary Rodham Clinton when she was secretary of state, dealing with everything from political unrest in Honduras and a freeze on Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories to minor details of her schedule and even a shipment of apples to her office.She discussed the qualities of job candidates: ""It goes w/out saying that someone lacks discretion is not possible,"" she wrote in 2009 during a search for a speechwriter -- while her closest aides lavished praise on her (""Secretary of Awesome"" was the subject line of one email from her chief of staff, Cheryl D. Mills) and kept her up-to-date on her image in the media. Other emails she received sought privileged access and favors, and in one, the wife of the former prime minister of Britain, Tony Blair, passed on a résumé for a young man applying for a job.In all, this second cache of emails that Mrs. Clinton sent and received during 2009 and parts of 2010, released by the State Department by court order, added 1,356 new tiles to the mosaic of her tenure in President Obama's cabinet. And the monthly release of the emails prescribed by the court ensures that her handling of her electronic correspondence will be updated throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.Last week the inspectors general of the State Department and the nation's intelligence agencies disclosed that they had discovered classified information on the private email account that Mrs. Clinton used, stating that such material should not have been stored outside secure government computer systems -- in this case, on a server she kept at her house.Mrs. Clinton has maintained that none of the information on her server had been classified, though the State Department classified dozens of documents after the emails were released, first on June 30 and again on Friday. In one email released on Friday, Huma Abedin, a close adviser, forwarded a note written by an aide to the former British foreign minister, David Miliband, that ""he doesn't want to send through the system.""Five pages that follow have been redacted entirely, and marked classified until 20 years after Nov. 21, 2009, when the note was forwarded to Mrs. Clinton. The aide, Matthew Gould, said that Mr. Miliband had just returned from Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and ""very much wants the secretary (only) to see this note"" and to ""talk it over with her"" as soon as possible.It was not clear that it was among the emails cited by the inspectors general.A note on the email said it had been classified only on Thursday. It and other emails that were released show that Mrs. Clinton and her aides exchanged notes and memos on all sorts of diplomatic matters, from negotiations with the Russians at a time the Obama administration was seeking to improve relations with the Kremlin to the discussions over the Israeli settlement freeze in 2009.""Abu Mazen wants to see it,"" Mrs. Clinton said, referring to the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, in response to an email from another close aide, Jacob J. Sullivan.Like the disclosure of tens of thousands of emails by WikiLeaks in 2010, the release of these emails has provided granular details of diplomacy that would normally would not become public for years, if ever.""Many thx for your kind note,"" the former American ambassador to Baghdad, Christopher R. Hill, responded when Mrs. Clinton praised the work he was doing. ""I wish I felt better about iraqis as a result, but I truly remain worried about these people. They are truly a collective pain in the neck.""Many of the notes involved mundane logistical matters, such as ensuring that her office had the New York State apples Mrs. Clinton liked.Others offered telling insights into the issues and personalities she encountered on the job.Dozens of the emails involved appointments to various positions in the State Department, with people lobbying for themselves and others -- or sometimes against them. Ivo Daalder, a former ambassador to NATO, sent one email detailing ""three major reasons"" why one candidate was ""not the right person for the job."" The name, like all of the potential appointees, is redacted, as was the position in question.The emails underscored the privileged status of having Mrs. Clinton's direct address. Strobe Talbott, the former deputy secretary of state who now heads the Brookings Institution, wrote to her directly, expressing concerns that ""time-sensitive messages"" were not getting through Ms. Mills's State Department email.Mr. Blair's wife, Cherie, used the personal address at least a dozen times in 2009, pressing Mrs. Clinton to meet with ""my friend,"" Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al-Missned, a Qatari royal, and praising Mrs. Clinton's work.With the subject line ""No longer homicidal,"" Mrs. Clinton wrote to Ms. Mills about Mark Penn, who was her pollster and chief strategist when she was a presidential candidate in 2008, who had earlier conducted polling for a former prime minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra.""Could you try to contact Mark Penn to confirm he no longer represents Thaksin before I call Thai PM at 9:30?"" Mrs. Clinton wrote.Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.",0.0
A Play Space for Rhythm Set on the High Seas:   [Review ],,"In ""Cambuyón,"" a percussive dance and music show that opened at the New Victory Theater on Friday, rhythm comes from many sources: wooden crates, metal buckets, matchsticks, glass bottles, kitchen utensils, feet slapping the floor and hands slapping the body. The concept bears more than a little resemblance to ""Stomp,"" but in this production by Enlace Servicios Culturales, a company based in the Canary Islands and in Barcelona, all of the tapping and clanging happens aboard a ship whose location in time and space remains open to interpretation.What century are we in? What hemisphere? Does it matter? Created with young audiences in mind -- a solid under-12 contingent turned out for opening night -- ""Cambuyón"" sets out to explore the cultural cross-pollination engendered by sea travel. This proves less a historical concern than an excuse to smash together lots of different styles -- clogging, tap, hip-hop, salsa -- in one rambunctious, fast-paced, frayed-around-the-edges hour.Rudimentary projections by Jonatan Rodríguez, who is also one of the seven performers, situate us, at the outset, somewhere along the coast of England. (The show's title comes from the phrase ""Come Buy On,"" which, according to the program, British ships would display when selling goods at Spanish ports.) The first of 12 awkwardly linked scenes features a foot-music battle between two scruffy men: Thanos Daskalopoulos, who wears wooden slabs on the soles of his shoes, and Jep Meléndez, one of the company's artistic directors, in tap shoes. As Raúl Cabrera, the cast's most skilled vocalist, sings a hornpipe, Mr. Meléndez insists on breaking out of their upright routine with looser improvisations. Mr. Daskalopoulos, getting exasperated, eventually sheds his clunky footwear to keep up. Thus we zoom through the evolution of tap in a single costume change.Another contest goes down in the next scene between the sisters Clara and Berta Pons, who introduce popping, locking and other stop-motion snaking moves into the mix. These will resurface in the finale, when the deck of the ship is most like a playground.For all its roughness, ""Cambuyón"" is elegant in its commitment to simple means of generating complex rhythms. Mr. Cabrera supplies an entire jazz band with his vocal cords (he does a good trombone); Mr. Meléndez, in an intricate solo, juggles a polyrhythmic orchestra within his limbs. The show tries hard, sometimes too hard, to entertain, but that didn't seem to matter to all the laughing, cheering kids in the audience.""Cambuyón"" continues through Feb. 22 at the New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan; 646-223-3010, newvictory.org.Photograph CambuyóN: In Foreground, Thanos Daskalopoulos, Left, and Jep MeléNdez Find Rhythm From Many Sources at the New Victory Theater.

"On Probation, Lives Can Run Far Off Track:   [National Desk ]",,"BALTIMORE -- On Christmas Day in 2013, Donyelle Hall and her husband, Roland Jr., gave a party for friends and family at their apartment. Mrs. Hall, a nurse's aide for the severely disabled, had recently taken a college course in medical terminology to improve her earning potential. Mr. Hall worked as a kitchen manager. The two had married the year before.Mrs. Hall had gifts ready for each guest -- pajamas for her mother, new boots for her two grown sons. Well before midnight, the party wound down, and Mrs. Hall, who had been drinking wine, got in the car with her husband to drive two guests home. She was 40 at the time, had zero points for bad driving on her license, and had never been in trouble with the law. That was about to change.She was stopped for speeding, failed a breathalyzer test, and was charged with drunken driving. She pleaded guilty in exchange for entering a probation program under which, provided she followed the rules, she would avoid a conviction.But over the next 18 months, Mrs. Hall would find herself in trouble again and again, though she committed no new crimes. She spent countless hours attending court and lost thousands of dollars in fees, legal costs and wages, as well as two jobs. The judge handling her case imposed conditions far harsher than the norm, then repeatedly called Mrs. Hall into court for violations like failing to ask permission before moving to a different unit in her apartment complex.Ultimately Mrs. Hall spent more than a month in jail because she could not afford another $2,500 to bail herself out.Mrs. Hall's misdemeanor, one of more than a million drunken-driving arrests each year, is not one that would normally attract attention. No one was injured and no property was damaged, and most courts do not come down hard on first-time offenders in drunken-driving cases. Yet as more states turn to probation and parole as a means of reducing incarceration, her story shows how even a supposedly light punishment like probation can severely disrupt a working-class life and weigh heavily on its prospects.While Mrs. Hall's case is extreme, she is far from alone in struggling under the burden of an unusually strict or inappropriate probation, experts say. ""There are a number of people around the country being put on probation that don't really need to be on probation,"" said Carl Wicklund, the executive director of the American Parole and Probation Association, a professional group. ""It's a bad use of resources, and it's bad for the individual."" Nationally, only about two-thirds of probationers successfully complete their terms, according to federal data.At its worst, the criminal justice system can backfire on a stable, nonviolent defendant like Mrs. Hall, said Edward Latessa, director of the School of Criminal Justice at the University of Cincinnati. ""If I took you and locked you up for 30 days, what would happen?"" he said. ""You'd lose your job, you might lose your apartment, you end up with a criminal record. I don't help you -- I give you new risk factors.""It was, Mrs. Hall now says, a learning experience. When pressed about what, exactly, she had learned, she replied: ""I've learned that the system is no good.""A Christmas EncounterMrs. Hall's odyssey began that Christmas evening, when a police officer pulled her over for going 38 miles an hour in a 25-m.p.h. zone. The officer said that Mrs. Hall was slurring her words and that her breath smelled of alcohol. She first denied drinking, the police report said, then admitted to having had some wine. When given a field sobriety test that checks for an involuntary jerking of the eyes, the officer wrote, Mrs. Hall refused to open hers. (The test was voluntary -- drivers have the right to decline.) On a form used to assess Mrs. Hall's demeanor, the police checked off ""talkative,"" ""cocky,"" ""antagonistic"" and ""confused.""The Halls have a different version of events. Mr. Hall said that his wife was not speeding, and that the officer refused to show him the display on the speed detector. When he questioned the stop, he said, the officer threatened to arrest him, too. Mrs. Hall said she did not refuse to open her eyes, but bright lights caused her to squint.The officers arrested Mrs. Hall and took her to jail, where she agreed to take a breathalyzer test. Again, she ran into trouble. She failed three times to blow hard enough into the machine. Breathalyzers can be more difficult, and less accurate, for people as short as Mrs. Hall, who is five feet tall, because they have less lung capacity than average. Finally, on her fourth attempt, she completed the test, which showed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.09. In Maryland, 0.07 is considered ""impaired.""For a woman of Mrs. Hall's weight, assuming drinks were consumed over a four-hour period, the difference between 0.06, considered ""neutral,"" and 0.09 would have been about one glass of wine, according to Leonard R. Stamm, a Maryland defense lawyer who specializes in drunken-driving cases.A Mound of Costs and FeesIn Maryland, many first-time drunken-driving defendants are released on their own recognizance, particularly if no one was hurt. But Mrs. Hall's bail was set by a court commissioner at $25,000.A bail bondsman charged Mr. Hall $2,000, payable in monthly installments, to post bond, and Mrs. Hall was released in less than 24 hours. Everyone assured her the case was minor.Drunken-driving penalties vary widely depending on the judge, but Mr. Stamm said a typical sentence for a first offense might be a year of unsupervised probation. Most judges will offer what in Maryland is called ""probation before judgment,"" or P.B.J., in which a defendant's guilty plea is set aside. If the defendant violates probation, the judge may reimpose the conviction and sentence the person under the original offense -- in Mrs. Hall's case, up to 60 days in jail. If the defendant is successful, she avoids a criminal conviction.As expected, the prosecutor offered Mrs. Hall probation before judgment in exchange for a guilty plea. But Judge Joan Bossmann Gordon of Maryland District Court in Baltimore balked over what she viewed as Mrs. Hall's lack of cooperation with the police. After taking a recess to consider the matter, she agreed to the plea deal ""against my better judgment.""Typically, drunken-driving defendants get a professional assessment to determine what kind of treatment they need: a 26-hour class for ""problem drinkers"" or a 12-hour class for ""social drinkers."" Mrs. Hall denies having a drinking problem, and there is nothing in her record to suggest otherwise.But Judge Gordon did not wait for an assessment. She sentenced Mrs. Hall to 18 months supervised probation, costing her $105 a month in fees for probation and drunken-driving monitoring. She also ordered Mrs. Hall to attend 26 weeks of alcohol education at $70 a week and three Alcoholics Anonymous meetings a week.All told, Mrs. Hall was looking at fees of $385 a month, her lawyer's fee of $1,500, fines and court costs totaling $252.50 and the $2,000 bail bond.Still, her financial situation was about to get worse -- in April, the Motor Vehicle Administration suspended Mrs. Hall's driver's license for 14 days. The suspension contributed, Mrs. Hall said, to the loss of her job at a rehabilitation center 20 miles away.A Judge's ConditionsFor several months, Mrs. Hall complied with the numerous conditions of her probation. She found a new, lower-paying job, met with her probation officer, completed her alcohol counseling, and attended the A.A. meetings, which proved eye-opening.""At first it was very inspiring thinking, oh my goodness, you know, they didn't believe in God and now they do,"" Mrs. Hall said. ""They lost their homes and their kids. They lost so much, and I learned so much.""But then it got depressing because you had people in there stating that, you know, one guy was like, he was molested by his dad, and he don't trust any men now, he do drugs, and he drink, and I mean, he can't go home -- it was just so much.""And then when they'd get around to me, I'm like, 'I'm just happy to be here, thank you for letting me share.' ""Judge Gordon had imposed one particularly unusual condition on Mrs. Hall: She could not move without the judge's permission.So when Mrs. Hall's apartment developed a mouse infestation and she made arrangements to change units, she wrote to the judge on Aug. 19. ""I, Donyelle Hall, will be moving on the first of the month, Sept. 1,"" she wrote. She provided the new address, saying it was ""just around the corner from where I am now.""A few days later, the judge made two notes on the letter, both signed and dated: ""This is not a request for permission prior to moving."" And then: ""Defendant DOES NOT have permission to change her address."" On Sept. 19, a police officer knocked on Mrs. Hall's door and handed her a summons to a probation violation hearing.As it turned out, Mrs. Hall had not moved after all, because the new unit was not available. The summons had been served to her at her original address.But it would take her three and a half months, five court hearings, three letters from her landlord and a copy of her lease to convince the judge. Finally, Judge Gordon dismissed the violation, saying, ""At this point, ma'am, you have a clear understanding of what you can and cannot do on probation without getting permission.""Because probation is like a contract in which the defendant agrees to meet certain conditions in order to avoid incarceration, judges may impose ""lawful, rational and non-arbitrary"" conditions that intrude on the probationer's freedom, such as requiring drug treatment.But too many conditions set up probationers for failure, said Mr. Wicklund of the probation association.""One of the biggest challenges that probation has is having to deal with conditions of supervision that aren't relevant, they're not supported by research and they're not realistic,"" he said.Though Judge Gordon, a former prosecutor who was appointed in 2005, was hit by a drunken driver in the 1980s, according to the state Department of Public Safety website, she was not singling out Mrs. Hall. In April, Tanika Holmes, who had shattered a convenience store window, was forced to move when her brother, with whom she had been living, was evicted, according to court testimony. Ms. Holmes was jailed without bail for two weeks, lost her job, then went to live with an aunt. When the aunt, too, faced eviction, Ms. Holmes, 20, asked her public defender to request permission for her to move.""No, no, no, no,"" Judge Gordon said. ""You've had a really bad attitude through all of this, and I'm not going to authorize another change of address, so don't even think about it.""Judge Gordon declined, through a court spokeswoman, to be interviewed for this story. But in court, she offered Ms. Holmes a glimpse of her reasoning: ""The whole idea is to see if you can do things like follow rules, because if you can follow rules, then that gives the court some hope that you can do things like obey laws.""34 Days in a Bad JailAs Mrs. Hall's residency issue ground through the court, her compliance began to fray. In December, she was unable to provide the attendance slips that could prove she had been to her A.A. meetings.Mrs. Hall said she had lost track of the slips during November, when her scheduled probation meeting had been canceled. ""I'm very, very, very terrible at holding onto papers,"" she said. ""I put papers in my car, in certain pocketbooks, I have them in the glove compartment, on my dresser.""After giving Mrs. Hall two more chances, the probation officer reported the missing paperwork to Judge Gordon in February. This time, the judge issued a warrant for Mrs. Hall's arrest, setting bond in advance at $5,000 cash -- meaning no bondsman could be used. When the probation officer told Mrs. Hall about the warrant, she spent a few days hiding at her mother's house. She had only six months of probation left.Finally, she decided to turn herself in. On March 12, she went to jail, hoping the matter would be resolved quickly.The Baltimore City Detention Center is so bad that the governor recently ordered part of it shut down after a recent federal investigation of the jail resulted in 40 convictions. In June, a court filing by the American Civil Liberties Union detailed black mold, vermin infestations, filthy mattresses and prisoners who, lacking working toilets, were forced to defecate in plastic bags.The jail does not provide clean underwear, so prisoners wash their own in mop buckets and sinks. The shower was so filthy that Mrs. Hall often went unwashed. A fellow inmate was on her third drunken-driving offense, this time after fleeing an accident, but was serving only six months. ""She was getting ready to go home, and she had a hit and run!"" Mrs. Hall said. ""I was so upset I called my husband crying.""Finally, Mrs. Hall's hearing date came on April 1. Mr. Hall was there, with every A.A. attendance slip he could find. Mrs. Hall's probation agent was there, prepared to recommend, according to Mrs. Hall's public defender, Nila Bala, that Mrs. Hall be released. (A request for an interview with the agent was declined.) In a letter, her alcohol treatment counselor had written that Mrs. Hall had completed the course with ""excellent attendance"" and that she had frequently spoken of her A.A. meetings.But the hearing could not take place that day. The jail had failed to transport Mrs. Hall to court.Even so, Mr. Hall held out hope that the judge would relent. ""If you let her out,"" he thought, ""she might could get her job back."" Ms. Bala begged Judge Gordon to at least revisit the $5,000 cash bond, pointing out that her client had not missed a single court date and had turned herself in.""I have to treat her as a potential risk to public safety, given the underlying charge and the failure to attend A.A. meetings,"" Judge Gordon replied. She reduced the bond to $2,500 cash -- still too much for the Halls.""Tears just bust out from my eyes,"" Mr. Hall said. By this time he, too, had lost his job, for unrelated reasons, and was struggling to earn money catering and selling takeout dinners. The Halls were falling behind on rent, car payments, insurance and other bills, and had given up on the payments for a recently purchased vacation time share.""What is she being held for?"" Mr. Hall asked. ""Paperwork?""Finally, on April 14, Mrs. Hall appeared before the judge. By then, she had been locked up for 34 days.At first she wanted to argue that she had attended A.A. But public defenders say they have learned that, in Judge Gordon's courtroom, apology is the better strategy. ""She missed the violation and takes responsibility for that. That's on her,"" Ethan Frenchman, representing Mrs. Hall that day, told the judge.The judge reminded Mrs. Hall of her ""willful refusal to cooperate"" with the police, and then reiterated her belief that Mrs. Hall was an alcoholic. ""Ma'am, what are you going to do on your own to try to keep control of this drinking problem?""Mrs. Hall answered meekly. ""I want to continue my A.A. meetings. It was very helpful.""Judge Gordon ruled that Mrs. Hall could be released, but the conviction would be reimposed, saying, ""I think you've realized by now, ma'am that you're going to have a lifelong struggle with this.""And Still No EndMrs. Hall was ready to put the whole ordeal behind her and move on. But the fallout from that traffic stop 18 months ago refused to end. She received a letter from Maryland's Central Collections Unit, informing her that she still owed $1,806.97 to the state Division of Parole and Probation -- a bureaucratic error, her public defender said, that would take time to unravel.Far worse was another matter of which Mrs. Hall was unaware. The drunken-driving conviction had prompted an automatic six-month license suspension, rendering her unable to drive to work. The notification letters had never reached her, according to state records.Informed of the suspension by a reporter's phone call, Mrs. Hall went silent.

"With Debate and Convention, G.O.P. Looks to Reclaim Ohio Edge in 2016:   [National Desk ]",,"CLEVELAND -- When 17 presidential contenders converge on Cleveland to debate on Thursday, not a few party leaders will be shuddering at the prospect of a scene out of ""The Hunger Games."" Or perhaps a duel of insults dominated by Donald J. Trump.But Republican leaders are delighted by one aspect of the debate: the attention it will shower on Ohio, a state they hope to bring back into the Republican fold in the 2016 election. The ultimate bellwether state in presidential politics, Ohio is the site of next Thursday's debate because, just under a year from now, it will host the 2016 convention in the same Cleveland sports arena.""We will have thousands of Ohio Republican volunteers and activists converging on Cleveland next summer,"" said Mark R. Weaver, a Republican strategist in the state. ""They will be re-energized, signed up and ready to rock.""Besides firing up activists, Republicans are using the debate and the convention to woo Ohio's general-election voters -- who have unerringly picked every president since 1964 -- and highlight before millions of voters nationwide the state's economic resurgence, which the party credits to Republican leadership.""No Republican has ever gained the White House without carrying Ohio,"" said Matt Borges, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. ""You've got to be from Mars to not understand that.""Conservatives plan a ""Buckeye Boot Camp"" on the day of the debate here, training activists at the House of Blues. And around Ohio, more than a dozen paid organizers for the national party, who have moved to the state 15 months before the general election, plan debate-watching parties to help recruit volunteers.The top 10 candidates in national polls, who will debate next Thursday in prime time on Fox News, may include Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a late entry to the race who is enjoying the benefits of being a fresh face. The other candidates will square off in an undercard event in the afternoon.State and national party committees are already deep into planning for 2016 in Ohio. They are determined not to be overrun by the Democrats, who did a superior job of turning out voters in 2012, especially African-Americans in the state's big cities, and convincing a majority of Ohioans that their policies would be better for the economy.Democrats in Ohio conceded the boldness of Republicans planting their flag in Cleveland, a Democratic stronghold. But they denied it would win them new friends. ""They may show up in Ohio, but they still can't escape their message,"" said David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. ""That city will not be impressed by the views expressed in that debate.""Despite the intense television exposure of a national convention, the hoopla-driven events have proved to be poor predictors of a party's success in a state. Both Democrats and Republicans lost the battleground states where they picked their nominees three years ago.Still, many Republicans believe they can break the trend in Ohio. ""The fact we're in the field now preparing for November 2016, the fact we have the convention there -- our increased emphasis on Ohio will, I think, help us carry the state,"" said Ryan Mahoney, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee.The committee plans to ramp up from a dozen or so field organizers in Ohio to more than 200 by next year, a fivefold increase over 2012. That big footprint is inspired in part by President Obama's ground-up national campaigns. Rather than being based haphazardly around the state, the Republican organizers will be assigned to ""turfs,"" geographic areas where data crunchers have identified 8,000 to 12,000 ""persuadable"" voters.One goal: to persuade more Republicans to cast early ballots, a turnout-boosting strategy that Democrats have dominated.Mr. Obama's re-election campaign in Ohio stunned Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, by turning out more African-American voters than in 2008, despite a drop-off in enthusiasm for the president detected by Mr. Romney's pollsters.Mr. Obama's margin of victory in the state, just 103,000 votes out of more than 5 million, was driven in part by the 70,000 additional ballots cast by African-Americans compared with 2008, according to census data.A question for 2016 is whether blacks will turn out in such numbers without an African-American at the top of the ticket. ""Barack Obama was a unique figure in history and we know that,"" Mr. Pepper said. ""The good news is, we know who those voters are, and we'll engage all of our voters early and often.""Another potentially historic nominee, Hillary Rodham Clinton, could put together a somewhat different coalition in Ohio, drawing more women and middle-class voters. Recalling that she defeated Mr. Obama in the Ohio Democratic primary in 2008, her first presidential campaign, Mr. Pepper said, ""She drew votes out of red counties you wouldn't see Democrats drawing.""Ohio Republicans are also looking to their strong dominance of state politics to shape 2016. Besides Mr. Kasich, Republicans hold every statewide office, supermajorities in the Legislature and most congressional seats. The drubbing that Republicans handed Democrats in Ohio in the 2014 midterms, led by Mr. Kasich re-elected with 64 percent of the vote, depleted the Democratic bench of elected officials for future races. It also demoralized the grass roots.""We're in the tall cotton right now,"" said Mr. Borges, the state G.O.P. chairman. ""I don't see how things could be going any worse for Democrats, and we must take advantage of this opportunity.""His Democratic counterpart, Mr. Pepper, said the party is rebuilding in races this year for mayor and school board in Toledo, Akron and other cities. ""We think the message of the other side now is way off kilter from what Ohioans want,"" he said.By some accounts, a home-state convention is a double-edged sword, which may explain why Republicans have not won the state where they chose their nominee since 1992.""I think it fires up some Republican activists in the state,"" said Jo Ann Davidson, the national Republican committeewoman from Ohio. ""It might fire up the Democrats in the other direction.""Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.",0.0

"After Violence, U.S. Puts Sanctions on Burundi Officials and Their Rivals:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"NAIROBI, Kenya -- The United States imposed sanctions Monday against four men connected to a wave of violence in Burundi that has destabilized the central African nation and raised fears of all-out civil war.Hundreds of people have been killed in protests, mysterious attacks and a coup attempt in Burundi since its president, Pierre Nkurunziza, announced in April that he would run for a third term, despite many Burundians' saying it was illegal. He won that third term in July in an election that many Western officials said was flawed.""President Nkurunziza's pursuit of a third term in office has precipitated a humanitarian, economic, and security crisis,"" said a statement by Ned Price, spokesman of the National Security Council in Washington. ""Burundi is on the precipice, but there is a clear path available to Burundi's leaders to avoid further violence and reach a political solution.""The sanctions, which come after the European Union also imposed sanctions on some Burundian officials, are part of an executive order issued Monday singling out any individuals who ""threaten peace and security in Burundi, undermine democratic processes, or who are responsible for or complicit in human rights abuses.""Human rights groups have said that both government forces and rebel groups in Burundi have killed civilians. Bodies are often found on the streets of Bujumbura, the capital. Many victims show signs of torture. Others seem to be random killings.The United States government has been quite critical of Mr. Nkurunziza, but in an apparent effort to achieve some neutrality, the four people identified for immediate sanctions include two from the government and two from the opposition. They are: Alain Guillaume Bunyoni, minister of public security; Godefroid Bizimana, deputy director-general of the national police; Godefroid Niyombare, the leader of a coup attempt in May; and Cyrille Ndayirukiye, the deputy leader of the coup attempt. Their assets have been frozen and visas restricted.The United States and other Western governments have tried to push Mr. Nkurunziza into an inclusive dialogue with Burundi's political opposition. The White House said Monday in a statement that it calls on all parties to ""to live up to their commitments to participate in an internationally mediated dialogue outside of Burundi.""Analysts said that the influence of human rights groups on the Obama administration was a big reason the United States moved forward on the sanctions, and leading human rights observers seemed to be pleased.""The U.S. sanctions send a strong message that impunity for serious crimes is not acceptable,"" said Carina Tertsakian, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""We hope these sanctions will deter senior Burundian officials from ordering, carrying out or tolerating serious abuses in the future.""",0.0
"From Cheap Seats, ESPN Misses the Action:   [Sports Desk ]",,"When ESPN brought its announcing crew to Citi Field on Sunday for the Mets-Nationals game, I was leery of what would be accomplished by planting all three announcers in the bleachers, far from the traditional broadcast booth. It was not a very illuminating spot from which to call a game that would, with the Mets' victory, put them in a tie for first place with the Nationals.This had been destined to be an SNY game until ESPN exercised its right on July 17 to give a national prime-time slot to a game that was going to be shown locally.ESPN can select games on two weeks' notice for Sunday nights in August and September, which can irk fans who rely on the original afternoon start times. When they purchased their tickets, they expected to be home by dinnertime, not in time for a late-night snack. Is it fair? No. But it is the business we've all chosen as modern-day fans; powerful networks make choices that inconvenience us. Dissatisfaction with the move could have been principally responsible for the paid attendance of 35,374, well below the 42,996 for Saturday night.ESPN could have moved three other afternoon games (in Los Angeles, Baltimore and Cincinnati) but selected Nationals-Mets. It was, an ESPN spokesman said, ""the best game on the board out of the four possibilities."" So, Mets fans, shifting the game was really praise for your team's resurgence. Blame the prime-time start on Sandy Alderson -- he's finally fielded a winning team!Beyond inconvenience to fans at Citi Field was the shift's impact on viewers. When your games are called by a terrific group of announcers -- Gary Cohen, Ron Darling and Keith Hernandez of SNY -- who are worth watching whether the team is good or awful, do you want anyone else to sit in for them from the Big Network?Are Dan Shulman, Curt Schilling and Aaron Boone (who was substituting for John Kruk) better, more informed voices? Not at all -- and certainly not when handicapped by calling the game from the distant stands. They were so far from the action that they clearly had to rely heavily on their monitors. And they did nothing to make their unusual placement worth the effort. They called the game as they would from the booth, but they could not see the field as they normally would have.After the Nationals' Anthony Rendon slammed a first-inning pitch from Mets starter Noah Syndergaard off the left-center-field wall -- not far from ESPN's version of Uecker seats -- it was called a double until Washington Manager Matt Williams asked for a challenge that he eventually won. It was only then, from such a poor announcing position, that the ESPN crew recognized that it might have been a home run. But Schilling was more interested in teasing Shulman for not reaching for the ball, and Shulman asked: ""Was this over the line? I was too busy ducking for cover to see.""During the eighth inning, the trio in the stands and the reporter Buster Olney discussed, ad nauseam, Syndergaard's improving ability to get first-pitch strikes. Their discussion continued as Rendon shot a ground-rule double down the right-field line. It continued without anyone's saying anything about Rendon's hit. Was it a ground-rule double? No one said. The live shot was not telling (and disappeared quickly), and no replay was shown. The discussion continued as ESPN cut to its announcers and then to Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy conferring on the mound with Syndergaard.Shulman finally acknowledged the vision of a base runner at second when he saw a two-shot of Syndergaard in the foreground and Rendon in the background.More than three minutes had passed from Rendon's hit to the end of the half-inning, and nothing had been said of how he ended up there.This is not a screed against experimenting with the traditional model of two or three announcers in a booth above home plate. But if you want to detour from tried-and-true game-calling, then offer something different or radical, not just three guys trying to call a game as they would in a booth, but from lousy seats. The next time ESPN ventures into the grandstand, it should put one analyst there to interact with fans but not require him to do what he would do in a booth. Let him have fun; let him capitalize on the unusual surroundings.Or let Schilling sit with a scout behind home plate and let them talk about pitching. Just don't move everyone in the booth to the Land of Far, Far Away and expect a fully informed broadcast.Giddy Mets fans will watch their renascent team play wherever the announcers are. After 348,877 viewers in the New York market watched Friday night's victory and 322,945 tuned in Saturday night for the 3-2 win -- combining to be SNY's highest-rated Mets series in three years -- an even larger local audience of 474,00 households saw the ESPN telecast.So far this season, the Mets' average viewership on SNY is up 29 percent, to 206,607.And now, let us return to Gary, Keith and Ron, in a booth, it is hoped.AuthorAffiliation RICHARD SANDOMIR sandor@nytimes.comPhotograph Michael Conforto Hitting a Three-Run Home Run Monday for the Mets, Who Were Coming Off a Rousing Sweep of the Nationals.

The Village Girl Who Grew Up to Be a Billionaire:   [Money and Business/Financial Desk ],,"Zhou Qunfei is the world's richest self-made woman. Ms. Zhou, the founder of Lens Technology, owns a $27 million estate in Hong Kong. She jets off to Silicon Valley and Seoul, South Korea, to court executives at Apple and Samsung, her two biggest customers. She has played host to President Xi Jinping of China, when he visited her company's headquarters.But she seems most at home pacing the floor of her state-of-the-art factory, tinkering.She'll dip her hands into a tray of water, to determine whether the temperature is just right. She can explain the intricacies of heating glass in a potassium ion bath. When she passes a grinding machine, she is apt to ask technicians to step aside so she can take their place for a while.Ms. Zhou knows the drill. For years, she labored in a factory, the best job she could get having grown up in an impoverished village in central China.""She'll sometimes sit down and work as an operator to see if there's anything wrong with the process,"" said James Zhao, a general manager at Lens Technology. ""That will put me in a very awkward position. If there's a problem, she'd say, 'Why didn't you see that?' ""Ms. Zhou has honed her hands-on knowledge into a world-class, multibillion-dollar operation, one at the vanguard of China's push into high-end manufacturing. Lens Technology is now one of the leading suppliers of the so-called cover glass used in laptops, tablets and mobile devices, including the Apple iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy. This year, her factories are expected to churn out more than a billion glass screens, each refined to a fraction of a millimeter.""This is an industry that requires highly sophisticated technology,"" says Stone Wu, an analyst at IHS Technology, the research firm. ""If you have a ruler, check out how thin 0.5 millimeters is, and you'll understand how hard it is to manufacture something that thin.""In creating a global supplier, Ms. Zhou, 44, has come to define a new class of female entrepreneurs in China who have built their wealth from nearly nothing -- a rarity in the world of business. In Japan, there is not a single self-made female billionaire, according to Forbes. In the United States and Europe, most women who are billionaires secured their wealth through inheritance.No country has more self-made female billionaires than China. The Communist Party, under Mao Zedong, promoted gender equality, allowing women to flourish after capitalism started to take hold, according to Huang Yasheng, an expert in China's entrepreneurial class and a professor of international management at M.I.T. And in a country with few established players, entrepreneurs like Ms. Zhou were able to quickly make their mark when they entered business in the 1990s as China's economic engine was revving up.Ms. Zhou's stake in Lens Technology, which went public this year, is worth $7.2 billion. That puts her fortune on par with the media tycoon John C. Malone and Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay.Ms. Zhou isn't a celebrity chieftain, like Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba. Few in China had even heard her name before her company's public offering this year. She rarely grants interviews or makes public appearances.An elegant woman with a cherubic face, owlish glasses and a preference for Christian Dior suits, Ms. Zhou is fastidious and demanding -- ""Sit up straight!"" she commands of a general manager during a meeting. Yet she exudes charm and humility, a quiet recognition that things could have easily turned out differently.""In the village where I grew up, a lot of girls didn't have a choice of whether to go to middle school. They would get engaged or married and spend their entire life in that village,"" she said in an interview at her office, where there was a wooden statue of Mao and a 27-inch desktop Mac. ""I chose to be in business, and I don't regret it.""Leaning Toward the ObsessiveThe youngest of three children, Ms. Zhou was born in a tiny village in the Hunan Province of central China, a farming community about two hours south of Changsha, the provincial capital. Her mother died when she was 5. Her father, a skilled craftsman, later lost a finger and most of his eyesight in an industrial accident.At home, she helped her family raise pigs and ducks for food and additional money. At school, she excelled.""She was a hard-working and talented student,"" Zhong Xiaobai, her former middle-school teacher, says. ""I once read her essay, 'My Mother,' aloud in class. It was so moving it brought everyone to tears.""Despite her academic focus, Ms. Zhou dropped out of school at 16 and traveled south to Guangdong province to live with her uncle's family and search for better work. While she dreamed of becoming a fashion designer, she eventually landed a job on a factory floor in the city of Shenzhen, making watch lenses for about $1 a day.The conditions, she said, were harsh. ""I worked from 8 a.m. to 12 a.m., and sometimes until 2 a.m.,"" Ms. Zhou recalled. ""There were no shifts, just a few dozen people, and we all polished glass. I didn't enjoy it.""After three months, she decided to quit and wrote a letter of resignation to her boss. In it, she complained about the hours and boredom. Even so, she expressed her gratitude for the job, saying she wanted to learn more.The letter impressed the factory chief, who told her the plant was about to adopt new processes. He asked her to stay, offering her a promotion. It was the first of several over the next three years.In 1993, Ms. Zhou, then 22, decided to set out on her own. With $3,000 in savings, she and several relatives started their own workshop next door. They lured customers with the promise of even higher-quality watch lenses.At the new company, Ms. Zhou did it all. She repaired and designed factory machinery. She taught herself complex screen-printing processes and difficult techniques that allowed her to improve prints for curved glass.""In the Hunan language, we call women like her 'ba de man,' which means a person who dares to do what others are afraid to do,"" said her cousin Zhou Xinyi, who helped her open the workshop and now serves on the Lens board.Along the way, Zhou Qunfei married her former factory boss, had a child and divorced. She later married a longtime factory colleague, who serves on the Lens board, and had a second child.Her work habits lean toward the obsessive. Her company's headquarters is at one of her manufacturing plants in Changsha. In her spacious office, a door behind her desk opens into a small apartment, ensuring she can roam the factory floor day or night.Propelled to DominanceIt was the mobile phone that made Ms. Zhou a billionaire.In 2003, she was still making glass for watches when she received an unexpected phone call from executives at Motorola. They asked if she was willing to help them develop a glass screen for their new device, the Razr V3.At the time, the display screens on most mobile phones were made of plastic. Motorola wanted a glass display that would be more resistant to scratches and provide sharper images for text messages, photos and multimedia.""I got this call, and they said, 'Just answer yes or no, and if the answer's yes, we'll help you set up the process,' "" Ms. Zhou recalled. ""I said yes.""Soon after, orders started rolling in from other mobile-phone makers like HTC, Nokia and Samsung. Then, in 2007, Apple entered the market with the iPhone, which had a keyboard-enabled glass touch screen that rewrote the rules of the game for mobile devices. Apple picked Lens as its supplier, propelling Ms. Zhou's company into a dominant position in China.After that, Ms. Zhou invested heavily in new facilities and hired skilled technicians. More than once, colleagues say, she put up her apartment as a guarantee for a new bank loan. Within five years, she had manufacturing plants under construction in three cities.""She's a passionate entrepreneur, and she's very hands-on,"" says James Hollis, an executive at Corning, which has a partnership with Lens Technology. ""I've watched her company grow, and her develop a strong team. Now there are over 100 competitors in this space, but Lens is a Tier 1 player.""Lens operates round the clock, with 75,000 workers spread across three main manufacturing facilities that occupy about 800 acres in the Changsha region. Each day, the company receives bulk shipments of glass from global manufacturers like Corning in the United States and Asahi Glass in Japan.The glass is cut, ground down to size, bored and polished to give each plate a transparent finish. Then the plates are strengthened in a potassium ion bath, painted and cured. Finally, they are cleaned and coated with anti-smudge and anti-reflection films.Ms. Zhou designs and choreographs nearly every step of the process, a detailed-oriented approach she traces to her childhood. ""My father had lost his eyesight, so if we placed something somewhere, it had to be in the right spot, exactly, or something could go wrong,"" she said. ""That's the attention to detail I demand at the workplace.""Lens has not experienced the kinds of labor troubles that have clouded other contract manufacturers like Foxconn. But current and former workers say the job is challenging. Much of the work is done by young women who inspect glass at different angles, trying to detect flaws.""As a quality inspector, I had to stare at those products all day long, so this is a tiring job,"" said Gao Zhimei, who recently left Lens Technology. ""But I should say that working in manufacturing is always tiring and working at Lens is not more tiring than working in other factories.""Expanding a Customer BaseLens Technology went public in March, as the Chinese stock market was booming. With the recent market collapse, the company has lost 45 percent in value, but it is still worth about $8 billion.Last year, the company notched revenue of about $2.4 billion. Profit rose 40 percent in the first quarter. But Lens gets nearly 75 percent of its revenue from Apple and Samsung, making the company reliant on just two customers. In May, at the first shareholders' meeting since the company went public, an investor pressed Lens about how it planned to maintain an edge in a hypercompetitive market that thrives on innovation.Several executives tried to answer the question. Then Ms. Zhou spoke up, saying she was prepared to diversify the company's business with production facilities geared toward higher-end glass, as well as sapphire and ceramic.After the meeting adjourned, investors piled into a bus and rode with Ms. Zhou to the Lens campus, less than a mile away. Ms. Zhou had sat quietly through much of the shareholders' meeting, but on the tour of the factory, she came alive. The shareholders hung on every word.",0.0
"Jets Drop Ball, and Watt Drops Jets:   [Sports Desk ]",,"HOUSTON -- The Jets tried holding on to their playoff aspirations Sunday, but they dropped them, like the deep balls botched by their rookie receiver. The Jets tried sustaining those aspirations, but they were depleted by every sack they allowed, every interception they threw, every dose of gadgetry that stunned them into mediocrity.No matter how Coach Todd Bowles chooses to spin their plight, the Jets are reeling, losers of four of their last five games. The ramifications of this latest flop, a 24-17 loss to the Houston Texans at NRG Stadium, radiated throughout the premises afterward.In the back of the locker room, the stall of the star cornerback Darrelle Revis, who was torched for a 61-yard touchdown in his worst game since rejoining the team, sat empty. He was being treated for symptoms of a concussion that could jeopardize his availability for next week's game against the Miami Dolphins.Toward the front, the rookie Devin Smith -- who butchered one long pass over the middle and then mangled what would have been a 46-yard touchdown -- sat facing his locker, head down, nodding along to the encouraging words of the receivers coach Karl Dorrell.In the interview room, Bowles's nostrils flared, and his eyes raged as he demolished his team for its failure to perform in critical situations. Told that he had expressed the same displeasure before, Bowles said: ""I'm not repeating myself. I'm just stating the obvious.""No longer are the Jets in command of a wild-card berth in the A.F.C., as they were a month ago. No longer are the Jets a prime contender for a postseason spot, as they were two weeks ago. No longer do the Jets have solid positioning on the periphery of the race, as they did 10 days ago.Through 10 games, the Jets are 5-5, an average record for an average team. Because of the ordinary A.F.C., the Jets remain in the hunt, resembling business travelers with meager airline status. They are sort of special, but not really.They believe that they are better than average, which could be true. Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, for one, noted his frustration with losing to teams ""that we feel like we're better than,"" though it was not immediately clear how long that list was. It is also just as possible that the Jets are worse than average.A full deconstruction of Sunday's mess will take place Monday, when Bowles and his staff will evaluate why the Texans looked like the fresher and more prepared team, despite having four fewer days of rest.And why the Jets failed to make the necessary adjustments to counter a backup quarterback, T. J. Yates, and the trickery deployed to minimize his limitations.And why Houston's two best players -- receiver DeAndre Hopkins, who burned Revis on that long score, and defensive end J. J. Watt, who had two sacks, five quarterback hits and five tackles for loss -- made a mockery of the notion that the Jets could contain them.In the aftermath, Bowles will also examine whether Fitzpatrick remains his best option at quarterback after interceptions on the Jets' last two drives stalled any hopes of a comeback. The issue was left unresolved Sunday.That Bowles did not immediately say Fitzpatrick would start next week suggests that Bowles is at least considering a change, even if he is unlikely to make one.""I'm still committed to Ryan,"" Bowles said. ""I just don't think he played very well, just like a lot of other people on both sides of the ball.""With the exception of long snapper Tanner Purdum and Randy Bullock, who made all three of his kicks, Bowles could have been speaking about anyone.With Houston starter Brian Hoyer sidelined, the Jets' defense buckled against Yates, who had thrown only 15 passes the last two seasons and had not started a game since January 2012. The Jets had professed not to care about Yates's inexperience, saying that they were preparing not for him but for Houston's scheme, which nonetheless managed to surprise them.The Texans unleashed the Wildcat formation, gaining two first downs on a 16-play drive that led to a field goal, and then a double pass from Yates to Cecil Shorts, who threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to an open Alfred Blue that snapped a 10-10 tie midway through the third quarter.Asked if he had seen that play before, cornerback Buster Skrine said, ""Never.""Asked if the Jets were caught off guard, Shorts said, ""They had no clue what to do.""There were other indictments, too, like Watt's persistent abuse of right tackle Breno Giacomini and anyone else the Jets tried to block him with, and Hopkins's unfolding a beach chair on Revis Island.""I play football,"" Hopkins said. ""Went out there and played my game. Nothing special.""That is also an apt description of the Jets' suddenly one-dimensional offense, which averaged 3.3 yards rushing on 21 carries and tends to rely too much on receiver Brandon Marshall, who short-armed one pass and was unable to corral a deep ball on the Jets' second series.The offensive coordinator Chan Gailey spoke last week of the importance of another player emerging. Given a chance, with the Jets trailing by 24-10 late in the third quarter, Smith struggled to track a perfect pass from Fitzpatrick that landed in his hands.""Our rookies got to stop being rookies,"" Bowles said, alluding to Smith, who against Buffalo fumbled a kickoff that was returned for a touchdown. ""They need to grow up. They get paid like everybody else. They got to start acting like they're not in college no more.""Those with far more experience contributed to the misery. In his return to Houston, where he spent 15 years working in the front office, Jets General Manager Mike Maccagnan watched the offense he assembled amass all of 57 first-half yards and, for a second consecutive game, score 3 first-half points.The Jets lacked precision. And energy. And yards. And points. And first downs. And third-down conversions.Asked to explain his unit's lethargic starts, Marshall suppressed his candor, pausing for 10 seconds before answering.""We just got to make plays,"" Marshall said.He paused for 13 more seconds before basically repeating himself, and then offered an assessment rarely spoken of teams that fashion themselves as contenders.""We're not playing good football,"" Marshall said, ""and that's everybody in the locker room.""EXTRA POINTSCenter Nick Mangold left after the Jets' second series with a deep gash to his right hand between his pinkie and ring finger. It required stitches, and he did not return. He said he was optimistic that he could play next week against Miami. ...Both of the Jets' 2013 first-round draft picks were inactive Sunday. Defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson was sidelined by a balky hamstring, while cornerback Dee Milliner, sick last week but listed on the injury report as probable, was a healthy scratch.Photograph Jets Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, Who Played with an Injured Left Hand, Being Tackled by Houston Defensive End J.

Going Online to Plead for Help:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"""I can't even believe I'm writing this, or asking for this, but this is the reality.""This appeal on GoFundMe appeared on Monday, like thousands of others showing up each day on that site and others like it. The Nowakowski siblings of Milwaukee were asking for $25,000 to help their parents, as their father struggled to pay for the care of their mother, who has dementia and mobility challenges and recently moved into an assisted-living home.Their biggest goal is a wheelchair-accessible van to restore some sense of normalcy to their parents' lives, allowing them to continue going to the farmers' market and to see their favorite band, the Whiskey Belles.The family's situation is not life or death, or even as severe as imminent eviction or lack of electricity, like some of the requests on older sites like Modest Needs.But it's not in the same category as art projects or entrepreneurial ventures either, such as those you'd see on Kickstarter. Charitable fund-raising campaigns or requests for race-for-the-cure pledges are a different type of plea, too.Instead, the increasing number of personal appeals like this represent a muddled middle, where people who do not have enough ask for help to make life better. The requests lie somewhere along the murky wants-versus-needs continuum, but it would be hard to agree on exactly where they sit.We are not used to this, the sheer nakedness of people putting a number to their problems and disclosing it to the world. But more financial transparency is almost always better than less, and the Internet provides an emboldening platform. Then, it is up to everyone to push the button to give money or not.Plenty of people are making the requests. GoFundMe plays host to about 3,300 new personal campaigns (as the company refers to them) each day. The most common category is medical expenses, followed by memorials and funerals, general emergencies and education costs.While not all requests are successful, people can keep whatever they take in, even if they don't hit their goal (and also if they exceed it). As of September, the askers had raised over $1 billion in the previous 12 months, though the for-profit company does take about 8 percent in fees for customers in North America. The money it transfers for personal campaigns is a gift, so the givers get no tax deduction, and the company does not guarantee that people are telling the truth. It urges people to give money only to those they ""know and trust.""So who are these people who are giving and taking?There is something appealing about the idea that this is ""really Midwestern,"" as a writer for the personal finance website The Billfold suggested earlier this year. Indeed, to the money-talk-isn't-polite crowd, crowdfunding is often something to sneer at. But those of us reared far from moneyed coastal communities keep right on with our barn raisings, virtual or otherwise.It apparently isn't always easy to figure out just how bold to encourage people to be, though. One service called Present Value began as a registry where engaged couples could just ask directly for cash in lieu of upgraded kitchen appliances and more traditional wedding gifts. The platform is still there, but the company has shifted its focus toward helping users figure out how to put the money they receive to work, whether in stocks or college savings.Those gift requests were strictly wants. Other kinds of requests that are further down the necessity continuum began appearing on sites like Indiegogo a few years ago and complicated the proceedings. Yet it didn't make much sense for users to see requests for help with something like fertility treatments next to fledgling art projects in need of money.Plus, the branding was all wrong. ""Indie"" suggests filmmaking, and ""go go"" suggests movement and dancing, not eggs and sperm that are having trouble meeting -- let alone funeral expenses or missed college tuition payments. Indiegogo has now moved the more acute financial requests to Generosity.com.One advantage that all such sites offer is that you don't have to look anyone in the eye when making your request. You can ask everyone without having to ask anyone in particular. It's also less aggressive than making a one-on-one plea.Or perhaps it's just passive-aggressive. There is always the possibility that the person who is asking is making a list and checking it twice (and then 50 times more) to see who has pitched in and who has not. But Dana Nowakowski, who made the van appeal with her brother, Luke, said that she was not doing that at all.""I dreaded doing it,"" she said. ""I've been writing it in my head every morning for the last couple of weeks, in the shower, getting ready, just dreading writing this story.""So why do it? ""There is an element of desperation,"" she said. Hers, she explained, is a family that does not ask for things. They work for what they get and they buy what they can afford and that's just how it has always been. They do not expect things or feel entitled to them.But her parents, she said, had done so much for so many people for so long, baking cookies and making casseroles and giving rides and handing out gift cards. Her father is a retired teacher. And few people knew just how desperate things had become in recent weeks, when her mother moved into the dementia care home and the costs became clear. ""They were the first ones there for friends and family,"" she said. ""So I guess I kind of thought, 'Hey, it's their turn. It's time for everyone to return the favor.""'In an odd coincidence, Ms. Nowakowski works as a writer for an ad agency. So was this just another ""campaign,"" as GoFundMe puts it, except one where she had to sell her family's plight? ""Selling implies exaggerating, calculating, sometimes even manipulating the truth,"" she said. ""The sad truth is I didn't have to sell anything. This crappy situation sells itself.""Even introducing the idea of commerce here, however, ought to make us all deeply uncomfortable. Is this what we've been reduced to, weighing pitches for charity from people we know and pitting them against strangers online, or the needy whom more traditional charities serve?What was I to make of my own cynicism as I found myself deep in the weeds on these sites this week, evaluating a newly fatherless child. Should I support her, given that I was pretty sure that a seven-figure settlement would be coming her way because of the circumstances of her father's accidental death?So here's another way to think about these sites. They don't replace traditional charity, or obviate the obligation to vote and lobby for policy changes that could reduce many of the needs they serve. But they can allow you to honor your own family's history of having been helped by letting you pay back those who have supported you in the past, or toss the rope to others who are in circumstances similar to ones that you once found yourself in.That, at least, is how family, friends and fans of the Nowakowskis seem to be seeing it. As of this writing, they've raised $20,830, more than 80 percent of their goal. And Ms. Nowakowski said she didn't feel a shred of regret.""The support we're getting from this is just as important to me as the money,"" she said. ""You can really feel the love, the warmth, the fact that people have your back. And that's what we needed the most.""Make the most of your money.

Risks: Beware Blood Pressure Shifts:   [Science Desk ],,"Large variations in blood pressure readings from one doctor's appointment to another are associated with cardiovascular disease and death, a new study has found.Researchers used data from more than 25,000 people participating in a study of medicines for hypertension. They took seven blood pressure readings during months six to 28 of the study and then followed the patients for an average of 2.8 more years. The study is in Annals of Internal Medicine.Compared with those in the lowest one-fifth for variability in systolic blood pressure readings, those in the highest one-fifth were 30 percent more likely to die of cardiovascular disease or have a nonfatal heart attack, 46 percent more likely to have a stroke, 25 percent more likely to have heart failure, and 58 percent more likely to die from any cause. The researchers controlled for age, sex, race, smoking, diabetes and other factors.While the study found an association, it does not prove cause and effect.""We usually use average blood pressure as a measure, because reducing that has led to reduced risk. The fluctuations get dismissed,"" said the lead author, Paul Muntner, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. ""But variability in blood pressure appears to be a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and it may be an important thing for doctors to look at.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Graph Graphic",0.0
"Nagasaki, the Forgotten City:   Commentary",,"ON Aug. 9, 1945, the United States dropped a nuclear bomb on Nagasaki, situated on a long, narrow bay on Japan's southernmost main island, Kyushu.From the beginning, this attack was different than the atomic bombing of Hiroshima three days earlier, yet the experiences of the two cities have been fused in memory, to the point that we use the term ""the bomb"" to refer to both events. The result has been to consign Nagasaki to the edge of oblivion.Many Americans believe their government's official narrative: that the two bombs, dropped in close succession, led to Japan's surrender. But it is now well known that the surrender was prompted at least as much by the Soviet Union's decision to join the Allies in the war against Japan. Just 11 hours before the Nagasaki bombing, 1.5 million Soviet troops crossed into the Japanese puppet state in Manchuria, in northern China, and attacked the depleted Japanese Army there on three fronts.The United States expected the Soviet action, but the delivery of the second atomic bomb was not dependent on the timing of the Soviet invasion, Tokyo's response, or even a specific order from President Harry S. Truman. His sole directive had been to use nuclear weapons on Japan ""as made ready"" -- and on Aug. 8, the second bomb's assembly was complete.The next morning -- 30 minutes before the Nagasaki bombing -- Japan's Supreme War Council convened to try yet again to find agreement on surrender terms. Stalin's declaration of war had ended any last hope of Soviet help in attaining more favorable surrender terms.Council members pressing for immediate surrender were gravely concerned about lack of food and supplies for Japanese troops, the dire domestic situation and the Hiroshima bombing. Militarists were willing to fight to the death for the guaranteed preservation of Emperor Hirohito's postwar sovereignty. When news of the Nagasaki attack arrived, the deliberations continued without further mention of it. That night, Hirohito broke the deadlock and sanctioned surrender.In the United States, Nagasaki was overshadowed by Hiroshima from the very start. While the first atomic bombing gained headlines, the Nagasaki bombing shared the day's news with the Soviet advance. In a radio address on the evening of Aug. 9, Truman outlined a political and economic framework for postwar Europe. He referred to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima only once, but did not mention Nagasaki.About 74,000 people in Nagasaki died instantaneously or within five months of the bombing. Only 150 were military personnel. Another 75,000 people were injured, and these numbers do not count those who fell ill and died from radiation-related conditions in the decades to come.Initially, purple spots appeared on their bodies, their hair fell out, and they developed high fevers, infections, and swollen and bleeding gums. Later, cancer rates surged. The survivors, known as hibakusha, lived in constant fear of illness and death.The United States suppressed this part of the story. In the fall of 1945, high-level American officials rebutted news reports of deaths from radiation exposure. For years to come, the occupation authorities censored news accounts, photographs, scientific research and personal testimonies about the attacks.To counter growing criticism of the bombings, American leaders established a narrative that the bombings had ended the war and saved up to 1 million American lives by preventing an invasion of Japan. (These postwar casualty estimates were far higher than pre-bomb calculations.) Most Americans accepted this narrative.Few Americans know much about Nagasaki. A center for trade in the late 1500s, it was the vanguard for the nation's early modernization and the hub for Catholic missionary outreach. When Japan officially banned Christianity in 1614, then closed its borders to outside contact from the 1630s to the late 1850s, Nagasaki alone was allowed to continue limited international trade, providing the city's growing population exposure to Asian and European arts, science and literature. Nagasaki continued to thrive after Japan re-established diplomatic relations with the West, becoming the third largest shipbuilding city in the world. Christians who had long hidden their faith re-emerged, and Nagasaki became the home of the largest Catholic church in East Asia. An estimated 10,000 Catholics died in the 1945 bombing.Sumiteru Taniguchi, 16, was delivering mail on his bicycle in the northwestern corner of the city when the force of the explosion hurled him into the air. Even from a mile away, the searing heat instantly disintegrated his cotton shirt and burned the skin off his entire back and one arm. Three months later, he was finally taken to a naval hospital 22 miles north of the city, where he lay on his stomach for more than three years, begging the nurses to let him die. Later, after he had learned to sit, stand and ultimately walk again, Mr. Taniguchi seethed in anger at what he believed was the unnecessary nuclear devastation of his city and its people.Over the past 70 years, Mr. Taniguchi and tens of thousands of other hibakusha have navigated punishing injuries, late-onset radiation-related illnesses, and haunting fears that they would pass on genetic disorders to their children and grandchildren. Many never speak about their atomic bomb experiences, even within their families. In a remarkable act of resilience, however, Mr. Taniguchi and a small number of hibakusha made the very personal choice, some as early as the mid-1950s, to speak publicly about their survival.They do not tell their stories to promote Japan's victimization, or to minimize the attack on Pearl Harbor, or the suffering and deaths of Asian civilians and Allied military personnel at the hands of brutal Japanese soldiers. Rather, they speak to eliminate ignorance about the realities of nuclear war and to eradicate nuclear stockpiles across the globe.The official narrative remains the dominant opinion of most Americans. In that story, Nagasaki fades in memory; we should not let it. Our time to understand the survivors' experience of nuclear war is running out. Only they can tell us what it was like, and their lives are coming to an end.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.AuthorAffiliation SUSAN SOUTHARD Susan Southard is the author of ""Nagasaki: Life After Nuclear War.""",0.0

U.S. Is Seeking Felony Pleas by Big Banks:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"The Justice Department is pushing some of the biggest banks on Wall Street -- including, for the first time in decades, American institutions -- to plead guilty to criminal charges that they manipulated the prices of foreign currencies.In the final stages of a long-running investigation into corruption in the world's largest financial market, federal prosecutors have recently informed Barclays, JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Citigroup that they must enter guilty pleas to settle the cases, according to lawyers briefed on the matter. The pleas would be likely to carry a symbolic stigma, if limited actual fallout, in handing felony convictions to some of the world's biggest banks.Yet even as those cases head toward negotiations over potential plea deals -- a development that has not been previously reported -- additional currency misconduct has surfaced in a New York state investigation, confidential documents show. The documents, excerpts from online chat rooms reviewed by The New York Times, suggest that banks designed electronic trading platforms that effectively drove up the price of currencies sold to clients. In the chats, replete with expletives and industry jargon, employees described and even joked about how the platform would cancel trades that ceased to be profitable for the bank.New York's financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, initially focused on platforms at Barclays and Deutsche Bank, but he has since subpoenaed four other banks: Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas and Société Générale. None of the banks have been accused of wrongdoing, and they are cooperating with the investigation.The Justice Department's plea deals, if ultimately reached, would not cover any wrongdoing that surfaces from Mr. Lawsky's investigation. Negotiations with the Justice Department are likely to center on which entity will plead guilty: the bank's parent company, or a subsidiary that housed the misconduct. The banks, which have argued that the wrongdoing was isolated to midlevel employees, prefer that a subsidiary take the fall.The currency case is expected to ensnare traders but not top-level executives. As a result, it may add fuel to the criticism that prosecutors have not charged one top executive on Wall Street. Without charges to mollify the public anger over the financial crisis, the recent cases have presented little more than a pyrrhic victory for the Justice Department.Still, the developments underscore a broader reality on Wall Street of late: One investigation begets another. With each settlement for money laundering, manipulating interest rates or aiding tax fraud, new cases crop up, often unearthed in the course of the previous investigation.The currency investigation would expand on those cases, which produced guilty pleas only from foreign banks. In pursuing cases last year against those foreign banks, Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas, prosecutors confronted the popular belief that banks had grown so important to the economy that they could not be charged.After those deals set off few if any practical repercussions -- the stocks of the banks actually jumped following the news -- prosecutors in the currency case are now demanding pleas from JPMorgan and Citigroup, the lawyers said, in addition to Barclays of Britain and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The banks, before entering a guilty plea for any entity, will likely seek assurances that the charges would not prompt a revocation of their licenses or cost them any major business lines. If the banks resist, the Justice Department has warned that an indictment and ultimately a trial await.For the Justice Department, the currency case represents a last opportunity to shape the white-collar legacy of Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who has announced plans to step down once his replacement is confirmed. Blamed for the lack of criminal cases against Wall Street executives, Mr. Holder has emphasized that ""no financial institution, at home or abroad, is too powerful to be held accountable for wrongdoing.""A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment, as did all of the banks under investigation. The lawyers briefed on the investigations spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private settlement talks.The Justice Department and the banks, the lawyers said, will most likely take weeks or even months to negotiate a settlement. The deals could be announced in close succession, if not on the same day.The currency investigation began in earnest two years ago with the suspicion that traders across Wall Street manipulated the foreign exchange market, pushing prices up and down to suit their own holdings. Although foreign exchange is an enormous global market, with more than $5 trillion changing hands each day, it is one of the least regulated.Banks eventually fired dozens of traders implicated in the scheme. Authorities around the globe scrambled to stake a claim to the investigation.In November, six banks sought to close the first chapter of the case, agreeing to pay a combined $4.25 billion to settle with financial regulators in Washington and Britain. The settlement, which included JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, the Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and HSBC, exposed the way banks colluded to manipulate currencies through emails and online chat rooms.""He's sat back in his chair... feet on desk... announcing to desk... that's why I got the bonus pool,"" one trader remarked to a rival after they colluded on a rate, earning, according to regulators, a profit of $513,000 on the trade. Traders who collaborated to rig the market called themselves ""the Players"" and ""the Three Musketeers.""On the eve of the settlement, Barclays withdrew from the deal over concerns that it would not completely resolve its liabilities. The bank had hoped that Mr. Lawsky's agency would join the pact.Now that the Justice Department has opened settlement talks in the case, demanding guilty pleas for antitrust and fraud charges, Mr. Lawsky is likely to join. Each agency will assess its own fines, the lawyers briefed on the matter said.The Justice Department might also pursue its own investigation into the electronic trading platforms under scrutiny by Mr. Lawsky, the lawyers said. Unlike the original currency investigation, which centered on the behavior of individual traders who altered currency prices to benefit their own positions, Mr. Lawsky's inquiry suspects a more systematic gaming of the currency markets through electronic trading platforms.Over the last decade, many banks began to trade currencies through electronic platforms. Not all such platforms were meant to benefit the banks at the client's expense.But late last year, Mr. Lawsky's agency began to scrutinize the platforms at Deutsche Bank and Barclays, as Bloomberg News reported in December.In the confidential documents reviewed by The Times, it appeared that at least one bank steered certain clients to its platform, which provided the bank a moment to weigh its options in an otherwise high-speed environment.For example, once a client agreed to buy euros at a certain price from a bank, the platform would detect whether the market had suddenly moved in a way that made the trade less profitable for the bank. The platform would then allow the bank to cancel the trade, possibly setting up a chance for the bank to eventually process the trade at a higher price.In the online chat rooms, bank employees mocked their clients for not detecting the setup. And in some cases, when clients inquired about the cancellation, the banks falsely blamed a technical glitch.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Photograph Attorney General Eric Holder, Who Will Soon Step Down, has Been Faulted for a Lack of Cases Against Wall Street Executives.

"Paid Notice: Deaths STATON, ALBERT H.:   [Paid Death Notice ]",,"STATON--Albert H.,Jr. Albert H. Staton, Jr. died peacefully Wednesday, July 29th at home in Coral Gables, FL, age 94. He had recently celebrated 72 years of marriage to his beloved wife and life partner, Mary Jane Staton (nee Wilson). Born April 1, 1921 in Atlanta, GA, Albert was a successful international businessman who spent much of his working life in Latin America. A brilliant student, he passed the admission exam at Georgia Tech at the age of 15 but was told to wait a year because of his youth. After earning a BS in Chemical Engineering from Georgia Tech in 1941, Albert served in the US Army for four years, first in chemical munitions and later as an intelligence officer with the 77th Infantry Division in the Pacific. He was promoted to the rank of captain on Okinawa, where he received the Bronze Star. In 1951, Albert moved with his family to Colombia to work for Panamerican Investment Company (Panamco) a pioneering softdrink company founded by his father. During his many years with Panamco in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil, Albert was instrumental in building it into one of the largest and best-run Coca-Cola bottling companies outside the US. One of his proudest achievements was the construction of an immense bottling plant in Jundiai, Brazil, that was at the time large enough to supply the entire city of Sao Paolo. Panamco became a public company in 1998 and was acquired by Coca-Cola FEMSA five years later. Albert will be remembered for his optimism, his wit, his multilingualism and his ability to think outside the box. He loved to tell tales of derring-do about his extraordinarily adventurous life. He was passionately interested in world affairs and up to the time of his death perused several newspapers every morning, including The New York Times and the Financial Times. He was also a devoted husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather and friend. He is survived by his wife Mary Jane, also of Atlanta; his son Albert III and daughter Jane; seven grandchildren and three great- grandchildren. His beloved son Stuart died in 2013. 1/3",0.0

"A Mother of Three, Fighting Evictions:   [National Desk ]",,"Gardenia Valerio's two-bedroom apartment in the Soundview section of the Bronx, steps from the Bruckner Expressway, was welcoming and calm.As soon as Ms. Valerio's three children returned from finishing their homework after school at a nearby licensed day care center, a wave of energy washed over the apartment.Ms. Valerio, who was born in the Dominican Republic, speaks some English but feels more comfortable when her children get extra help with their English while doing their homework. Her oldest child, Valeria, 9, proudly shared a student-of-the-month certificate she was awarded.Small hands quickly scooped up toys, including the accessories to a dollhouse that has two tiny cribs, one for a boy and one for a girl. Ms. Valerio's 5-year-old twins, Ashley and Rafael, and Valeria played games on tablets and on Ms. Valerio's smartphone.She made macaroni and cheese as her children settled in for the evening, changing from their school uniforms to more casual clothing.They comfortably made their way from room to room, secure in their surroundings. But it was only five years ago that Ms. Valerio, now 30, and her children did not have a place to call their own. Her relationship with her partner had deteriorated, and they fell behind in the rent. While pregnant with her twins, she was evicted.She went to her mother's house, where she ended up staying for a few years. Later, she found an apartment on the same block as the one she had been evicted from earlier. Ms. Valerio got work as a home health aide, only to have her hours reduced. In March, facing eviction for a second time, she turned to Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.Catholic Charities negotiated with Ms. Valerio's landlord to cut her rent to $1,175, from $1,400, and paid the back rent she owed, helping her avoid eviction proceedings that were pending in court. She also received help with a Family Eviction Prevention Supplement. With $900 a month from the program, her rent was reduced to $275.Ms. Valerio lived in Puerto Rico before moving to the Bronx, where she dropped out of high school without fully mastering English. She now plans to earn her high school equivalency diploma, improve her English and eventually train to become a medical assistant.Catholic Charities used $379.53 from the Neediest Cases Fund to pay for markers, crayons and backpacks for her children for school.Ms. Valerio said through a Spanish interpreter that she had drawn strength and motivation from her children. They relied on her, she said, so she could not let them down.Their father visits occasionally, but he is not a consistent, dependable figure in the children's lives. She is raising them largely on her own. Ms. Valerio said she was a single parent, but that with her children, she had a family.Photograph Gardenia Valerio, 30, a Native of the Dominican Republic, with Her Children, Valeria, 9, and Twins Ashley and Rafael, 5, in Their Apartment in the Soundview Section of the Bronx.

"Britain: Assange Duty Is Draining Police Coffers, London Chief Says:   [Brief ]",,"London's police chief said Tuesday that the cost of keeping watch on Julian Assange, who is holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy there, was draining resources and must be reviewed.

Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe told LBC Radio that officials were considering ""how we can do that differently in the future, because it's sucking our resources in.""

Rights Group Weighs New Stance on Prostitution:   [Foreign Desk ],,"PARIS -- The question of what should be done about prostitution is as old as the profession itself, but the issue is now front and center again, as a leading human rights group proposes decriminalization, while some countries push toward harsher penalties for those who pay for sex.In France, England and Ireland, lawmakers are considering new measures -- and in the cases of Northern Ireland and Canada, are enforcing new laws -- that impose penalties on clients, using a model adopted in Sweden in 1999.But the effort to crack down on a largely male clientele while sheltering a mostly female work force is taking place just as the human rights group Amnesty International is advocating a new course: decriminalizing all prostitution, both for buyers and sellers.At an international conference next week in Dublin, about 500 Amnesty delegates from more than 80 countries will vote on whether to advocate the elimination of all penalties for prostitution, based on ""evidence that the criminalization of adult sex work can lead to increased human rights violations against sex workers."" The proposal has been denounced by women's groups like the New York-based Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, and celebrities like Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet and Gloria Steinem.""Prostitution has always been considered a domestic matter, and now Amnesty could elevate it to a point of international human rights law,"" said Francis A. Boyle, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois and a former Amnesty board member in the United States. He called that development ""significant.""""But why is the resolution so broad?"" he asked. ""Everything should be organized around that basic principle of protecting the women and girls. We should be protecting human beings, and not sex work.""In June, the French National Assembly voted to support a law to penalize clients of prostitutes. The legislation still faces a vote in the Senate. Last month, Northern Ireland started enforcing new regulations that carry 1,000-pound fines (about $1,500) and prison terms for buyers. Canada instituted similar laws this year. Politicians in England and Ireland are also exploring the so-called Swedish or Nordic model to make paying for sex a crime. Sweden passed its law focusing on buyers 16 years ago, and street prostitution in major Swedish cities has dropped by more than half since 1995. The number of men who said they purchased sex fell, as well, by more than 40 percent in that period, according to a report this year by a Swedish government agency.But Amnesty International, formed in 1961 to bring attention to political prisoners, argues for a different approach in a leaked proposal that has circulated widely. That document contends that sexual desire is a fundamental need and that punishing buyers ""may amount to a violation of the right to privacy and undermine the rights to free expression and health."" The group also cites the benefits for buyers with physical and psychological disabilities who ""feel safe to express their sexuality"" and ""develop a stronger sense of self with their relationships with sex workers.""Amnesty also sides with the argument, made recently by prostitutes in France, that penalizing customers would drive prostitution further underground, making the workers more vulnerable to dangers.The policy vote comes as greater attention is being paid to human trafficking, which often results in forced prostitution, or prostitution as a means of survival. Pope Francis has been outspoken on the issue, calling it a plague on humanity and urging legislation to penalize traffickers and help victims recover.The decriminalization stance has roiled some of Amnesty's two million paying members. Some complain that the draft policy was conceived at Amnesty's headquarters in London. Over the last two years, various versions have been reviewed by the organization's national chapters, and a consensus emerged supporting decriminalization for just the prostitutes, according to minutes of organizational meetings. Amnesty says it has refined its proposal even further, but declined to release the latest version because it is an internal document.The issues raised by the Swedish model are all relevant, said Thomas Schultz-Jagow, a London spokesman for Amnesty, who added that the organization is not discounting them.""We are looking at decriminalization of sex work in a very comprehensive way that goes beyond the Nordic model,"" he said. ""We have looked at the pros and cons of various models."" If a majority approve the decriminalization proposal at next week's conference, it will be shaped into a final form by Amnesty's board. The stance will not have any immediate impact, except it will be the organization's official position as it lobbies on issues in various countries.Nevertheless, women's groups have been sharply critical, arguing that such a position by an organization of Amnesty's stature could sway policy and ultimately result in legalized brothels and owners free to recruit women from poorer countries as prostitutes.""It really undermines the whole concept of human rights to call it the rights of men to buy other human beings for sex,"" said Jessica Neuwirth, a former Amnesty member and the founder of Equality Now, an international women's rights group.She said there are suspicions among the opposition groups that the sex industry helped shape the proposal.Last year, Amnesty's British chapter issued a denial in response to questions about the role of Douglas Fox, who works in the sex industry and claimed credit for pressing for decriminalization through the chapter in Newcastle, England. Amnesty said, though, that he had not been a member for years and had ""zero input"" on its sex work proposal.In an interview, Mr. Fox described himself as a male escort. After joining Amnesty in 2008, he said that he lobbied the group to decriminalize prostitution. He said he quit the organization the following year after it sent him letters asking him to stop promoting himself as a member.""The fact that they are looking to decriminalize is basically what we were proposing,"" he said. ""They are supporting it for all the same reasons."" He added that targeting buyers amounted to ""manufactured moral panic."" He said: ""They think that if you are a foreign sex worker that you are trafficked. We feel they are actually economic migrants.""Niki Adams, a spokeswoman for the English Collective of Prostitutes in London, said that her group has submitted information to Amnesty's chapters in England and Scotland to support decriminalization for all. The organization, which represents women in the sex industry, has also organized a petition drive.""The really crucial element,"" she said, ""is that it defines sex workers as exchanging sex for money as opposed to characterizing them as victims of violence.""But some former prostitutes say they feel betrayed. Rachel Moran, the author of ""Paid For,"" which describes her seven-year experience as a prostitute in Ireland, is involved with a group organizing to oppose Amnesty's proposal.""It's wrong because decriminalizing pimps and johns has been shown to massively inflate the market,"" she said. ""With an inflated market you have more abusers and, as an obvious consequence, more abuse. This has played out in Nevada, Australia, New Zealand, Holland, Germany and everywhere else the sex trade has been legalized.""Photograph Opponents of Prostitution Outside the French National Assembly in Paris in June, When Lawmakers Voted to Penalize People Who Pay for Sex.

Take Your Pick: Fast Talker Or Smooth Talker:   [Review ],,"Judging ""Sneaky Pete,"" which stars Giovanni Ribisi as a con man and recent ex-con hiding out in upstate New York, has a lot to do with context. As an Amazon pilot -- it's one of two, along with ""Casanova,"" going up on Friday -- it looks kind of ordinary, surprisingly like a broadcast network drama. Semi-episodic, slightly procedural, light dusting of dark humor.But set it against the backdrop of the network pilots for this fall, and it takes on a shine. If it were part of that crowd, it would be on everyone's lists of the most promising new shows.""Sneaky Pete"" was written by David Shore, the creator of ""House M.D.,"" and Mr. Ribisi's Marius a.k.a. Pete has a House-like quality: He's an exceptionally skilled observer, which is how he's able to take on the identity of his former cellmate and fool the man's grandparents and cousins, who haven't seen him since he was a child.Marius is in debt to a New York heavy (played by Bryan Cranston of ""Breaking Bad,"" who's also an executive producer) and hopes to avoid him by becoming Pete. He quickly wins the confidence of his new grandparents (Peter Gerety and the ubiquitous Margo Martindale) and an attractive cousin (Marin Ireland), but suffers a comic reversal when he learns that the ""bond"" business his cellmate recalled involves posting bail for suburban criminals rather than trading on Wall Street.Pete's con-man abilities turn out to be well suited to tracking down bail jumpers, though -- one sort of fugitive chasing another -- and by the end of the episode he's joined the family business as well as the family, a point put across not very subtly in some Rockwellian tableaus. Grandma appears to have doubts, however, which are expertly communicated by Ms. Martindale with a few appraising glances.Seth Gordon (""Horrible Bosses,"" ""The Goldbergs""), who directed the pilot, has a taste for the obvious -- whenever Pete notices a detail helpful to his ruse, the camera pulls in on Mr. Ribisi so that we'll notice it too -- but he maintains a brisk pace and a not quite breezy, not quite serious tone appropriate to Mr. Shore's script. And the cast is good, with Mr. Ribisi convincingly charming as the con man with a heart.The second Amazon effort, ""Casanova,"" is the first episodic work by the French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, known for the visual flourish of films like ""City of Lost Children"" and ""Amélie."" On a TV budget he gives us a bright, attractive production with pretty costumes and wigs but nothing very distinctive to look at -- a short early scene on the roof of a Venetian prison is the only moment that makes you wonder what you'll see next.The script by Stu Zicherman (""The Americans,"" ""What About Brian"") imagines Casanova as an 18th-century operative assigned to use his bedroom skills to spy on the French king's mistress, Madame Pompadour (Bojana Novakovic), who's seen as a threat to the state. The opportunities for intrigue and humor in that situation are underutilized; instead we get a proto-feminist Casanova as an excuse to show naked young women being pawed by men, and an enlightened Casanova as an excuse to show the excesses of the ancien régime, including a man being drawn and quartered.Adding to the general blandness and inconsequence is the lead performance by Diego Luna, still best known for ""Y Tu Mamá También."" We're assured that his character is the paramount seducer and adventurer of his time, but Mr. Luna's cautious performance has neither heat nor soul. In the currently crowded ranks of costume dramas, this ""Casanova"" is easy to resist.Photograph Sneaky Pete: Giovanni Ribisi Stars As a Con Man Posing As His Former Prison Cellmate in This Amazon Pilot, Set to Begin Streaming On Friday.; Casanova, a Second Pilot From Amazon That Starts Friday, Features Diego Luna in the Lead Role.

"After Penalty, Fiat Chrysler Profit Falls 3%:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDED. DETROIT -- Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said on Wednesday that profits at its American subsidiary fell 3 percent in the second quarter, primarily because of a record civil penalty against the company for violating federal safety laws.The subsidiary, which encompasses operations of the former Detroit automaker Chrysler, reported net income of $598 million for the quarter compared with $619 million in the same period a year ago.The decrease was attributed to a charge of $90 million for fines agreed to with federal regulators, as well as a $71 million charge to extinguish debt.Last week, Fiat Chrysler signed a consent order with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to resolve the government's wide-ranging investigation of 23 vehicle recalls covering more than 11 million vehicles.The order called for a cash fine of $70 million and a commitment by the company to spend $20 million to satisfy safety performance requirements, including buying back defective vehicles.Fiat Chrysler could be assessed another $15 million in penalties if further safety violations are discovered by an independent monitor, according to the order.Last week, the company's chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said the Chrysler subsidiary had committed to overhaul its safety practices and recall procedures. ""We need to comply 100 percent of the time,"" he said.While its results dropped from a year ago, Chrysler remains the Italian-American automaker's most profitable business unit.Revenue for the subsidiary, which include Chrysler's North American and international operations, rose 11 percent during the quarter, to $22.6 billion.Its worldwide vehicle sales increased 5 percent, to 780,000, in the quarter, from a year earlier. The subsidiary ended the quarter with a United States market share of 12.4 percent, which represented a slight increase from the second quarter in 2014.The subsidiary also improved its cash position during the period, ending the quarter with net cash -- excluding financial liabilities -- of $2.1 billion. At the end of the first quarter, it had about $1.2 billion.",0.0
Luxembourg Tries for an Image Makeover:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"Luxembourg, the country once known as the European ""Death Star"" of financial secrecy, is looking to improve its image.Buffeted by the accusations that it was helping multinational corporations evade billions of dollars in taxes, the country has embarked on a long-term rebranding effort that the government hopes will help the world see it with different eyes.The effort has yet to yield a catchy slogan, but it may not matter. Unless you remember similar exercises that centered on the themes ""The eternal and fascinating Romania,"" or ""I feel SLOVEnia,"" your image of Luxembourg is probably set.This is not the view of a cynical resident or just another analyst. This is the opinion of the man who coined the phrase ""nation branding"" in the 1990s, Simon Anholt.""There is just no evidence that it has ever succeeded in changing the image of a country,"" Mr. Anholt, a policy advisor, said by telephone. ""People recognize it for what it is: state propaganda from a foreign government.""Mr. Anholt said the so-called Luxleaks scandal, in which leaked documents revealing that the government had helped some 300 corporations including Microsoft, Disney and Koch Industries, dodge billions of dollars in taxes, would do more to determine Luxembourg's image than a marketing campaign.""If Luxembourg wants to replace its negative image with a positive image, it would have to do something really good and do it consistently for a long long time,"" he said.Luxembourg, however, believes in branding. The state secretary, Francine Closener, points out that it worked for Switzerland. Because of Swiss marketing, she said, the country is identified with things besides its financial center.""We only started doing this now, because we didn't think it was necessary for a long time,"" she said. ""It wasn't very important to us if we were known in the world and why -- because we were doing fine.""The country has been aware of its tarnished reputation for some time. The previous government, under Jean-Claude Juncker, established a panel made up of the representatives of the monarchy, several ministries and two public-private agencies that promote business to spearhead the branding effort.The panel hired two marketing agencies which conducted surveys and focus groups to determine how residents perceived their country and what it could promote. The project is expected to cost almost one million euros, or just over $1 million, in 2016, when a marketing campaign will begin.The surveys were conducted by the country's statistics agency and the answers submitted showed that Luxembourg was seen as ""reliable, dynamic and open,"" the government announced. These preliminary results will help frame the marketing campaign, it said.But while local products like wine and sausage will be promoted as part of the campaign, it is the financial industry -- as the country's largest -- that remains at the center. This year alone, the group Luxembourg for Finance embarked on so-called financial missions in places like Dubai, Sweden, Canada and China. It also hosted the Luxembourg Renminbi Forum and plans to host an Islamic finance workshop this week.The government has also turned to the public to help improve the country's international standing. Voters were asked in a referendum this year to give voting rights to foreigners, who make up around 46 percent of the country's population. Not only would Luxembourg been the first European Union member to do so, but supporters also saw it as a way to promote the country as a business location. But 80 percent of Luxembourgers voted no.Mario Hirsch, a political scientist, said such marketing campaigns are ""made to divert, to keep people from questioning things.""""To me, nation branding is a smokescreen behind which business can go on as usual,"" said Mr. Hirsch, a visiting senior research fellow at the European Union Institute for Security Studies in Paris, added that that does not mean that ""business as usual is necessarily bad or wrong.""Some believe the country's bad image is a result of an outside smear campaign.""The things we are accused of are things that are practiced by other and larger nations which, of course, don't go at each other but choose to point the finger at us, a small nation, and find support in doing so, because we are doing so well,"" said Emile Haag, author of ""The Rise of Luxembourg from Independence to Success.""A local arts collective has a different view. Richtung22, known for poking fun at national treasures, staged a satirical communication campaign and theater piece about Luxembourg, portraying it as a regressive half-democracy with an industry based on the motto, ""It's not illegal if you do it in Luxembourg.""""How absurd is it to say Luxembourg is open, dynamic and reliable?"" says Lars Schmitz, a member of the collective.Before Luxembourg, it was the former Soviet nations that were best known for rebranding as they entered the global marketplace. Ukraine has made several branding attempts since its independence in 1991. Slogans like ""Ukraine. All about U"" and ""Ukraine. For snowlovers"" painted a portrait of a holiday destination both fun and cozy, far from its Soviet bleakness.After the breakup of the Soviet Union, countries all over Eastern Europe and the Balkans paid marketers for a new start. In addition to the Romania and Slovenia campaigns, there was Albania's ""A New Mediterranean Love,"" the government's effort to attract tourists and foreign investment.Only one year after splitting from Serbia, Kosovo hired BBR Saatchi & Saatchi in 2009 to come up with a brand for the country. The result was ""The Young Europeans,"" a campaign with a video showing young adults collectively building a Kosovo-shaped puzzle on a sunny day. The effort cost the government [euro]5.7 million, a considerable expenditure for the poor Balkan country.Regardless of how Luxembourg's campaign fares, it can be secure in the fact that it already ranks higher than the United States, Japan and Israel on Mr. Anholt's new Good Country Index, which evaluates how each nation takes care of security, health care, climate issues, equality and other issues.""The reality,"" Mr. Anholt said, ""is that it probably deserves a better reputation than it has now acquired for itself.""Photograph Corporations Like Amazon and Ebay Moved Some Operations to Luxembourg, Which Helped Them Avoid Paying Some Taxes.

""Thirty-two points on 12 shots is crazy.""Isaac Copeland scored 11 of Georgetown's first 22 points, helping the Hoyas jump out to a 6-point lead midway through the first.

""Grayson kept us in the ballgame. We could have been blown out of there.""A 3-pointer by Allen, a sophomore guard, with 2 minutes 45 seconds left put Duke up by 8, but Georgetown kept fighting.

"Volume by Volume, Some of Them Purloined, an Investment in Pakistan Continues:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- After his father died, Ahmad Saeed took over the office on the ground floor of the family's storied bookstore here, Saeed Book Bank. Then the elderly men started visiting, seeking to settle old debts.""They all apologized and said they had tried to see my father while he was alive but his office was always too crowded and they were embarrassed,"" Mr. Saeed said.Five times such men arrived, hat in hand, not just to pay their respects to the son and family, but also to say they wanted to pay for books they had shoplifted as children. Mr. Saeed said his father, Saeed Jan Qureshi, who died of heart failure in September, would have been amused: He had always regarded book theft by children as an investment in a future where people still read, and thus become his customers.The man himself became an oracle to those looking for advice on books, taking time to establish a personal connection and to urge favorites on visitors. (That is another thing his son has inherited: He asked a visitor if he had read ""Fallen Leaves,"" the last book by the prolific American historian Will Durant, published in 2014, more than 30 years after his death.)That approach helped Mr. Qureshi make an extraordinary future for Saeed Book Bank, particularly in an era when online sales have been driving independent bookstores out of business, and in a region where unfettered book piracy adds to retailers' travails.With his passion for books, Mr. Qureshi built one of the biggest bookstores in the world -- mostly selling books in English, in a country where that is a second language for most people.Saeed Book Bank has 42,000 square feet of usually busy floor space over three stories, displays 200,000 titles, and stocks more than four million books in its five warehouses -- all, Ahmad Saeed said, ""by the grace of the almighty.""(His visitor had not read ""Fallen Leaves,"" so Mr. Saeed sent one of his 92 employees to fetch a copy. ""It is so good, you must read this book."" Another visitor to the office, an aged doctor named S.H. Naqvi, agreed, having himself read it at their insistence: ""It will touch your heart,"" he said.)Saeed Jan Qureshi came from a family that worked for a feudal landlord named Mir Banda Ali. His estates in southern Sindh Province were so vast that five railway stops reputedly lay within his property lines. His library was similarly scaled, and as a 9-year-old, Saeed was put to work dusting the shelves. One day Mr. Ali found him reading instead of working, and told the boy to get back to work immediately -- but added that he could take a book home every night, so long as he returned it in mint condition.Saeed never got past high school but he was exceedingly well-read, and after school he found a job as a book salesman for a company that sent him to its Peshawar branch. Later, in the 1950s, he opened his own bookshop in Peshawar.During the Cold War years that followed, Pakistan was an outpost in the American rivalry with the Soviet Union, and Peshawar became an important military base, and later a vital C.I.A. base of operations, particularly during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Say what you will about the spooks, they were readers, and Mr. Qureshi built his business around catering to their literary tastes.(Speaking of Afghanistan, Mr. Saeed said: ""Have you read 'The Spinner's Tale,' by Omar Shahid Hamid? No?"" He seemed mildly shocked. Moments later a Pan Macmillan paperback copy of the novel materialized. ""I am sorry, we've sold out of 'Fallen Leaves' -- it's so hard to keep in stock -- but read this,"" Ahmad said. ""A lot of it is set in Afghanistan."")Later the rise of terrorism and fundamentalist Islam made Peshawar, capital of the wild frontier lands of Pakistan, a dangerous place for a bookseller -- especially one who insisted on carrying magazines like Cosmopolitan and Heavy Metal, books by Karen Armstrong on Islam, and even the scientist Richard Dawkins's atheist treatise, ""The God Delusion."" (""You just wouldn't believe how that sells,"" Mr. Saeed said. ""We buy a thousand copies from Random House every year, year after year."")On the other hand, he said, another best-seller is ""The Message of the Qur'an,"" an English translation of the holy book by Muhammad Asad, a European Jewish scholar and diplomat who converted to Islam.Forced to close shop in Peshawar, Mr. Qureshi focused his efforts in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, a place heavily insulated from the country's more extremist elements. Hard times followed as even Islamabad became a ""no families"" posting for diplomats and aid workers, but by then the bookstore was so big that its sheer breadth kept it viable, as plenty of Pakistanis read books in English.""Other Pakistani booksellers laughed at us that we never carried pirated books,"" Mr. Saeed said. ""But only best-sellers get pirated, and we carry everything.""The result is a bookstore of impressive scope, quirky and catholic. ""Islamic Fashion,"" a glossy coffee table book and a best-seller, vies for shelf space with ""Queer Studies.""A thick condolence book for Mr. Qureshi, the third so far, sits on a counter, which sags under the weight of a couple hundred miniature books as well. A few rows away, an entire shelf is given over to Noam Chomsky, 26 titles in all, which may well be more than any bookstore in the world displays for the radical linguist and philosopher.""Honestly, Chomsky sells here,"" Mr. Saeed said.As the eldest son, Mr. Saeed was always destined to take over the business when his father passed away, and to learn the trade he traveled with his father to international book fairs; annually to Frankfurt, thrice yearly to London, twice yearly to Delhi.But not to the United States, the Saeed Book Bank's biggest source of books.""We spend $500,000 annually in America, and I can't get a visa,"" Mr. Saeed said. ""The consular officer said, 'Why can't you just order by email and fax?' They just don't understand about books. You have to go to the warehouses, and see them and feel them -- that's how you buy books.""(""Fallen Leaves"" again: ""When my father was sick, he said, 'Read this book, and you will calm down,""' Mr. Saeed said. ""He was right."" Dr. Naqvi could quote lines from it. ""What if it is for life's sake that we must die?"" Otherwise, ""youth would find no room on the earth."")Mr. Qureshi made sure his children had the education he did not. Ahmad has a master's degree in business administration, with ambitious plans to computerize the store's inventory and build up what is now a clunky and unsophisticated online business. Nonetheless, it sells $1,000 worth of books a day online in a place where credit cards are still a novelty.For his father, books were more than just a business, Mr. Saeed said. One of the penitent former book thieves who dropped in was Suleman Khan, the vice chancellor of Iqra University, in Islamabad.""He came to say that when he was a child, 6 years old or so, he stole an Archie comic book and my father saw him,"" Mr. Saeed said. ""He said he was afraid he was going to get slapped, but my father said: 'This is good that you like books. So every day you can take a book but keep it in mint condition and return it when you're done so I can still sell it.""'And then the vice chancellor said, ""Everything that I am now, I owe to your father.""(Dr. Naqvi, who is getting on in years, had seemed to doze off for a moment but awoke when he heard that story. ""'Fallen Leaves,""' he sighed. ""You have to read that book. Everything is in there."")Photograph Saeed Book Bank in Islamabad, Pakistan, has Become an Institution There, Despite Facing Stiff Online Competition and Existing in a Region Rife with Book Piracy.; Ahmad Saeed, Left, Looking Over a Collection of New Arrivals Before They Reach Store Shelves.

"The Internet Tastes Better With Cat Hair:   [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDED. WHILE it's not true that 15 percent of all Internet traffic is cat-related, as the Friskies cat food company asserted in 2013, it does make a convincing urban legend.""For some reason, cats took off, and then it's this avalanche that just sort of keeps piling up,"" said Jason Eppink, the curator of ""How Cats Took Over the Internet,"" an exhibition that opens on Friday at the Museum of the Moving Image. ""People on the web are more likely to post a cat than another animal, because it sort of perpetuates itself. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.""The exhibition -- which may well be the first mainstream museum installation entirely dedicated to cats online -- is made up mostly of images, videos and GIFs of cats and is meant to be a cultural deconstruction of their enduring popularity. The show takes a high-minded look at anthropomorphism and what it calls the ""aesthetics of cuteness"" as well as a low-brow wallow through cheesy trends -- like the LOLcats who demand cheezburger -- and bad puns, like Caturday, a fad that had people posting cat pictures on Saturdays.The cornerstone of the exhibition is a 20-year timeline that traces the history of cats on the Internet to 1995, when a news group -- a bulletin-board-type online community that was an early form of social media -- coalesced around the members' love of cats. From this began Meowchat, where people swapped role-playing messages posing as their cats, talking in a sort of baby talk. (Predictably, some members of the news group grew revolted and left to form a splinter message board.)The part of the timeline dealing with the present serves as a nostalgia gallery for anyone who has squandered the workday on popular share-mails: There is Cliché Kitty, a frolicking kitten in a field of dandelions that is blithely unaware it is being menaced from behind; Grumpy Cat (of course); and Nyan cat, a cartoon image of a cat named for the Japanese term for ""meow."" There are homages to cat shaming, in which people photograph their cats next to confessional signs (""I puked on my owner's chair""); cat breading, where cat owners place actual slices of bread around their hapless pet's face and take a picture; and -- in a particularly up-to-the-moment cultural reference -- Trump Your Cat, which involves brushing your cat and forming the loose fur into a Donald Trump-style toupee on the cat's head.""Even as far back as 1991, 1995, there was a whole community of cat lovers who found each other online and was doing creative things,"" said Mr. Eppink, 31, who does not own a cat and whose title at the museum is associate curator of digital media. ""They were being performative and creative.""The exhibition reaches back even further, showing what cat video historians believe was the very first example of the genre: a Kinetoscope shot by Thomas Edison in 1894, of two cats in a boxing ring sparring with gloves.Carl Goodman, the museum's executive director, said that the Museum of the Moving Image -- in an arts district next to Kaufman Astoria Studios, a film production hub -- tends to be known for whatever exhibition it is currently showing, which right now is one about the TV show ""Mad Men."" Every year the museum hosts an independent video game festival called IndieCade; it is now installing a permanent gallery dedicated to Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets.Mr. Goodman, who said that he ""happened to own"" a Labradoodle, said he was enthusiastic about the Internet cat exhibition from the start, but acknowledged that there would be doubters. ""Some people are going to sneer at this -- they tend to trivialize cats,"" he said. ""By putting this in a museum, we're not saying that it's art, we're not saying that it's not art -- we're saying it's culturally significant.""The museum is not the first to present cat videos in this context. Since 2012, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis has hosted an annual Internet Cat Video Festival, a sort of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" for cat lovers, a traveling reel of videos that is screened around the country and updated each year. The Walker has lent a hand here, too: One area of the Astoria exhibition, which occupies a pleasant, open space on the second floor of the white-walled and starkly modern museum, is a screening room with bench seating where a half-hour reel of cat videos will be shown in a continuous loop. The reel was compiled by Will Braden, curator of the cat video festival for the Walker. Hard-core cat people will recognize him as the creator of Henri, le Chat Noir, a world-weary house cat who thinks existential thoughts in French.In the reel compiled for this exhibition, ""I tried to showcase the differences in videos that all fall under the banner of cat videos,"" Mr. Braden, who is based in Seattle, said in a telephone interview. ""There are music videos, there are very produced videos, and there are accidental camera phone videos that people just happened to be pointing at their cat. I think that's part of what makes cat videos successful, is that they cover a lot of ground.""Henri -- who in reality is a relative's tuxedo cat, Henry -- appears in a Halloween-themed clip Mr. Braden made called ""L'Haunting,"" in which the cat sneers at the holiday-related paraphernalia around him and observes in French (with English subtitles): ""None of these costumes are truly scary. No one ever dresses as crippling self-doubt.""In related events, the Museum of the Moving Image will hold a ""Cat-vant Garde Film Show"" on Oct. 10, showing avant-garde movies like ""Nightcats"" by Stan Brakhage and ""How to Draw a Cat"" by Pola Chapelle. People can adopt cats at the museum that day and on a second date to be announced.Mr. Eppink, the curator, who once told an interviewer that he was fascinated with the history of the word ""O.K.,"" conducted extensive research on the intersection of cats and the Internet (well beyond Google). From the New Zealand researcher Radha O'Meara, he learned why cat videos are perceived as more appealing than dog videos: Because dogs are pack animals that look artlessly into the camera, whereas cats are hunters that don't care if they are being filmed. ""Cats are more mercurial and liminal,"" Mr. Eppink said.He also crunched numbers with editors from Reddit, YouTube, Tumblr, BuzzFeed and Instagram to suss out what percentage of their traffic was cat-related. Surprise: Other than on Tumblr -- where cats are more popular than dogs -- cats and dogs tend to be tagged, posted and electronically doted on in equal amounts, seldom exceeding .3 percent of a site's traffic.""I take a delight in finding depth in seemingly frivolous subjects,"" Mr. Eppink said.",0.0
"4 Catholic Nonprofits Must Allow Workers Access to Birth Control, Judges Say:   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"Four Roman Catholic nonprofits in New York must allow employees access to contraception, a federal appeals court panel ruled on Friday, reversing a decision by a lower court that allowed the organizations to get around a requirement in the Affordable Care Act.Six other circuit courts around the country deciding on similar arguments involving religious groups have come to similar conclusions, the unanimous three-judge panel noted in its decision, which was written by Judge Rosemary S. Pooler for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York. Other cases are still pending.Under the Affordable Care Act, religious nonprofits that object on religious grounds to providing contraception can opt out by completing a one-page form. Then, a third party, either an insurance company or a health insurance administrator, takes over providing and coordinating payments for the employees' contraceptives.The four New York groups -- a Catholic high school in the Bronx and another on Staten Island, as well as two Catholic health care systems -- argued that the opt-out sheet imposed a ""substantial burden"" on their religious freedom. Either they had to offer ""access to products and services they find objectionable,"" as Judge Pooler summarized it, or they faced high fines.Judge Brian M. Cogan of Federal District Court in Brooklyn upheld that argument in 2013, agreeing that the opt-out provision itself violated the employers' religious freedom. Judge Cogan granted an injunction requiring the to employees pay for their contraceptives.However, Judge Pooler wrote that the opt-out form was, in fact, ""a modicum of paperwork"" that ""relieves, rather than imposes, any substantial burden"" on the plaintiffs' religious freedom.""Eligible organizations are provided the opportunity to freely express their religious objection to such coverage as well as to extricate themselves from its provision,"" she wrote. ""At the same time, insured individuals are not deprived of the benefits of contraceptive coverage.""The health care law requires employers to cover contraceptives for female employees.Religious groups, though, can ""opt out of paying for objectionable medical services without denying these services to employees who may or may not share the religious beliefs of their employer,"" Judge Pooler wrote.The four groups are affiliated with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.As an alternative to the opt-out form, which is sent to the federal Labor Department, religious groups may send a letter to the federal Department of Health and Human Services ""detailing their religious objections in their own words,"" and the government would then notify insurance administrators.If an organization is self-insured, as the four groups are, the administrator may get payments for contraceptives directly from the government, leaving the organization out of the process. Even when the administrator contacts employees who want contraceptives, it has to ""make clear that the eligible organization is neither administering nor funding the contraceptive benefits,"" Judge Pooler wrote.""Viewed objectively, completing a form stating that one has a religious objection is not a substantial burden,"" she wrote.Judge Pooler compared the completion of the form to a conscientious objector's alerting the military to his position. ""There must be some method by which the government can be notified of the objection,"" she wrote. ""Otherwise there is no way that the government can know which organizations it needs to accommodate. Here, the government has provided flexible, largely effortless and essentially cost-free options for notification.""Because the contraceptive coverage was provided under federal law, she wrote, the groups' argument that their completion of the form triggered contraception coverage was incorrect.Brigitte Amiri, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed an amicus brief in the case, said: ""It's a huge victory for all the female employees who work at the organizations. The scorecard is really 7-0 in the Courts of Appeals on this issue.""A spokesman for the archdiocese, Joseph Zwilling, said its lawyers were reviewing the decision. They also represent the religious organizations: Catholic Health Care System, Catholic Health Services of Long Island, Cardinal Spellman High School and Monsignor Farrell High School.",0.0
Turkey Table Trouble:   [Style Desk ],,"My brother and his wife are divorcing. My sister-in-law usually holds Thanksgiving, but this year I am, due to their circumstances. My brother said he will ""give up"" the holiday and we should invite his wife and children. (He is seeing another woman and probably wants to spend the day with her. Meanwhile, my sister-in-law has been texting me about his infidelity. Too weird!) I like my sister-in-law, but she's not family. But if I don't invite her, we won't see the kids. I told my brother they should all come, but he was noncommittal. Ideas?BeatriceNo matter how gnarly a knot I presented to my father as a boy, I could count on his working at it until my shoelaces (or kite strings or yo-yos) were free, at last, for me to knot up all over again. Some people are blessed with patience; others, scissors. Let's try my dad's approach on your Thanksgiving tangle. Dealing with the separate strands makes them easier to handle.First, call your brother on his noble abdication of the holiday. (""I'm guessing you want to spend the day with Sharon. Can't you see her on Black Friday, instead?"") But he may not be keen on sharing close quarters with his estranged wife, depending on how conscious their uncoupling is. Respect his wishes if he says he can't socialize with her. A screaming match is not a tasty side dish.Now, for your sister-in-law: No one (I know) wants to hear about our brother's infidelity, via text, from their estranged spouse. In your kindest voice, say: ""You know I love you. But I am not the person for you to confide in about my brother."" With the results of these separate conversations under your belt -- together with your impulse to be kind to the children -- decide whom you want to invite for Thanksgiving. It's your holiday, too.The Missing MomsFor several years, two gay couples and I (the host and lone singleton) have celebrated Thanksgiving with three of the crowd's widowed mothers. (The other two moms live at considerable distance.) Last year, one of the mothers died; and this year, another one passed away. So our party will be five men, one mother and strong memories of the two who passed. Any suggestions for keeping the party light and avoiding the feel of a memorial service?Joe, New York""There ought to be a hall of fame for mamas,"" as Glen Campbell and Steve Wariner sang pretty convincingly in the late '80s. But there isn't. So, while I understand your desire to avoid a maudlin turkey day, a party constituted consistently of the same small crew of mothers and sons will necessarily need a moment to mark the passing.Try going in the opposite direction from the one you're considering. Don't avoid the deaths. Start the party with a toast to the two mothers who have died. Their sons will appreciate it. And you will have noted the admirable ""through thick and thin"" nature of your Thanksgiving tradition. Also, by acknowledging the elephant in the room, you will create an opening for moving beyond it, to cheerier subjects, too.>The Rejected HostessLast month, I invited a single friend (without family) to join our small gathering for Thanksgiving. She accepted; then 10 days later, she told me she had just received an invitation from close friends with whom she had celebrated before and would be joining them, instead. I understand her preference to be with old friends, but I still feel rejected. Am I being hypersensitive, or could she have handled this better?Susan, Alameda, Calif.I am sorry that kindness landed you with hurt feelings. (And I don't think you are being hypersensitive, especially if you think of this woman as a friend and not merely as a ""holiday orphan."") She had a few options: Stick with the first invitation she accepted; deploy a white lie to spring herself from your dinner; or try a heart-to-heart with you, explaining her predicament. She went with option three and failed.Now, it's your turn: Tell her that her switch-up hurt your feelings. A sincere apology might make you feel better. Or leave things alone, if you prefer. But congratulate yourself on opening your home to someone without a place to go. That makes you a nice person, in my book.Boyfriend's a BoorTwo years ago, our daughter brought home her boyfriend for the holiday. He slept until 3 p.m. every day and stayed up all night drinking in their bedroom. We found this rude. She wants to bring him again this year, and we are dreading a repeat performance. What should we do?AnonymousTell your daughter you can't wait to see them. (It doesn't sound as if this beau is going anywhere.) Then add: ""But Jim's all-night drinking and all-day sleeping seemed antisocial to us. Let's agree that everyone's up by 11, this year, in time for turkey hash."" Some houseguests need boundaries spelled out.Defending the BossThe owner of the company I work for got into hot water for doing something insensitive. Social media had a field day with it. The story has mostly run its course, but I still find myself having to defend the owner (over a decision I had nothing to do with) or acquiesce to people I suspect of merely jumping on a bandwagon out of schadenfreude. How to quash these conversations?J.L., New YorkIn the immortal words sung by Whitney Houston, ""It's not right, but it's O.K."" Social media has shined a bright light on social justice issues. (Think of the tragic encounters between African-Americans and law enforcement.) Just last weekend, Facebook allowed Parisians to ""check in safe"" amid heartbreaking calamity. And social media hooked me up with my best pal from third grade. I am not going to dump on social media.Still, there is nothing (many) social media users love like piling on, especially when the whiff of sanctimony is in the air. Your boss was probably caught saying something stupid or offensive. Why would her or his defense be on you? Say: ""I only know what I saw on Twitter. Nothing juicy to add, I'm afraid."" Tamp down the embers of yesterday's controversy by being dull.Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion, and Vows), and Instagram.For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes­.com or SocialQ on Facebook.

'Last Days in Vietnam':   [The Arts/Cultural Desk ],,"[Video: Watch on YouTube.]As the war in Vietnam recedes deeper into history, replaced in the American consciousness by more recent conflicts in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, its lessons also seem to fade. That amnesia is what the film director and producer Rory Kennedy is trying to counteract in ""Last Days in Vietnam,"" one of five nominees for the Oscar for best feature-length documentary.True to its title, ""Last Days in Vietnam"" focuses on America's withdrawal from Saigon in April 1975, as the allied government of South Vietnam was collapsing in the face of a North Vietnamese offensive. Even as the United States ambassador, Graham Martin, seems slow to recognize the gravity of the situation, embassy staff members are shown working frantically to evacuate as many of their South Vietnamese counterparts as possible, sometimes ignoring or defying orders from Washington to do so.""I think there are moments of real inspiration in the film, where in that larger context there were people on the front lines, Americans and South Vietnamese alike, who in the face of those obstacles did the right thing,"" Ms. Kennedy, 46, said. ""I don't think the film makes you proud of American policy at that time. But it might make audience members proud of these Americans.""""Last Days in Vietnam,"" commissioned by PBS's ""American Experience"" series and scheduled to be broadcast this spring, is something of a reporting feat. Ms. Kennedy tracked down undeveloped and unseen film footage from important moments in the collapse and evacuation, and interviewed Americans and South Vietnamese involved in the effort, including some Vietnamese left behind, whom the new Communist government sent to re-education camps. She also managed to persuade the former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger to offer his account of what happened.Ms. Kennedy, the youngest child of Robert F. Kennedy, has been directing and producing documentaries, mostly with political or social themes, since the 1990s. In a telephone interview from Los Angeles last month, she discussed the historical context of her film and the tools available to her as a documentary filmmaker. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation:Q.For anyone who lived through this episode, it was depressing to revisit it. Was that your objective?A.The big context of this story is very depressing, what we did and how we went about it was certainly a dark moment in our nation's history. But I think the primary objective in making this film was that we are nearing the 40th anniversary, which is coming this April, and so it was a good time to look back at these events. It was two years ago that I was developing this film, and we were at the brink of withdrawing from Iraq and Afghanistan. So I thought that looking specifically at the end of Vietnam and what happened, there could be some lessons we could learn as a country about the art of getting out of a war that we haven't clearly won.Q.Was there also a didactic element involved? Your mention of the 40th anniversary reminds me there is a whole cohort of Americans who weren't alive at that time. Is there a need to remind them?A.I've gone to campuses with the film, and surprisingly many people today aren't studying Vietnam at all. So there is a generation of Americans who really have no knowledge of this war.Having made this film, I learned some lessons, and one of them is that by the time April 1975 came around, there were very few good options available to the U.S. government. What that says to me is that the time when we have the most strategic positioning is before we enter these wars, and that we need to ask the questions the film asks: What are our responsibilities to the people who are in these countries when we leave? What is our exit strategy? These are fundamental and important questions, and I hope my film is a reminder of the human cost of war.Q.PBS suggested the idea for ""Last Days in Vietnam"" to you. Did you hesitate at all about taking on the project?A.I was pretty much in instantly. I think there was a 72-hour period where I did the initial research and came to understand the events, that there was so much richness there. Honestly, for me as a filmmaker, I've probably made 35 films in my career, and this one was the one that was most dramatic and narratively contained. Everything else aside, it's a really good story, right? [Laughs] It's got a beginning, middle and end, it's got climactic moments, it builds in a dramatic way and feels like a Hollywood thriller. In all my other films, I've had to build them in the editing room. But this was inherently dramatic.Q.How do you see the evolution of documentary films over the time you've been working? What changes stand out most to you?A.You see a lot of crossover nowadays, in both directions. You see more Hollywood people, filmmakers and actors and executives on the dramatic feature side, who are jumping into the doc business. And I think we as the documentary community are watching Hollywood films and looking at new techniques and employing them. We understand that we need audiences to watch our films, and we want them to be both entertained and engaged, as well as be transported to understand other lives and perspectives. So I think there really is a sense you can do both, and that documentaries don't have to be spinach.Q.Do you personally feel that you now have more freedom, more arrows in your quiver, than you did say 10 years ago?A.I do. I go to Hollywood films and think about how to apply some of what I'm seeing to my documentaries. There are story points in the film that reminded me of ""Argo,"" like the files of people that needed to be disposed of at the last minute, or the money being burned. I debated whether to include those, because they made the film longer and were easy to just take out. But I thought those would speak to people because they had seen ""Argo"" and there were similar moments there.Q.You were shortlisted once before for the Oscar in this category, but this is your first nomination. What are your impressions of the process?A.I think the goal with all of these films is to get them to reach as large an audience as possible, and the Oscars and having a nominated film can enhance that. So we are all invested in that process. And I think it's also a community that is really supportive of each other and appreciates how hard it is to make a documentary and get distribution. [Laughs] So it's a nice affirming thing.You know there are many, many wonderful lives that films have, and I have made dozens that haven't been nominated. It's not the end of the world, but this is very nice icing on the cake.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",0.0

The Longevity Feast:   [Style Desk ],,"Dan Buettner and I were off to a good start. He approved of coffee.""It's one of the biggest sources of antioxidants in the American diet,"" he said with chipper confidence, folding up his black Brompton bike.As we walked through Greenwich Village, looking for a decent shot of joe to fuel an afternoon of shopping and cooking and talking about the enigma of longevity, he pointed out that the men and women of Icaria, a Greek island in the middle of the Aegean Sea, regularly slurp down two or three muddy cups a day.This came as delightful news to me. Icaria has a key role in Mr. Buettner's latest book, ""The Blue Zones Solution,"" which takes a deep dive into five places around the world where people have a beguiling habit of forgetting to die. In Icaria they stand a decent chance of living to see 100. Without coffee, I don't see much point in making it to 50.The purpose of our rendezvous was to see whether the insights of a longevity specialist like Mr. Buettner could be applied to the life of a food-obsessed writer in New York, a man whose occupational hazards happen to include chicken wings, cheeseburgers, martinis and marathon tasting menus.Covering the world of gastronomy and mixology during the era of David Chang (career-defining dish: those Momofuku pork-belly buns) and April Bloomfield (career-defining dish: the lamb burger at the Breslin Bar and Dining Room) does not exactly feel like an enterprise that's adding extra years to my life -- or to my liver.And the recent deaths (even if accidental) of men in my exact demographic -- the food writer Joshua Ozersky, the tech entrepreneur Dave Goldberg -- had put me in a mortality-anxious frame of mind.With my own half-century mark eerily visible on the horizon, could Mr. Buettner, who has spent the last 10 years unlocking the mysteries of longevity, offer me a midcourse correction?To that end, he had decided to cook me something of a longevity feast. Visiting from his home in Minnesota and camped out at the townhouse of his friends Andrew Solomon and John Habich in the Village, this trim, tanned, 55-year-old guru of the golden years was geared up to show me that living a long time was not about subsisting on a thin gruel of, well, gruel.After that blast of coffee, which I dutifully diluted with soy milk (as instructed) at O Cafe on Avenue of the Americas, Mr. Buettner and I set forth on our quest at the aptly named LifeThyme market, where signs in the window trumpeted the wonders of wheatgrass. He reassured me, again, by letting me know that penitent hedge clippings had no place in our Blue Zones repast.""People think, 'If I eat more of this, then it's O.K. to eat more burgers or candy,' "" he said. Instead, as he ambled through the market dropping herbs and vegetables into his basket, he insisted that our life-extending banquet would hinge on normal affordable items that almost anyone can pick up at the grocery store. He grabbed fennel and broccoli, celery and carrots, tofu and coconut milk, a bag of frozen berries and a can of chickpeas and a jar of local honey.The five communities spotlighted in ""The Blue Zones Solution"" (published by National Geographic) depend on simple methods of cooking that have evolved over centuries, and Mr. Buettner has developed a matter-of-fact disregard for gastro-trends of all stripes. At LifeThyme, he passed by refrigerated shelves full of vogue-ish juices in hues of green, orange and purple. He shook his head and said, ""Bad!""""The glycemic index on that is as bad as Coke,"" he went on, snatching a bottle of carrot juice to scan the label. ""For eight ounces, there's 14 grams of sugar. People get suckered into thinking, 'Oh, I'm drinking this juice.' Skip the juicing. Eat the fruit. Or eat the vegetable."" (How about a protein shake? ""No,"" he said.)So far, I was feeling pretty good about my chances of making it to 100. I love coffee, I'm not much of a juicer and I've never had a protein shake in my life. Bingo. I figured that pretty soon Mr. Buettner would throw me a dietary curveball (I noticed with vague concern that he was not putting any meat or cheese into his basket), but by this point I was already thinking about how fun it would be to meet my great-grandchildren.I felt even better when he and I started talking about strenuous exercise, which for me falls somewhere between ""root canal"" and ""Justin Bieber concert"" on the personal aversion scale.I like to go for long walks, and ... well, that's about it.""That's when I knew you'd be O.K.,"" Mr. Buettner told me.It turns out that walking is a popular mode of transport in the Blue Zones, too -- particularly on the sun-splattered slopes of Sardinia, Italy, where many of those who make it to 100 are shepherds who devote the bulk of each day to wandering the hills and treating themselves to sips of red wine.""A glass of wine is better than a glass of water with a Mediterranean meal,"" Mr. Buettner told me.Red wine and long walks? If that's all it takes, people, you're looking at Methuselah.O.K., yes, Mr. Buettner moves his muscles a lot more than I do. He likes to go everywhere on that fold-up bike, which he hauls along with him on trips, and sometimes he does yoga and goes in-line skating. But he generally believes that the high-impact exercise mania as practiced in the major cities of the United States winds up doing as much harm as good.""You can't be pounding your joints with marathons and pumping iron,"" he said. ""You'll never see me doing CrossFit.""For that evening's meal, Mr. Buettner planned to cook dishes that would make reference to the quintet of places that he focuses on in ""The Blue Zones Solution"": along with Icaria and Sardinia, they are Okinawa, Japan; the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica; and Loma Linda, Calif., where Seventh-day Adventists have a tendency to outlive their fellow Americans, thanks to a mostly vegetarian diet that is heavy on nuts, beans, oatmeal, 100 percent whole-grain bread and avocados.We walked from the market to the townhouse. And it was here, as Mr. Buettner laid out his cooking ingredients on a table in Mr. Solomon's and Mr. Habich's commodious, state-of-the-art kitchen, that I noticed the first real disconnect between the lives of the Blue Zones sages and the life of a food writer who has enjoyed many a lunch hour scarfing down charcuterie, tapas and pork-belly-topped ramen at the Gotham West Market food court.Where was the butter? Hadn't some nice scientists determined that butter's not so lethal for us, after all? (""My view is that butter, lard and other animal fats are a bit like radiation: a dollop a couple of times a week probably isn't going to hurt you, but we don't know the safe level,"" Mr. Buettner later wrote in an email. ""At any rate, I can send along a paper that largely refutes the whole 'Butter is Back' craze."" No, thanks, I'm good.)Where was the meat? Where was the cheese? (No cheese? And here I thought we'd be friends for another 50 years, Mr. Buettner.)""If you're eating this meal, you're getting all the protein you need,"" he promised me, although it wasn't my protein intake I was worried about.Although it is by no means a stealth vegan manifesto, ""The Blue Zones Solution"" frequently mentions that men and women in these longevity-friendly regions tend to eat meat and fish only sparingly, and they almost never tangle with cow's milk. Mr. Buettner had leapt to the conclusion that I had probably had enough meat and cheese for the week already. He was correct.""We're making up for all your sins tonight,"" he told me. ""What you learn tonight is going to set you on a new path.""The centerpiece of Mr. Buettner's dinner was a dish he had named ""Icarian stew,"" which involved a big pot of black-eyed peas, fennel, onions, garlic, carrots, canned tomatoes and other plant-based delights simmered for hours and then topped with a few glugs of extra-virgin olive oil.""I eat this all the time,"" he said. ""This is how I seduced Kathy Freston, by the way. You ask her. Ask her if Icarian stew has any role in her love for me."" (Mr. Buettner is dating Ms. Freston, the author and advocate of veganism who used to be married to Tom Freston, the former MTV executive.)Raised in Minnesota, Mr. Buettner (pronounced BYOOT-ner) grew up eating ""hotdish and Hamburger Helper -- the usual Midwest crap,"" he said.But in 2005 he wrote an article about the secrets of longevity for National Geographic, and the lightning-striking success of it bestowed upon him both a career mission (starting with his first book, ""The Blue Zones: 9 Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest,"" in 2008) and a new mode of looking at food.He's now a fierce believer in Japanese yams, wild greens and milk thistle. (Throughout ""The Blue Zones Solution,"" he stresses that people in these parts of the world don't just happen to live a long time, they do so with lower rates of the diabetes, heart disease and dementia that seem to afflict much of the junk-food-gobbling globe.)Not long ago he dropped by the Mayo Clinic to meet a doctor for an executive physical. ""I wanted to see if it really paid off,"" Mr. Buettner said. ""And apparently it has. I had the clearest arteries he'd ever seen in a 54-year-old man.""Nevertheless, his findings over the last decade do put him at odds with a controversial range of culinary belief systems.During our afternoon and evening together, he joked that the paleo diet is fine if all you want is the life expectancy of a cave man. The raw food movement? Mr. Buettner brushed it aside and pointed out that in all of the Blue Zones, people cook their meals, sometimes for hours.Fear of a wheat planet? ""Bogus,"" he said. After a couple of hours in the kitchen, Mr. Buettner defied the carb-avoiders and gluten-dodgers of America by dashing over to Union Square on foot to score several loaves of long-fermented, freshly baked sourdough at Breads Bakery.""A true sourdough bread will actually lower the glycemic load of a meal,"" he said. ""But it has to be a real sourdough bread."" (Whew. We were back to the good news.)After a bunch of his friends had gathered in the kitchen (Mr. Buettner referred to them as his New York ""moai,"" which is an Okinawan term for a circle of people who purposefully meet up and look out for one another), he opened a bottle of hard-to-find Sardinian wine and asked them to take their seats. Among them were Mr. Solomon, the author of books like ""Far From the Tree"" and ""The Noonday Demon,"" and Samantha Boardman, a psychiatrist and the wife of the real-estate tycoon Aby J. Rosen.There came a broccoli soup thickened with cashew cream; a simple Japanese paste made from mixing sweet potato and coconut milk; a honey-touched tofu parfait crowned with a berry compote, which Mr. Buettner called ""a little naughty"" because it was sweeter than what you would normally find in a sugar-averse Blue Zone. (Naughty? I guess Mr. Buettner has never had the gochujang Buffalo wings at Seoul Chicken.)Mr. Solomon, although enthusiastic about the longevity feast, appeared to be reading my mind. ""No cheese in Sardinia?"" he asked, a trace of longing in his voice.The meal itself was delicious and nourishing, even if there were moments when my restaurant-conditioned palate was crying out for salt. In a sense, though, the meal was almost beside the point, blurring as it went on into waves of wine and conviviality.Along the way, Mr. Buettner stage-whispered into Mr. Solomon's ear, asking whether our host might be willing to dip into the wine cellar for a special bottle or two. Icaria is known for the longevity of its residents; it's also known for Dionysian all-night parties. I can't say for sure whether I felt longevity coursing through my veins, but there was a fair amount of alcohol.""The secret sauce is the right mix of friends,"" Mr. Buettner said.And as each course arrived (the Icarian stew claiming its rich, flavor-deep place as an obvious showstopper), Mr. Buettner called attention to a last point about the Blue Zones: that in longevity idylls like Icaria, it's not just about what you eat, but how you eat, and how much you and your friends enjoy a meal together.""Dan, do any of the Blue Zones people eat kale salad?"" Mr. Solomon asked.""No,"" Mr. Buettner replied. ""They eat food that they enjoy.""Photograph Dan Buettner, Who Writes Books On Achieving a Long Life, in Part by Eating Healthfully, Shopping at the Lifethyme Market in Greenwich Village.

Activist Hedge Fund Takes a Sizable Stake in Amex,,"ValueAct Capital Management, a prominent activist hedge fund, has taken a significant stake in American Express, which is grappling with a number of recent challenges. Should ValueAct press forward with an activist campaign, American Express would be its latest prominent target. ValueAct has pressed for change at Microsoft, among others, in recent years. Shares of American Express jumped more than 6 percent after Bloomberg News reported that the hedge fund had assembled a position worth about $1 billion. While a significant amount, that holding would still rank the activist investor below American Express's top 10 shareholders. Over the last year, American Express has faced several setbacks, including revenue that has fallen short of analysts' expectations and the loss of a longstanding partnership with Costco. The credit card company was also forced to rearrange its leadership after the death of Edward P. Gilligan, its president and heir apparent, in late May.",0.0
Shire's $30 Billion Offer for Maker of Drugs for Rare Diseases Is Rebuffed:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"LONDON -- The global pursuit of deals by drug makers took a turn on Tuesday as a former target of a mega-merger turned predator.Shire, which last year had sought to sell itself to AbbVie, disclosed that its $30 billion offer for the biopharmaceutical company Baxalta had been rebuffed last month.The rejection of the offer was affirmed later on Tuesday, as Baxalta said that its board and advisers had reviewed Shire's proposal and concluded that it ""significantly undervalues"" the biopharmaceutical company.Still, by going public with the all-stock offer -- which represented a 36 percent premium to Monday's closing price of Baxalta's stock -- Shire, which is based in Dublin, is trying to put pressure on Baxalta to come to the negotiating table by appealing to its shareholders.""Other than a brief meeting on July 10th at which we outlined our proposal and its benefits, your lack of engagement has been surprising,"" Flemming Ornskov, Shire's chief executive, wrote in a letter to his counterpart at Baxalta on Tuesday. ""As a result, you have left us with no choice but to make our proposal known to your shareholders. We believe they deserve an opportunity to consider it.""Baxalta's largest shareholder is the company that it was spun out of, Baxter International, which has a 19.5 percent stake. The spinoff, which was announced in September, was completed on July 1.A merger would create a giant in the treatment of rare diseases. The combined companies would generate $20 billion in product sales by 2020 -- 65 percent of that on drugs focusing on rare diseases, Shire said.""We believe the proposed combination of Shire and Baxalta would be strategically and financially attractive for both of our companies, accelerating our respective growth ambitions and creating the leading global biotech company in rare diseases,"" Mr. Ornskov said in a news release.But Baxalta, which is based in Bannockburn, Ill., disagreed with Shire's stated strategic logic for a merger and emphasized that it had been an independent, publicly traded company only since July 1.""A transaction at this time would be severely disruptive to our young organization and the implementation of a wide variety of critical commercial, R.&D. and operational initiatives, and thus carries with it significant risks for our shareholders,"" Ludwig N. Hantson, the chief executive of Baxalta, wrote in a letter to Mr. Ornskov.If Shire ultimately prevails, it would be the latest acquisition in what has been an active deal-making slate since the $54 billion sale of Shire to AbbVie, another big drug maker based in Illinois, fell through last year. AbbVie walked away from the deal after the Treasury Department announced new rules aimed at reining in inversions, in which a company reincorporates in a country with lower corporate taxes.In January, Shire acquired NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion. Shire also reportedly considered a bid for Salix Pharmaceuticals this year before Valeant Pharmaceuticals International clinched a deal for the company.And Shire agreed on Monday to acquire Foresight Biotherapeutics, a privately held maker of drugs to treat eye conditions, including a drug in late-stage development to treat pink eye, for $300 million.Under the terms of the offer disclosed on Tuesday, Shire said it would pay $45.23 a share for Baxalta, representing a 36 percent premium to its closing price on Monday.Shares of Baxalta rose 12 percent, to $37.10. In London trading, shares of Shire fell more than 5 percent.After the transaction closes, Shire said it would initiate a share buyback program and, within two years, repurchase up to 13 percent of the combined company's outstanding shares.Evercore and Morgan Stanley and the law firms Ropes & Gray and Slaughter and May are advising Shire.Goldman Sachs and Citigroup and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis are advising the board of Baxalta.",0.0
"A Sprawling Manor for $125,000 (Some Disassembly Required):   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"YORKTOWN, N.Y. -- It might just be one of the greatest real estate deals in New York. For $125,000, a roughly 8,000-square-foot Tudor home overlooking lakes and forests in a nature preserve here is up for grabs, the epitome of baronial-bucolic Westchester County living.Built or, more accurately, assembled 101 years ago by Arthur S. Vernay, a noted British antiques dealer and adventurer, much of the house is arguably much older. Brought over in crates from England, it includes a pair of fireplaces from 1357, a 300-pound wrought-iron door and wooden timbers weighing half a ton that adorn the ceiling in the great room.The only catch for today's buyers is that they must pull a Vernay and pull the house down, carting off all or some of it to create their own Frankenstein castle. That, and endure the howls of preservationists who view the house as an integral piece of the land it sits on.Fights over tear-downs are nothing new in the suburbs, but it is no megamansion builder who wants the house gone -- it is the nature preserve that owns it. To fulfill its mission to protect the environment, the preserve says it must sacrifice the house, even if it is piece by period piece.""In a perfect world, we could afford to fix the house and find a use for it, but our responsibility is to a thousand acres of woodlands, not a single house,"" said Kevin Carter, executive director of the preserve, the Teatown Lake Reservation.The reservation lies south of the New Croton Reservoir and the Taconic State Parkway. Nestled squarely in the middle of the protected land is the home, known as the Croft, which Teatown bought for $3 million in 2010, along with the 67 acres that surround it. The land was the real prize.""It was the hole in the doughnut,"" Mr. Carter said last week at his desk inside a former 30-horse stable that was turned into offices and a nature center decades ago.Initially, the hope had been to do a similar conversion of the Croft, and a prospective buyer was even turned down. But the house, despite its provenance, has been altered in some unfortunate ways over the years -- pink shag carpet, asbestos tiles -- and many of its mechanical systems might as well have been imported from Elizabethan England.""There's a reason there are so many fireplaces in here,"" said John DeVito, a former Teatown board president and a contractor who coordinated a four-year review of the property.The multimillion-dollar estimate to renovate the house and bring it up to code proved prohibitive (Teatown's annual budget is only $2 million). Apartments, park offices, a conference center, and even a farm-to-table restaurant were considered. The board also decided it was better to eliminate any environmental, as well as budgetary, impacts from continued occupancy.""It was a wrenching decision,"" Mr. DeVito said.The outcry from local preservationists has been swift and loud, despite the house's relative anonymity in a community brimming with Gilded Age retreats and Colonial-era farmsteads, many already encased in amber or cobwebs.Still, the Croft stands out.The original house, which was expanded in the 1930s, is noteworthy because it is mostly made from imported pieces, according to ""Moving Rooms: The Trade in Architectural Salvages,"" a 2007 book on the popular practice of salvaging (or pillaging) some 700 British buildings for use in America. That sets it apart from the various Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and similar estates, which simply incorporated historical pieces into larger contemporary properties.""Every particle of material used in the structure once formed a part of some ancient English dwelling,"" declared an article in the Aug. 2, 1914, edition of the New York Herald Sunday magazine.Furthermore, preservationists argue that Teatown and the Croft are intrinsically linked, and the principles of conservation and preservation should be working in concert, not conflict.""To tear down the house is to rip out the heart of the estate as it originally was,"" said Jean-François de Lapérouse, the chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission of Yorktown. ""There would be no Teatown without the house.""Not long after completing the Croft, Vernay sold it to Daniel R. Hanna, a Cleveland newspaper and iron magnate, who built the stables. After Mr. Hanna's death, the estate was sold in 1922 for $240,000 to Gerard Swope, the president of General Electric.Six years after Mr. Swope's death in 1957, his heirs donated 194 acres of the property to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, planting the seeds of Teatown. It became a separate entity in 1971 and steadily expanded over the years. Today, there are 15 miles of trails and about 30,000 visitors.The Croft and some of the land remained private, owned for decades by Phil Gilbert Jr., a Manhattan lawyer. After he died in 2008, his heirs sold the property to Teatown.Since Teatown announced plans to dismantle the Croft last month, it has received a number of responses, including two local residents and a woman in Maryland who wants to incorporate the entire house into a new home. Another Westchester County resident covets the oak-paneled Jacobean living room, but Teatown prefers one buyer who will take everything.The preservationists have attracted interest as well, winning support from the Preservation League of New York and the Royal Oak Foundation, the American arm of the National Trust, Britain's chief conservation organization. And the state's Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation sent a letter noting it had already considered the Croft for the Register of Historic Places, though this is more a tax incentive than demolition safeguard.Should a sale occur, Teatown might not abandon the house entirely. One popular proposal was suggested by Timothy Hartung, a local resident and a partner at Ennead Architects, based in Manhattan. He recommended that some elements, perhaps a fireplace or a chimney or some of the gables, be incorporated into a pavilion or other architectural marker.""We don't want to strip the home completely out of our story,"" Mr. Carter said.",0.0
Shakespeare With a New Jersey Accent:   [Review ],,"LENOX, Mass. -- She is a magnificent specimen: the hair big and honey blond, the clothes snug and revealing, the jewelry copious and gold. Meticulously manicured, stalking around in screaming-orange sandals with wedge heels that would maim a weaker woman, the aggrieved Adriana is pure Jersey girl -- the stereotypical variety.She is also a hilariously high-strung delight to behold in Taibi Magar's effervescent staging of ""The Comedy of Errors"" here at Shakespeare & Company, where Kelley Curran unapologetically steals the show with an Adriana who is all defiant posing and tangy Garden State vowels.Yes, yes, Shakespeare's ""The Comedy of Errors"" is the mistaken-identity farce about the two almost indistinguishably named sets of long-lost identical twins, and Adriana isn't among them. Her straying husband, Antipholus of Ephesus (Ian Lassiter), is, though, and can she help it if she loves the creep and just wants him to come home?Operatic in both anger and misery, Adriana thinks nothing of swatting their servant, Dromio of Ephesus (Aaron Bartz), with the foil reflector she uses for sunbathing, and she weeps extravagantly when her steadfast sister, Luciana (Cloteal L. Horne), reports that Antipholus came on to her. But when Luciana confesses that her smitten brother-in-law also praised her beauty -- it was actually her brother-in-law's twin, but she doesn't know that -- Adriana flies into a wounded rage.""Didst speak him fair?"" she yowls. The furious list of insults with which she proceeds to indict him is comical, ridiculous, as self-dramatizing as anything on reality TV -- and sympathetic, too. Beneath all the Jersey girl trappings is a human being, not a Real Housewife, and that lends heft to a production so fizzy that it might otherwise float off into the ether.Punctuated with bursts of pop music (Whitney Houston's ""I Have Nothing"" makes a triumphant appearance) and jubilant dance (choreographed by Jesse Perez), the show moves at an almost manic pace, and the frivolity sometimes seems forced. With Mr. Lassiter doubling as Antipholus of Syracuse, and Mr. Bartz doubling as his servant, Dromio of Syracuse, these upscale boys glide into Ephesus on a yellow tandem bike and forever after reach for their hand sanitizer, repelled by their proximity to the gaudy locals with their Jersey tones.Clad in leather clogs and earthy-chic cotton (the costumes are by Tilly Grimes), Luciana stands apart. When she and Antipholus of Syracuse touch for the first time, the connection between them is electric -- a cause for horror in Luciana, who believes this is her brother-in-law. Happily for us, Ms. Horne does a very funny freakout.Ms. Magar created a problem for herself in single-casting each pair of twins, who must meet in the climactic scene. Her solution is in keeping with the playful spirit of this 90-minute production. But she goes the hoary route in having a man, Douglas Seldin, play Luce, Adriana's maid, an aggressively amorous woman so unattractive that she looks like a large, hairy guy. That's the whole joke, and it's awfully stale.Yet much of the rest, on John McDermott's grassy set, has the loose and friendly feel of a barbecue in the park -- picnic table, busy boombox and all.""The Comedy of Errors"" continues through Aug. 23 in the Tina Packer Playhouse at Shakespeare & Company, Lenox, Mass.; 413-637-3353, shakespeare.org.Photograph The Comedy of Errors: Kelley Curran, Center, in This Production Staged by Taibi Magar at Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, Mass.; Ian Lassiter, Left, and Aaron Bartz in This Mistaken-Identity Farce About Two Similarly Named Sets of Twins.

"Ferguson Sees Change, but Asks if It's Real:   [National Desk ]",,"FERGUSON, Mo. -- Brianna West stepped before the judge as her daughter Morgan, 3, fidgeted beside her. Ms. West had waited weeks to get this case behind her, facing citations that included failure to comply with a police officer. She worried about steep fines, even jail time, on charges she felt were baseless. But the hearing brought relief.A newly appointed judge, Donald McCullin, who like Ms. West is African-American, ordered her to spend 10 hours performing community service. ""He was trying to help me,"" Ms. West said, clearly surprised.It was a starkly different scene from what Ferguson residents faced in this municipal court a year ago before the city was torn by unrest after a white police officer's fatal shooting of a black, unarmed teenager named Michael Brown, before it became a symbol of racial inequities, before a Justice Department investigation concluded that the city unconstitutionally targeted black people for an array of fees and fines largely intended to raise revenue. The department also concluded that the shooting did not warrant criminal charges.Yet if Judge McCullin seems a burst of fresh air for Ferguson, he is only a temporary one. Under Missouri court-retirement rules, he must step down in about eight months when he turns 75. And he is not the only change that may prove fleeting. The city just hired a new police chief and city manager -- also African-Americans -- to replace white officials who had overseen operations that came under scathing criticism in the Justice Department report. But they, too, are interim hires that may end in a matter of months; the new chief is merely on a leave of absence from his department in another state.As it prepares to mark a year since Mr. Brown's death this Sunday, Ferguson, a mostly black community of 21,000 in the patchwork of suburbs north of St. Louis, remains very much a halting work in progress. In recent months, it has taken steps toward repairing racial scars, rebuilding its battered commercial areas and diversifying its once white-dominated government.Yet like so much that was exposed a year ago, Ferguson remains divided -- this time between those who think its progress is real, and those who believe that little beyond the superficial has changed.""This was a real tearing of the fabric,"" said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. ""A lot of pent-up frustration has now really come forward, and that doesn't get well in 12 months. This isn't going to happen overnight. It's not even going to be over 365 nights. It's going to be years.""Nightly protests here have faded in recent months, but law enforcement officials in the region are bracing for a new wave of memorials, concerts, demonstrations, road closings and acts of civil disobedience expected this weekend in commemoration of the anniversary. The family of Mr. Brown has called for peaceful vigils, but the police in the region appear to have prepared for any outcome.Improvements here are undeniable. The local, state and federal authorities point to new programs and new laws enacted since the unrest, including increased funds for job training and college assistance, and legislation lowering the percentage of revenue Missouri cities can make from traffic fines and fees -- described by Gov. Jay Nixon as ""the most sweeping municipal court reform in state history.""Not far from a commercial district scarred by arson, Starbucks plans to open for the first time. The Urban League recently announced a job training center on the site of a convenience store that was looted and burned in the demonstrations that followed Mr. Brown's death.Even the Missouri National Guard, which responded to unrest that grew violent at times last August and November, plans to convert a shuttered building into an armory where it would try to recruit more Guard members from urban areas, federal officials said.Perhaps most significant, city leaders say they have revamped their municipal court system, replacing the longtime judge, and two widely criticized practices: holding people in jail for days on minor offenses when they could not post bonds, and piling on new ""failure to appear"" charges against those who miss court.""Look, I want to be clear in no uncertain terms -- this city has improved,"" said Wesley Bell, a newly elected City Council member who is black and represents the neighborhood where Mr. Brown died.Just below the surface, though, some of the city's biggest problems remain as daunting as ever. The police force, overwhelmingly white when Mr. Brown was killed, remains overwhelmingly white today. Efforts to institute ""community-based"" policing to improve relations with African-American residents appear to be only in the early stages.A sea of ideas considered by a state-appointed Ferguson Commission, including raising the minimum wage and consolidating tiny police departments, remain proposals. Similarly, the Missouri legislature considered more than 20 bills to change law enforcement policies, but only one -- the new cap on traffic ticket revenues -- passed.Perhaps most telling, on the streets near the apartment complexes where Mr. Brown died, people say they feel just as estranged from the police as they did a year ago, just as skeptical of this city's leaders -- black or white.""The mind-set is still that it's normal to have the police stop African-Americans and harass us and shake us down,"" said Phil Gassoway, a Ferguson resident and regular at local demonstrations. ""That's the norm -- still is. There's no change nowhere.""Commercial Districts ScarredNearly all of Ferguson was upended by the months of unrest that followed Mr. Brown's death. But the widely televised looting, fires and violent clashes between the police and protesters left the largest bruises in two of the city's distinct commercial districts, less than two miles apart.Along South Florissant Road, a quaint thoroughfare, frequent confrontations took place between demonstrators and officers in riot gear outside Police Headquarters. After a grand jury chose not to indict the police officer, Darren Wilson, in November, businesses here were looted and vandalized.In the other commercial district, along West Florissant Avenue -- a grittier, wide strip of telephone stores and beauty supply companies close to where Mr. Brown died -- the damage was worse. Officers in large military-style vehicles clashed with large groups of marchers and, in August and November, some businesses were looted or burned to the ground.The recovery, like so much else here, seems uneven.Along West Florissant, several stores have shuttered for good, stray garbage blows across lots filled with broken glass and graffiti covers the wooden boards. Many of the shoppers here come from nearby apartment complexes that house some of the city's poorest residents. Among them: Canfield Green, where Mr. Brown died and where demonstrations boiled over night after night. It has not helped West Florissant that some of the complexes have lost occupants, their residents fleeing to get away from the discord.""Business is absolutely not back,"" said Jay L. Kanzler Jr., a lawyer who represents some shop owners. ""The people who have come back are there only because they put their blood, sweat and tears into it.""Charles Davis, a Ferguson resident who owns Ferguson Burger Bar & More with his wife, Kizzie, opened his doors for the first time the day before Mr. Brown died. The restaurant was never boarded up, or harmed, during the unrest. ""I have a protector that's bigger than me,"" Mr. Davis said.But images of police officers in riot gear linger.""We never owned another restaurant before,"" Mr. Davis said. ""We don't know what to expect other than this. We don't have a history that doesn't include all this.""On the other side of town, along South Florissant Road, fewer traces of the violence remain. Owners here say business is returning, and that a developer has even pitched a project of apartments and stores in the area. Already home to a wine bar and bakery, a cigar bar moved in not long ago. So did a new restaurant, J&C BBQ and Blues.One of the newer storefronts offers a counterpoint to the once-nightly protests outside the police station. The I Love Ferguson store is jammed with merchandise that declares just that: ""I love Ferguson"" shirts, caps and cups, even a children's photo book, ""Painting for Peace in Ferguson"" (for $15.95), of murals painted on boarded-up businesses here last year.Run by a nonprofit that donates its proceeds -- more than $100,000 so far -- to community causes, the group began with simple yard signs promoted by a white former mayor who in April won a spot on the City Council. Some demonstrators and black residents see that message as a rejection of urgent calls for change, but group members see things differently.""We love Ferguson and we are here to do anything we can to keep our Ferguson the way it is,"" said Barbara Tipsword, a volunteer at the store.Ms. Tipsword, 85, was stunned by the angry protests after Mr. Brown's killing, having long thought of Ferguson as a model of integration. Over the last 25 years, Ferguson has shifted from nearly three-quarters white to two-thirds black. In the 1990s, a group formed here called Proud, which stood for People Reaching Out for Unity and Diversity, to promote integration. Some here say they had forgotten all about the group largely because its goals, they thought, had long since been met.""We integrated so well, I had thought,"" Ms. Tipsword said. ""I just didn't know.""She is not particularly sympathetic to the protesters, saying they did not represent the views of Ferguson residents. But she also said she had become more aware of the anger black residents feel toward the police.""I guess the people of Ferguson were complacent,"" she said. ""There was another thing going on for some people.""A New Public FaceAs children gathered for day camp in a room down the hall last month, Andre Anderson, a black police commander from Glendale, Ariz., took to a podium in front of television cameras to be introduced as this city's new, interim police chief.""We cannot do this without you,"" Chief Anderson told the gathered crowd at the community center, emphasizing his commitment to a new kind of inclusive, community-centered policing. He was flanked by Ed Beasley, an African-American who had previously been the city manager in Glendale, and who had been announced as Ferguson's interim city manager a month earlier. Standing nearby, too, were new members of Ferguson's City Council, including two African-Americans who were elected in April, increasing the number of black people on the seven-member Council to three from one.It was a snapshot of an abruptly altered public face for Ferguson.The pressure to swiftly present a new image here is palpable. City leaders say they hope to reach a settlement with the Justice Department over its findings that the city's law enforcement policies were predatory, and that city officials stood by as some employees shared racist emails.But much remains in flux. Efforts to hire more black officers have moved slowly: A year ago at this time, four of the city's approximately 50 officers were black; by this week, five were, including Chief Anderson. For now, Chief Anderson is expected to stay only six months; hiring permanent police chiefs and city managers can take as long as nine months, officials here say. (The city already has a number of vacant jobs, including human resources director and public works director.)And Mayor James Knowles III, 36, who is white and once led a Young Republicans group, not only remains in office but said he was likely to seek a third term for his part-time job, to the dismay of protesters who have demanded his ouster.Tony Rice, a local activist who led the unsuccessful push to recall Mr. Knowles, scoffed at what he viewed as the cynicism of the city's rush to announce interim hires. ""This is almost the most backwards-thinking thing you can think of -- running out and getting a black police chief, a black city manager and a black judge,"" he said.""Every time they've made a move to do something for the community they were pushed and dragged to do it,"" Mr. Rice said. ""Somebody forcing you to change is not change.""Some of the changes are striking. In a municipal court session in the City Council chambers one recent evening, Judge McCullin asked a woman with a cane to return in a few weeks with evidence of her indigence so she could avoid a fine. For a man with a $756 fine, the judge considered time the man had served in jail already and lowered the fee accordingly.Community service -- once a rarity here -- is more the norm under Judge McCullin, a former St. Louis circuit court judge with a puff of white hair who in June was called back from judicial retirement at age 74 to take this post. The fines he levies are, unlike in Ferguson's past, uniform. But he is expected to retire once more in several months.""There are still problems,"" Judge McCullin said in an interview. ""But we have done a lot.""City officials also assert that a culture change is underway in the Police Department. Officers wear body cameras, and beat officers have begun attending neighborhood meetings. With the help of a consultant, the department plans by January to reorganize schedules and beats so that all officers focus on developing closer bonds with the neighborhoods they patrol, Mayor Knowles said.Dominica Fuller, a police officer who has worked in Ferguson for 17 years and was promoted to sergeant in May -- the highest-ranking black woman in department history -- said some officers were trying to interact differently.""You don't know what type of day that person had and why they're speeding home,"" she said. ""They could have a sick child. They could have just gotten fired. You don't know. These are some of the things that some of our officers themselves are starting to do soul-searching about.""But the changes are not universally seen in a positive light. Mayor Knowles said a sharp decline in traffic stops might actually be a sign that the police are afraid to do their job.""We barely pull anybody over anymore,"" he said. Noting that some have suggested that police officers nationally may be behaving less aggressively amid post-Ferguson scrutiny, he said: ""I hate that people call this 'the Ferguson effect.' I've told people they should call it the Eric Holder effect -- when you have the top law enforcement agent in the country come in and scare police from doing their job.""""I have officers that tell me 'I don't know what I'm supposed to do out there,' "" he continued. "" 'I'm scared to pull somebody over because I'm going to be called a racist.' ""Problems With Police LingerIn the mostly African-American neighborhood of low-slung rental apartment complexes near where Mr. Brown died, the mayor's views are not widely shared.People here say the police still treat residents suspiciously, still bark questions, still make arrests for what they consider trivial charges.""They hassle you for no reason at all,"" said Ms. West, the woman who was among those summoned to appear in Ferguson's municipal courtroom one evening last month.City officials say Ms. West was cited for ""failure to comply"" and making a false police report. She was also arrested on an outstanding warrant, according to records, because she owed $77 of an earlier fine for stealing a shower curtain and shower hooks worth about $29.Ms. West, 21, tells a somewhat different story of the recent arrest. She said she was arguing with her boyfriend outside her apartment in May when an officer approached. They told the officer there was nothing wrong, she said. ""He told me if I didn't give him my Social Security number, he was going to lock me up -- and he did,"" she said.In its critique of Ferguson, the Justice Department singled out the ""failure to comply"" ordinance -- which requires people to identify themselves to the police -- as a violation that Ferguson's police officers routinely used to arrest people without proper cause.It is difficult to assess whether Ms. West's arrest was appropriate, as the city declined to provide details or additional records on the two most recent counts against her. She pleaded guilty to those counts, and the judge suspended imposition of a sentence on them, the city said.To many black residents, her case exemplifies a continuing problem that is unlikely to be fixed anytime soon.""The relationship still needs to change between police and the people because that's been the biggest issue in Ferguson for years,"" said Mr. Davis, the restaurant owner. ""It took how long to get it to where it was? So for people to feel that it's going to take a year or less than a year to make some miraculous change, that's just not going to happen.""AuthorAffiliation MONICA DAVEY Mitch Smith contributed reporting from Chicago.",0.0
Chinese Club Team Thrives as National Squad Sputters:   [Sports Desk ],,"A victory by Guangzhou Evergrande in the A.F.C. Champions League, the biggest competition for club soccer in Asia, offered a quick hangover cure for Chinese fans reeling from the continuing struggles of their country's national team.The 1-0 win in the second leg of the finals against the United Arab Emirates' Al Ahli on Saturday gave Guangzhou its second Asian Champions League title in three years. Its 2013 title was the first by a Chinese club.Last week, China's men's national team drew, 0-0, with Hong Kong in a match colored by domestic rivalry and political discontent. The tie made it unlikely that China will advance to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, which provoked angry reactions from Chinese fans and demands that the team's coach, Alain Perrin, be fired.The long-running travails of China's national team are a source of endless distress to Chinese soccer enthusiasts, and Guangzhou's recent success has prompted further head-scratching. Many sports pages have asked what the vastly different fate of the national team says about the state of soccer in China. ""Evergrande's Victory Confirms the Strength of Chinese Players, So Why Is the National Team No Good?"" read the headline on an article on Sunday by the state-run China News Service.While the rules differ by league, the lineups of professional teams are mostly limited by checkbooks, not nationalities. Evergrande has three Brazilian attackers in its starting lineup, including the forward Elkeson, who scored the winning goal on Saturday.Some national teams rely on naturalized players. Against China, Hong Kong fielded players born in Cameroon, England, Ghana, Nigeria and mainland China. China, however, uses only homegrown players. An official in Wuhan has proposed lifting the restrictions that prevent foreign-born players from participating on the national team. But for many fans, such a solution would sidestep the question of why a nation of 1.4 billion, which has managed to dominate global competition in sports like badminton and diving, cannot do the same in soccer.While Evergrande has strong foreign talent, it also has a core of Chinese players, an indication that other problems are at play. Several commentators have argued that China's national team still suffers from unwieldy state-run management. It could benefit from the streamlined, ""capitalist"" model of Evergrande, they say, which is owned by a real estate company and the e-commerce giant Alibaba and this month became the first listed club in Asia.""Evergrande's ability to succeed confirms that if the government gets out of Chinese soccer and gives it over to the market and society, there will be quick results,"" the sports commentator Huang Jianxiang wrote. ""They don't only rely on money, but also the most professional skill levels and methods to improve their game.""President Xi Jinping of China has made no secret of his love for soccer. On a trip to England in October, he visited Manchester City's training ground and had a photo taken with the team's Argentine star, Sergio Agüero, and Prime Minister David Cameron. In March, China announced a plan to overhaul the sport, including increasing youth participation levels and moving the soccer federation from the national sports administration to give it more autonomy.Still, not everyone is confident that Evergrande's success will mean much to anyone besides Evergrande.""The national team is now under Uncle Xi's watch, and the main points of reform have come out, including removing the soccer federation from under the sports administration,"" said a column on the website of the Southern Media Group, based in Guangzhou. ""But what will the national side learn from Evergrande? That's still a question.""Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: Asian Morning newsletter.

"Trump, Saying He Heard Cheers on 9/11, Urges Surveillance of Some Mosques:   [National Desk ]",,"Donald J. Trump said Saturday that he would order surveillance of ""certain mosques"" to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks and claimed to have watched as ""thousands and thousands of people were cheering"" while the World Trade Center towers fell on Sept. 11, 2001.In a rally at the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex in Birmingham, Ala., Mr. Trump, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, dismissed accounts of his apparent support for creating a registry of Muslims in the United States as an effort by the news media to entrap him. He then seemed to clarify that idea on Saturday, saying he wanted a database of refugees entering the country from Syria and adding, to cheers, ""I want surveillance of certain mosques, O.K.?""""We've had it before and we'll have it again,"" he added. Mr. Trump has recently spoken of the New York Police Department's use of informants in mosques after the Sept. 11 attacks.It is unclear whether a database of Syrian refugees would be markedly different from the records already being kept in screening by federal agencies. But Mr. Trump, the leading Republican candidate in some polls, has been perhaps the most strident of all the contenders on the issue of whether to accept refugees after the Paris attacks, raising the possibility that some extremists could slip in among them and telling the crowd Saturday that should he win the presidency, the refugees are ""going back, we can't have them.""Earlier this year, Mr. Trump said that accepting a limited number of refugees from Syria was a humanitarian decision.Perhaps the most striking comment of the day was his recounting of the Sept. 11 attacks as he talked about the security landscape since the Paris massacre:""Hey, I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering. So something's going on. We've got to find out what it is.""It was not clear what Mr. Trump was referring to. There were cheers of support in some Middle Eastern countries that day, which were broadcast on television. But a persistent Internet rumor of Muslims celebrating in Paterson, N.J., was discounted by police officials at the time. A search of news accounts from that period shows no reports of mass cheering in Jersey City.Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the response of Muslim-Americans on Sept. 11 was disgust.""I know because I wrote it,"" he said of the council's reaction, adding that if Mr. Trump had evidence of cheering, he should present it.Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, would not elaborate on his comments; his aides have repeatedly declined to make him available to address the controversies over some of his statements. Ms. Hicks said only that Mr. Trump had drawn an ""unprecedented"" crowd of 10,000 in Birmingham, adding, ""Mr. Trump's speech was great and unbelievably well received.""Since the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris by Islamic extremists, which killed 130 people, the national mood has turned against admitting refugees from Syria, where the Islamic State has taken control of certain areas, a poll by Bloomberg Politics showed last week. And Mr. Trump has been riding a wave of anger and mistrust of government and politicians since he entered the race in June.Mr. Trump's calls for surveillance came after he said earlier in the week that he supported closing some mosques. He has not been alone in making such calls; a top donor to Hillary Rodham Clinton also urged such surveillance in the wake of the Paris attacks. The donor, Haim Saban, later said he had misspoken.The rest of Saturday's speech was a classic Trump performance, a crowd-pleasing stream of boasts, humor and mockery. Referring to George E. Pataki, the former New York governor who has been lagging badly in polls and was one of several opponents to seek airtime from NBC after Mr. Trump hosted the network's ""Saturday Night Live,"" he said: ""They could give him 12 'Saturday Night Lives,' an hour and a half a night -- not going to have any impact.""At one point during the rally, a protester whom Mr. Trump called to have ejected -- ""Get him the hell out of here,"" he ordered security guards -- was punched and kicked by some attendees, CNN reported.The protester, who wore a shirt saying ""Black Lives Matter"" and refused to leave the rally, was hit by roughly a half-dozen attendees, CNN said. The police told the network that the man had not required medical attention.Ms. Hicks did not respond to an email asking about the removal of the protester.Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.",0.0
"Elsinore, Like Hamlet, Comes Back to Life:   [Travel Desk ]",,"One afternoon last fall, I walked along the North Sea coast in search of a ghost.Admittedly, the bucolic spot felt incongruously cheerful for a paranormal encounter. A low sun splayed its rays over the blue water and the majestic red brick walls of the Renaissance castle next to me. Couples with ice cream strolled around the embankment and sea gulls floated above.No phantoms materialized. I was probably several centuries too late.For it was there, along the ramparts of Kronborg Castle, that Hamlet, prince of Denmark, encountered the ghost of his murdered father, setting in motion the revenge story that propels what is perhaps the most famous literary work in the English language.A devotee of ""Hamlet,"" I had taken the 45-minute train ride up the coast from Copenhagen to the town of Elsinore (called Helsingor in Denmark) to immerse myself in the Renaissance-era ""Elsinore"" Castle -- as Shakespeare called it -- and stroll among the town's centuries-old edifices.But I was also keen to witness Elsinore's recent renaissance. Though the town enjoyed centuries as a prosperous royal outpost (thanks mainly to taxes levied on foreign trade ships passing through the adjacent sound that separates Denmark from Sweden), its fortunes ebbed in the 1980s with the collapse of its shipbuilding industry. The docklands wasted away. The town's income became dependent on Swedish day-trippers, who would ferry over to buy cheap booze.The last five years, however, have seen an Elsinore resurgence. Following a major municipal effort, the town now has cutting-edge cultural venues, public artworks and cultural festivals to augment its time-honored appeal.From the train station, I threaded my way past churches with green copper spires and gabled, half-timbered houses in fanciful colors -- peach, mustard, sage -- toward the newest attraction, the M/S Maritime Museum of Denmark.Everywhere, the town flaunted its nautical past. Model ships and sailor hats peeked out from boutique windows. On a wall, a mural depicted a cartoonish vision of the harbor, replete with three-masted ships, buccaneers, sailors, fishmongers and spyglass-toting explorers.Things took a turn for the strange along the docks, where a giant fish had been assembled from colorful plastic flotsam and jetsam, like watering cans, dish racks, garden tools and children's toys. Nearby, a silvery boy sat on a silvery rock and stared forlornly out to sea. A male counterpart to the famous Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen, the highly polished stainless-steel statue of Han (""Him"" in Danish) was unveiled in 2012 by Elmgreen and Dragset, a contemporary art pair known for their sometimes provocative public art installations around the world.A descending gangplank-like walkway brought me into the museum, which traces the seafaring history of the Danes, from the Vikings to the Maersk global shipping empire. Opened in 2013, the subterranean space is built into the U-shaped perimeter of a disused dry dock where large ships were once serviced. The design comes courtesy of the Bjarke Ingels Group (a.k.a. BIG), an envelope-pushing young Danish architectural firm that has built an impressive international portfolio and racked up abundant awards.The result is an enveloping sensory experience, part nautical fun house and part time capsule. Ambling along uneven floors (which mimic being at sea) I was subsumed in cinematic music, colored lights, projected films and noises of boat horns and sea gulls. Display cases resembling old portholes and stacked chests revealed the accouterments of old-time shipboard journeys, from ""hardtack"" sailor biscuits to sextants and sundials.The interactive exhibits revealed something else: my unfitness for maritime life. In an ersatz old-world tattoo parlor, I stenciled the word Mor (Mother) on my forearm with a buzzing pen meant to mimic a needle. The shaky, amateurish result would have left any mother ashamed. In a soaring hall dedicated to contemporary global shipping, equipped with computer terminals and a huge projected map of seaborne transport lanes, my attempts to route a container ship from Australia to Bangladesh resulted in a half-million-dollar loss for my ""company.""Exposed as a landlubber, I consoled myself with fish and chips in the atrium-like restaurant of the Culture Yard next door. Formerly part of the town shipyard, the industrial building has been fully overhauled and outfitted with a jagged glass facade suggesting transparent origami. Today the building houses auditoriums, exhibition areas, a multimedia library and other spaces to host an annual roster of concerts, theater and cinema.That evening's entertainment was provided by bands participating in the fourth edition of the Knejpe Festival, a two-night gala held in Elsinore's numerous nautical-themed bars and old-world taverns. Valorizing sea shanties and world music -- Greek blues, Cuban folk, Afrobeat -- the event pays homage to Elsinore's past as an international port. (Another new event, the multimedia Click Festival, looks instead to the future, exploring ""the field between art, science and technology."")""We thought it would be a great way to tell the story of Elsinore as a maritime city,"" said Mikael Fock, the Knejpe Festival organizer, whom I chanced upon while waiting to enter a subterranean bar called Holger Danske. Throngs of revelers ambled unsteadily through the streets as musicians lugged instruments into various venues. ""There are at least 13 traditional bars left in Elsinore,"" Mr. Fock said.Within Holger Danske, a stony cavern, a gray-haired man and woman called Duo Visti worked a banjo and accordion, strumming and squeezing out minor-key Danish drinking songs while the boisterous crowds swallowed local Wiibroe lager.Down the street, a band called Klepti Klepti summoned rollicking Balkan Gypsy music that shook the walls of Hald An, a smoky tavern decorated with a faded seascape mural. Next up was My Bubba, three young Scandinavian women -- one Dane, one Swede, one Icelander -- in vintage-store dresses who merged their voices in high harmony while strumming and drumming jangly ditties.""Hundreds of years ago there were bars everywhere"" in Elsinore, said Kirsten Dalsgaard, a self-described regular of Kobenhavneren tavern, a cottage-like warren of small rooms decorated with beer steins and paintings. In a corner, Bolvaerket (wharf, in Danish), two middle-aged guys on guitar and bass, cranked out good-time rock. With the Knejpe Festival, she added, ""We are trying to relive it."">Eventually, all paths lead to the iconic Kronborg Castle, a sober, four-sided fortress bedecked with ornate spires and scrolled architectural flourishes, a curious marriage of Lutheran restraint and Renaissance pomp.An actor in period costume led my tour group through the castle rooms as he alternately narrated, re-enacted and provided background to ""Hamlet."" Assuming the role of Horatio, the prince's confidant, he shepherded us along the ramparts, into the cellars and through various stately rooms -- the royal chambers, the palace chapel, the immense ballroom -- while bringing the play's celebrated scenes to life.Afterward I chatted with the actor-guide, William Jansen, alongside the castle courtyard, where Elsinore holds its most famous festival every August. (This year's edition runs Aug. 1 to 9) A mix of performances, films and concerts, ""Shakespeare at Hamlet's Castle"" has drawn some of the modern era's most celebrated actors to play the title role. Laurence Olivier, Derek Jacobi, Richard Burton, Kenneth Branagh and Jude Law are among the many greats who have held Yorick's skull on that very spot.Next year, Mr. Jensen said, promises especially abundant rewards for the Shakespeare faithful. As the 400th anniversary of the playwright's death and the 200th year since ""Hamlet"" was first performed at Kronborg Castle -- by a group of soldiers -- the town is gearing up for a particularly extravagant and extensive homage.""It's going to be a grand occasion"" Mr. Jansen said. Then he strutted across the cobblestones to welcome another group and delve again into Elsinore's past.IF YOU GOGetting ThereSummer is perhaps the most popular season to visit, though spring and fall are also agreeable. Frequent northbound trains (rejseplanen.dk) from Copenhagen's Central Station make the roughly 45-minute journey to Elsinore. A one-way ticket is 108 Danish kroner (about $16 at 6.6 kroner to the dollar).Where to EatClose to the train station, Madam Sprunck is a 37-room hotel (Bramstrade 5) and the town's best restaurant. The timbered, candlelit dining room recently served a hearty fish soup, robust veal nuggets in wine sauce and apple mouse with apple-chile sorbet. A three-course meal for two, without drinks, is about 750kroner. Double rooms from 995 kroner. madamsprunck.dk.In addition to an exhibition center, library and concert venue, the avant-garde Culture Yard (Allegade 2; 45-49-28-37-70; kuto.dk.) houses a cafe-restaurant (open for breakfast and lunch) that serves fish and chips (89 kroner), above, flaeskesteg (roasted pork) sandwiches (95 kroner), Copenhagen microbrews and more.What to SeeInteractive displays on centuries of seafaring fill the M/S Maritime Museum of Denmark (Ny Kronborgvej 1; 45-49-21-06-85; mfs.dk; adults, 110 kroner).Shakespearean history lurks inside Kronborg Castle (45-49-21-30-78; kronborg.dk; admission, 90 kroner), a Unesco World Heritage site that can be visited solo or as part of a group tour, such as ""Introduction to Kronborg Castle"" (free with paid admission) and ""In Hamlet's Footsteps"" (50 kroner in addition to castle admission).FestivalsSpring brings the Click Festival (clickfestival.dk), devoted to multimedia creation in various forms.The long-running Hamletscenen, or Shakespeare Festival, at Hamlet's Castle (hamletscenen.dk), is a multiday August gala of Shakespearean concerts, films and performances, featuring a ""Hamlet"" production.Come fall, the Knejpe Festival (knejpe-festival.dk) of seafaring music fills traditional local bars like Hold-An (Bjergegade 20; 45-40-42-20-59) and Holger Danske (Stengade 68; 45-49-21-14-42; holgerdanske.info).Photograph Revitalized: Kronborg Castle, Top, Was the Setting for ""Hamlet.""

Taliban Pick New Chief and 2 Hard-Line Deputies:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan -- The Taliban leadership announced on Friday that the group's longtime deputy, Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, had been appointed its new supreme leader, and that his two deputies were drawn from its hard-line Haqqani wing, according to messages posted on a website associated with the group.The move greatly elevated the standing of the Haqqani network, which unlike the Taliban's main command is listed by the United States as a terrorist organization. That may also complicate efforts to resume peace talks, which were suspended after confirmation of the death of the Taliban's former leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar.It also threatened a serious split within the Taliban, with Mullah Omar's son, Mullah Yaqoub, at one point walking out of a meeting called to debate the appointment of Mullah Mansour as leader, according to Taliban officials with knowledge of the process. Mullah Yaqoub, who had sought the leadership himself, later publicly criticized the choice.Taliban officials with knowledge of the deliberations by the group's leadership council described several dramatic days of talks this week over choosing a successor, as it became clear to the insurgents that they would no longer be able to keep up the fiction that Mullah Omar was still alive. Notably, the decision was not delayed for deliberation by a larger council of Taliban members, which may hurt its legitimacy in the eyes of some.Initially, the powerful Haqqani network faction was said to be supporting Mullah Yaqoub, as was Mullah Abdul Qayuum Zakir, the Taliban's top military leader. The talks took on urgency as Afghan government officials announced on Wednesday that Mullah Omar died two years ago in a hospital in Pakistan. A day later the Taliban confirmed that he was dead, although without acknowledging when he died.If the new Taliban leadership remains in control, it will pose a dilemma for American policy makers, who have painstakingly tried to draw a sharp distinction between the mainstream Taliban, who were once in government, and the Haqqani faction.Now there would be little to distinguish the Taliban factions, with two powerful Haqqani figures sharing senior roles and the new leader, Mullah Mansour, apparently indebted to them for his position.The new leadership would also be likely to solidify the Pakistani military's strong influence over the Taliban's central command, as the Haqqanis have long enjoyed patronage and protection in Pakistan, and Mullah Mansour is also seen as being close to the Pakistani military and intelligence.The formal announcement of the decision by the leadership council of the Quetta Shura, the Taliban's governing body, was posted on the Taliban website, Shahamat, in English, Pashto and Dari on Friday. The announcement also said that the Taliban's two ""deputy heads"" would be Maulavi Haibatullah Akhunzada, the Taliban's former judiciary chief and a Haqqani network member, and Mullah Sirajuddin Haqqani, the leader of the Haqqani network and the son of its founder, Jalaluddin Haqqani.In an odd coincidence -- if that's what it was -- reports began filtering out on Friday that Jalaluddin Haqqani, who was in his 70s and had long been ill, might have also died in secrecy last year. Reached for comment, a member of the Haqqani network in Pakistan said that Mr. Haqqani had died in December, but the report could not be more widely confirmed.Jalaluddin Haqqani had directly pledged the loyalty of his group to Mullah Omar, but the network retained some autonomy. The group has been responsible for many of the most significant attacks in eastern Afghanistan and in Kabul, especially those targeting Americans.That has not made them opposed to talking peace with the United States. As the faction holding the American prisoner of war Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the Haqqanis were willing to cooperate in swapping him for Taliban prisoners held at Guantánamo Bay -- although American officials insisted that they were not negotiating directly with the Haqqanis but going through other Taliban officials.When the first round of official meetings between Taliban and Afghan government officials took place in Pakistan on July 7, one of the proposed Taliban negotiators was Yahya Haqqani, a brother-in-law of Sirajuddin Haqqani. American officials who were present as observers objected to Yahya, who has a $5 million American bounty for his capture on terrorism charges, and the Haqqanis dropped him from the delegation, according to Mohammad Asim, one of the Afghan delegates.Taliban officials with knowledge of the talks on a successor to Mullah Omar, said that initially, Mullah Zakir, the Taliban military leader, had joined with the Haqqanis in backing Mullah Yaqoub to replace his father as leader.Some Taliban officials saw that as a bid by Mullah Zakir to assume power through the younger Mullah Yaqoub, who is thought to be around 26. After Yaqoub and Zakir walked out to protest the selection of Mullah Mansour, the issue was pressing enough that the Taliban leadership discussed having a jirga, or a grand council meeting, to settle it and head off a schism.Within a day, however, the leadership council had made a deal to give the Haqqanis two posts as deputies, cementing Mullah Mansour as the new leader, the Taliban officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the group's internal politics.They soon persuaded Mullah Zakir to support the choice of Mullah Mansour, and were hopeful of doing the same with Mullah Yaqoub, one of the Taliban officials said. A statement was posted on the Taliban website in Mullah Zakir's name late Friday, saying he had no conflict with Mullah Mansour.""There is no longer any need for a 300-person jirga,"" one of the officials said. ""The family of Mullah Omar pledged its allegiance to Mansour.""However, on Friday, The Associated Press quoted Mullah Yaqoub as saying, ""I am against the decision to select Mullah Akhtar Mansour as leader."" He did not elaborate in the remarks quoted by the news agency.Another Taliban official said that Mullah Omar's brother, Abdul Mannan, had supported Mullah Mansour. ""The leadership council got his support, but Yaqoub was not present,"" the official said. ""Today we have heard that Zakir has been convinced, and if he is convinced, Yaqoub will also be convinced.""The Taliban statement said the new emir had been chosen in a meeting of the leadership council with ""scholars, saints and dignitaries of the Islamic Emirate,"" as it calls its organization. It did not say when the meeting took place, except that it was ""after his passing away,"" a reference to Mullah Omar.Mullah Mansour had officially been the deputy leader of the Taliban for about five years. He had also insisted to many lower-level commanders, despite their doubts, that Mullah Omar was still alive and he was acting on his behalf, raising the potential for hard feelings toward him.Mullah Mansour has supported engaging in peace talks with the Afghan government, but his appointment did not come in time for a scheduled second round of peace talks, which were due to be held in Pakistan on Friday, July 31, but were canceled after Mullah Omar's death became public this week.The Taliban statement said Mullah Mansour ""had been practically administrating the Islamic Emirate"" long before Mullah Omar's death. Another statement posted on the same website recently expressed vague support for peace talks in general, while criticizing foreign interference in them.Maulavi Qalamudin, a member of the Afghan government's High Peace Council and himself a former Taliban official, expressed doubt that the succession issue had been settled. ""It is still not confirmed how many Taliban have voted to replace Mullah Omar,"" he said. ""There is still a possibility of disputes between them; we will have to wait and see if those disputes will be resolved or not.""",0.0

Presidential Bid Is New for Trump; Racially Charged Talk Is Not:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. Under a dark photograph showing hypodermic needles and drug paraphernalia, the newspaper advertisement warned in dire terms that violent criminals were coming to town. ""Are these the new neighbors we want?"" the paid message asked. ""The St. Regis Mohawk Indian record of criminal activity is well documented.""The ad, part of an advocacy campaign meant to stop a casino from being built in New York's Catskill region, drew an indignant response from the tribe, which called it a naked appeal to racism. The incendiary ads, which ran in upstate newspapers in February 2000, were the work of the New York Institute for Law and Society, an opaque interest group that described itself as opposed to casino gambling.It was only later that the man who bankrolled the ads identified himself: Donald J. Trump.Long before Mr. Trump announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, roiling the 2016 election with his pugnacious style and speeches in which he has branded many undocumented immigrants as rapists and murderers, he had proved himself in New York as an expert political provocateur with an instinct for racially charged rhetoric.To communities that have clashed with Mr. Trump in the past, his current strategy is entirely familiar. The slash-and-burn offensive against casino gambling in New York was a revealing foray into local politics, but it was only one of several episodes that seem to foreshadow the tone of his presidential campaign.In 1989, amid a citywide panic in New York prompted by the assault of a white female jogger in Central Park, Mr. Trump ran advertising that called for a return of the death penalty.Later, during negotiations with the town of Palm Beach, Fla., his associates threatened through the media to sell a beachfront estate owned by Mr. Trump to the Unification Church, a Christian sect founded in South Korea and known for the practice of holding mass weddings.Mr. Trump acknowledged that his style can be offensive to some, but he defended it as essential for communicating his message.""It would be nice to be somewhat gentler,"" he said in an interview this week, ""but at the same time, I don't think I would be able to make the point nearly as well, whether it's the death penalty or other things, totally unrelated.""Mr. Trump said it was ""not my intention"" to speak in racially provocative terms, but expressed little interest in softening his language. ""It's very time-consuming to be politically correct,"" he said, ""and I don't like wasting a lot of time.""He has used divisive rhetoric to advance his business interests: His drive against the St. Regis Mohawks was intended to protect his investments in Atlantic City at the time, by blocking casino development in a competing market. Mr. Trump, who stood by the content of the newspaper and television ads he paid for, said he had made a ""tremendous amount of money in Atlantic City"" and did not want to see gamblers migrating elsewhere.""I wasn't knocking the Mohawks; I was knocking their record,"" Mr. Trump said. ""That's not because they're Mohawks. That's because their record is bad and was proved to be bad at the time.""The ads shocked local tribal leaders, who took out their own newspaper ad in response to denounce the ""racist and inflammatory rhetoric of this sham Institute.""""How dare they smear a nation and brand us all as criminals,"" the ad said.The anti-St. Regis ads drew the scrutiny of New York's lobbying commission, and Mr. Trump acknowledged that he was the New York Institute for Law and Society's primary sponsor. In a settlement with the state, he and his advisers agreed to pay a fine and run a set of ads apologizing, not for the content of the anti-Mohawk ads, but for evading state disclosure rules related to lobbying and political advocacy.The new ads expressed regret ""if anyone was misled concerning the production and funding of the lobbying effort,"" according to settlement documents obtained through a state records request.Rowena General, who was chief of staff for the St. Regis Mohawks in 2000, said Mr. Trump's ad campaign was a cynical attempt to use fear about race and crime to protect his business investments. The tenor of his presidential campaign, she said, was ""not surprising at all, considering our experience with him.""Eleven years earlier, Mr. Trump had financed what was perhaps an even more charged advertisement days after the brutal assault on the jogger in Central Park. The ad, in the form of an open letter from Mr. Trump, was topped with two sentences that blared: ""Bring Back the Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!""The message, which appeared in four publications, including The New York Times, channeled widespread anger and fear about violent crime. Invoking the image of ""roving bands of wild criminals"" wreaking havoc on the streets, Mr. Trump's letter rebuked Mayor Edward I. Koch, a Democrat who supported the death penalty, for urging New Yorkers not to turn to hate in the aftermath of the Central Park assault.""I want to hate these muggers and murderers,"" Mr. Trump wrote in the ad. ""They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes.""The rape and near-murder in Central Park rocked New York in the midst of the 1989 mayoral race, becoming a chilling symbol of a city seemingly out of control. Over time, it also came to represent the flaws in the criminal justice system. Five teenagers, four of them black, one Latino, were arrested and imprisoned for carrying out the attack. Known as the Central Park Five, they had their convictions vacated years later after another man, Matias Reyes, confessed to the crime.State Senator Bill Perkins, a Democrat who at the time was president of the tenants' association at Schomburg Plaza, the Manhattan apartment complex where several of the defendants lived, said he was horrified to see Mr. Trump emerge as a contender for the presidency. A framed copy of Mr. Trump's 1989 newspaper ad hangs in Mr. Perkins's Harlem office as a reminder, he said, of an ugly moment in the city's recent past.""This was taking a moment, a very unfortunate and one might say racially tense moment in our city, and fueling a lynch mob,"" Mr. Perkins, who is black, said of the ad. ""This is the Donald Trump that we have to remember as we pay attention to his ranting, his continuous ranting and carrying on.""Mr. Trump said that the ad was motivated purely by his support for reinstituting the death penalty and that it did not have a racial component. He said he remained a strong proponent of capital punishment and called it a necessary deterrent to violent crime.""This had nothing to do with race,"" he said. ""I have always been a big believer, and continue to be, of the death penalty for horrendous crime.""He added that he had no regrets about the ad, though he noted that because the victim of the assault had survived, the death penalty would not have been appropriate.New York City last year settled a lawsuit brought by the five defendants for $41 million, without acknowledging wrongdoing.Jonathan C. Moore, a lawyer who represents four of the men, said Mr. Trump had shown an ""incredible lack of judgment"" in the Central Park case. His clients, Mr. Moore said, had been in the park on the night of the attack but had committed no crime.""Donald Trump was an example of how, mostly white people, rushed to judgment about what happened there,"" said Mr. Moore, who is white. Describing the victim and her alleged attackers, he added, ""It was a young white investment banker, and all these young black kids who looked like they were guilty.""Even now, Mr. Trump refuses to completely back down. He criticized the city's settlement, arguing that the young men had been convicted by a jury and had probably been involved in some kind of criminal activity on the night of the assault.""They walked away with $41 million and the best thing they had going for them was they were wilding in other parts of the park, beating the hell out of people,"" Mr. Trump said, using a term, popularized after the Central Park assault, for young men going on a crime spree.Two years after running the ads about the Central Park case, Mr. Trump drew accusations of racism during a lobbying effort in Palm Beach, where he was seeking to subdivide the palatial estate known as Mar-a-Lago. As he faced considerable opposition from the town, articles appeared almost simultaneously in both The New York Post and The Palm Beach Daily News reporting, based on anonymous sources, that he might sell the property to the Unification Church.The church, which was founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon and viewed by many at the time as a cult, roundly denied any interest in the property and accused Mr. Trump of using the faith as a racial and religious cudgel against officials in the Florida town. Dr. James A. Baughman, who led the church's branch in the United States at the time, said then that the church had no interest in the property. Mr. Trump, he said, was using ""the Unification Church as a scare tactic in an attempt to compel Palm Beach officials to submit to the will of Mr. Trump.""The town ultimately rejected Mr. Trump's bid to subdivide the estate, and he converted it to a private club instead. He said this week that any suggestion the property would be sold to the Unification Church ""certainly wasn't intended"" to be racial in nature.Indeed, Mr. Trump sounded incredulous at the notion. ""That's Korean,"" he said of the church. ""So now I'm against the Koreans, too, you mean?""In the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump has discussed crime and immigration in explicitly alarmist terms. He has highlighted murders committed by undocumented immigrants, and has repeatedly referred to an undocumented Mexican immigrant who has been charged with killing a young woman in San Francisco as ""this animal.""The furor over his comments led NBC to sever its ties with him: He will no longer be associated with the ""Apprentice"" franchise, and NBC's parent, NBCUniversal, said the network would no longer carry the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, part of a joint venture with Mr. Trump.He said that there might be some value in speaking with greater restraint, but that that would exact its own price: ""I might not get my point across nearly as well.""""The interesting thing is,"" he said, ""I am probably the least racist person that you will ever speak to.""",0.0
Price Electrifies Toronto's Fans With Debut for Jays:   [Sports Desk ],,"TORONTO -- When the Toronto Blue Jays acquired David Price from the Detroit Tigers last week, the objective was both to add his pitching excellence and to capitalize on his vast experience. Price has pitched in the World Series, critical playoff games and even a win-and-get-in 163rd game two years ago.But even with all those memorable moments of pitching in high-stakes baseball in September and October -- games played in front of large television audiences and sold-out stadiums -- Price said his Blue Jays debut on Monday reached a new level.""That was the best atmosphere I've ever been in,"" Price said before listing the big stages on which he has performed. ""I've pitched in quite a few big games, but that atmosphere today, that takes the cake. I've never experienced anything like that. That was cool.""Price may be as good at hyperbole as he is at throwing a baseball, but there was no mistaking his contribution to one of the most eagerly awaited games here in a long time. Price struck out 11 over eight innings, allowing one run and three hits, in a 5-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins that bolstered the Blue Jays' playoff hopes -- at least in the eyes of their ecstatic fans, who roared with delight at almost everything Price did.Price retired the last 15 batters he faced, and the reconfigured Blue Jays won for the fifth time in their last six games. They tied Minnesota for the second wild-card spot in the American League and trail the first-place Yankees in the East by five and one-half games, a substantial deficit but not an insurmountable one.""It gives us another level of confidence,"" said Josh Donaldson, who hit a two-run home run. ""I think you are going to start seeing us play our better baseball of the year.""Price became the first Blue Jays pitcher to strike out 11 batters in a debut, surpassing the mark set by Roger Clemens, who struck out nine in 1997. Price also improved to 8-0 in 10 starts at Rogers Centre; he is 6-2 with a 3.52 earned run average at Yankee Stadium, the site of his next scheduled start, on Saturday.But that game is unlikely to surpass the energy and excitement that pulsated throughout Rogers Centre on Monday. With his parents and Kevin Durant joining 45,766 playoff-starved fans soaking up the sunshine underneath the open roof, Price put on a show befitting his status as resident ace.Price was traded July 30 for Daniel Norris, Jairo Labourt and Matt Boyd, three young left-handed pitchers, and his arrival has energized a fan base that has not seen a playoff game at home since 1993. One excited young boy fashioned a makeshift Price No. 14 jersey out of blue tape, and when Price saw a photo of it on Twitter, he found out the boy's identity and sent him a proper jersey.Before the game, Price walked through the Jays' clubhouse and saw catcher Russell Martin poring over recent film of Price in order to gain an insight into his new battery mate. Price, for his part, said he had long admired Martin's work behind the plate, especially setting targets and framing pitches for umpires.That familiarity and extra work paid off, as Martin and Price found a syncopation that mesmerized Twins hitters: The only damage came on a solo homer run by Torii Hunter in the second inning.""It went as smooth as it could have went,"" Price said, referring to working with Martin. ""I saw him sitting in the video room for probably 45 minutes to an hour just watching me pitch and just seeing what I like to do out there. He was spot on.""The high point came in the fourth inning when the Twins loaded the bases with nobody out. Martin went to the mound and told Price to worry only about the next batter. They would figure things out from there.Price induced a soft fly ball from Eddie Rosario that was chased down nicely in shallow center field by shortstop Troy Tulowitzki -- another recent addition to the Blue Jays. Tulowitzki turned and fired back to the infield to prevent a run from scoring.From his position backing up home plate, Price clapped along with the relieved fans, then proceeded to strike out Aaron Hicks. Then came Kurt Suzuki, who fell behind by 1-2 as the fans rose to their feet in anticipation of a strikeout.Price had been throwing most of his fastballs around 94 to 95 miles per hour, but at that point, with the score 1-1 and the outcome potentially in the balance, his arm found more juice.Suzuki fouled off a few pitches in the upper 90s, and then Price went back to the heater. He ramped it up to 97 and fired it up and away from Suzuki, who swung and missed.The fans erupted. Martin pumped his fist. Price pounded his left hand into his glove twice. The building almost seemed to quake. Minnesota never had another base runner, as Price set down five of his last 15 by strikeout and LaTroy Hawkins retired the final three.After the handshakes were done, the fans were still standing and cheering when Jays Manager John Gibbons went up to Price in front of the dugout and offered his analysis of a memorable day.""I just told him, 'Wow,' "" Gibbons said.Photograph David Price, a Playoff Veteran, Called Monday's Game ""the Best Atmosphere I've Ever Been In.""

Obama Begins His Own Push for Iran Pact:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- President Obama is rolling out a campaign of private entreaties and public advocacy over the next several weeks to build support in Congress for the nuclear deal with Iran, an effort to counter a well-financed onslaught from critics who have promised to use a monthlong congressional recess to pressure lawmakers to oppose the accord.In a speech at American University in Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Obama will seek to explain and defend the international agreement reached last month, which would lift some sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon.Mr. Obama, who campaigned for the presidency in 2008 promising to end wars in the Middle East, will use the speech to frame Congress's choice as the most consequential foreign policy decision since the vote to go to war in Iraq, and he will say the deal's opponents are the same people who supported that military conflict.""He will make the case that this should not even be a close call,"" a White House official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer a preview of Mr. Obama's message. The president will also say that it would be a ""historic mistake to squander this opportunity -- removing constraints on the Iranian program, unraveling the sanctions regime and damaging American credibility.""Anticipating a month of heavy lobbying and television advertising by opponents, led by the pro-Israel group Aipac, the president and members of his team are leaning on Democrats to declare their backing for the agreement before they leave Washington to face their constituents.Mr. Obama, who will decamp to Martha's Vineyard this weekend for his own two-week vacation, will have limited personal contact with wavering lawmakers, but his team has been instructed to make the president and other senior administration officials available to any skeptic with an unanswered question or concern about the deal. ""Anyone who wants a phone call will get one,"" one official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to outline internal strategy.Officials said that Mr. Obama's address on Wednesday would be followed by a series of news media interviews that would be shown next week. And the administration plans to dispatch cabinet members, including Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, the nuclear physicist who helped negotiate the accord, to travel the country outlining its provisions. Mr. Moniz will appear on Friday at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, officials said.""We are confident that a sizable number of members of Congress will put politics aside and focus on what they believe is in the best interest of the United States and our national security, and if they do, a substantial number of those who follow that path will be supportive of the agreement,"" said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. ""There's no denying that there is intense political pressure on both sides of this agreement,"" he continued, adding that officials were hoping that lawmakers would ""focus on the specific terms of the agreement.""The effort gained some momentum Tuesday as three closely watched Democratic senators -- Barbara Boxer of California, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Bill Nelson of Florida -- declared their backing, along with a handful of House Democrats. Mr. Obama's team is working with Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, to build support to potentially sustain a presidential veto of legislation rejecting the accord.But some prominent voices, including Representative Steve Israel of New York, the highest-ranking Jewish Democrat in the House; Nita Lowey, also of New York; and Ted Deutch of Florida came out against the agreement.""After a decade in public life working to stop Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons, I cannot support a deal giving Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief -- in return for letting it maintain an advanced nuclear program and the infrastructure of a threshold nuclear state,"" Mr. Deutch, the senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle East, wrote in The Sun Sentinel.Congress, which will return from its break Sept. 8, has until Sept. 17 to vote on a resolution supporting or rejecting the accord.Public opinion on the agreement has been in flux in recent weeks, with some polls indicating majorities or pluralities supporting it and others showing more opposition. J Street, a pro-Israel group that supports the deal and has announced a $2 million advertising campaign, found that a majority of American Jews supported the agreement.But Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who is a consultant to Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran, an Aipac-funded group that is planning to spend more than $25 million on advertising in the coming weeks, said that the more people knew about the deal, ""the more likely they are to disapprove of it.""""The intensity is clearly on the opposition side,"" he added.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel told thousands of American Jews in a webcast that the agreement was fatally flawed and dangerous, charging that proponents were trying to muzzle criticism of it with deceitful claims. ""As a result of this deal, there will be more terrorism, there will be more attacks, and more people will die,"" Mr. Netanyahu said.He also angrily rejected Mr. Obama's claims about the accord, particularly his argument that its opponents have no alternative other than war for reining in Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions, calling it ""utterly false.""Mr. Netanyahu's latest plea to American Jews came as Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met privately at the White House with about 20 leaders of Jewish groups to try to allay concerns about the deal, the first such session since the pact was completed.During a meeting in the Cabinet Room that lasted more than two hours, some of the leaders criticized Mr. Obama for portraying opponents of the deal ""basically as warmongers,"" one attendee said. The president said he would ""be very careful about it,"" but added that he would not hesitate to argue forcefully for the agreement, which he sees as being in the best interest of both the United States and Israel.The White House also posted a copy of the 159-page agreement on the website Medium, annotated with comments from Secretary of State John Kerry, Mr. Moniz and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. ""It's important that everyone understands exactly what's in this deal and how it'll work,"" the White House said in a preface to the post.",0.0
"Midcentury Chic at Loosie Rouge, in Williamsburg's South Side:   [Style Desk ]",,"For longtime Williamsburg denizens, the area's North Side now feels like a grim ""Mad Max"" wasteland patrolled by clean-cut conquistadors in hipster Halloween costumes. Seeking cooler climes, the neighborhood's holdouts now huddle in a South Side oasis along Broadway, just south of the Williamsburg Bridge, where new spots like Loosie Rouge have cropped up around the stately century-old street.With its windows cast open to the street on a toasty Saturday night, Loosie Rouge lured night crawlers coming from dinner at Diner or gassing up for a show at Baby's All Right. Talk was of the Governor's Ball and Bushwick Open Studios earlier that day, with the words ""amazing"" and ""nightmare"" being used almost interchangeably.The PlaceJust south of the Williamsburg Bridge, where passing J trains, cast-iron lofts and sooty brick-stack buildings provide unimpeachable old New York atmospherics. The apartment-size bar's magic-hour glow and midcentury Scandinavian décor will make you curse your own digs, and add up to an inviting je ne sais quoi. ""I really like it,"" Uma Madan, a Brooklyn-based beauty writer said on a recent night. ""It feels so Euro,"" she added, before conceding that she'd never actually visited the continent.The CrowdNearly all the guests are chugging into their 30s and look dressed for an al fresco dinner party in Tulum, with men in botanical-print Hawaiian shirts and women in witchy blacks and geometric jewelry. Early evenings are serene, as fledgling couples flirt and wingmates scheme. After 11 p.m., a thirstier set rolls in, clamoring for cocktails at the bar and perhaps a reason to pocket one of the sleepover toothbrushes Loosie Rouge provides in its loo.PlaylistOne recent weeknight, Cypress Hill triggered pot flashbacks.

A Hacking Epidemic That Hits Few Consumers in the Wallet:   [Money and Business/Financial Desk ],,"At Target, 40 million customers had their credit card information exposed to hackers. At JPMorgan Chase, personal details associated with 80 million accounts were leaked. Last month, a hacker gained access to 4.5 million records from the University of California, Los Angeles, health system.Enormous numbers like these can make it feel as if we're living through an epidemic of data breaches, in which no one's bank account or credit card is safe. But the actual effect on consumers is quite different from what the headlines suggest. Only a tiny number of people exposed by leaks end up paying any costs, and for the rare victims who do, the average cost has actually been falling steadily.How could that be? For starters, several laws protect consumers from bearing almost any financial losses related to hackers (though not the headaches of having to enter new credit card numbers into Amazon and elsewhere). Instead, banks and merchants, like Target, must bear the cost. But even their losses have been dropping in recent years, as data security experts have learned new strategies to prevent intrusions from turning into theft.""The bad guys are getting good,"" said David Robertson, the publisher of The Nilson Report, a data provider for the card industry, ""and the good guys are getting even better.""It's true that data breaches, particularly those in which Social Security numbers are compromised, can lead to a more devastating sort of identity theft, in which criminals open new financial accounts in a person's name and do damage that can take years and a lot of work to clean up. But consumers are almost never on the hook for financial losses in these sorts of episodes, which, by the way, have also been on the decline.This relatively sanguine picture of the impact of data breaches is an example of a threat that looks worse than it turns out to be. The sheer size of hackings shocks and startles when the attacks are first reported, but it's rare that journalists check on the actual consequences.Moreover, consumer fears can be stoked by the incentives of the people providing the data. Many of the statistics on identity fraud and online attacks come from security firms that want more people to buy their services. It's not so different from the soap company that advertises how many different types of bacteria are on a subway pole without mentioning how unlikely it is that any of those bacteria would make you sick.One of the most memorable statistics on identity fraud comes from advertisements that say a new victim is created every two seconds. That figure, which comes from Javelin Strategy and Research, is largely attributable to standard credit card fraud, in which criminals use a stolen credit card number to buy goods -- not the sort of thing most people imagine when they think of identity fraud. The more troubling identity theft, in which new accounts are opened in an unsuspecting person's name, make up only 5 percent of the total figure given by Javelin.These statistics do not mean that data security is not a real issue for authorities and consumers to think about. Even if the hackers don't use your credit cards, there are instances in which leaked data of other kinds can be damaging in itself, as was clear in the recent episodes at Sony Pictures and Ashley Madison, the website that connects prospective adulterers. There are also serious geopolitical concerns about foreign hackers compromising national security if they get a hold of military maps or staff lists from the C.I.A.For the companies and banks that bear the cost of stolen credit card numbers, the expenses are very real. Criminals racked up $7.8 billion in fraudulent purchases last year, with banks paying 62 percent of that amount and merchants the rest, according to The Nilson Report.The banks, though, have managed to curtail their costs as they have devised new methods to detect fraudulent purchases. The most prevalent strategy involves looking for patterns in card purchases, but some banks have even taken to buying stolen cards on the black market to identify breaches, security experts say.In the aftermath of the Target breach, in late 2013, the American Bankers Association said that the biggest expense for the banks was not the fraud but rather the cost of reissuing the cards and dealing with concerned customers.For JPMorgan, the costs after the 2014 intrusion were much more limited because the attackers took only email addresses and phone numbers, the type of information that is not hard to attain through other, legal channels.Consumer advocates generally say that the most important thing to pay attention to after a data breach is the type of information stolen. Karen Barney, a program director at the Identity Theft Resource Center, said that to commit true identity theft, hackers generally need to get a hold of Social Security numbers.""Social Security numbers are the be-all and end-all for successful attempts at identity theft,"" Ms. Barney said.While those nine-digit identifiers weren't made vulnerable in any of the big data leaks at retailers, they were exposed in this month's intrusion at U.C.L.A.'s health system and in the recent break-in at the federal government's Office of Personnel Management.To prevent fraud in the first place, banks are currently introducing cards with so-called E.M.V. chips, which make counterfeiting cards -- currently the most prevalent sort of fraud -- much more difficult.Though serious identity theft has been on the decline in recent years, many security experts are expecting that to change as dedicated criminals, whose easy counterfeiting is foiled by E.M.V. chips, start to focus on getting Social Security numbers and other data that enables them to open new accounts, said Mr. Robertson, of The Nilson Report.""For the bad guys, your five-year growth plan is not data breaches and stealing credit cards,"" Mr. Robertson said. ""It involves stealing all the info you can and opening legitimate accounts in people's names.""Ultimately, the problem will still require businesses, and individuals, to stop the thefts from happening in the first place.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

Judge Delays Man's Retrial in Patz Case Until Feb. 22:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"A judge on Monday delayed the retrial of a man accused of murdering Etan Patz until Feb. 22 to give a newly appointed prosecutor more time to prepare in one of the country's most infamous child-abduction cases.Justice Maxwell Wiley set the new date at a heated hearing, during which the lead prosecutor, Joel J. Seidemann, asked the court to impose an order of silence on defense lawyers, arguing that statements outside court to reporters might influence jurors.Mr. Seidemann said a court order was necessary because the lead defense lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, had briefed reporters outside court almost every day of the first trial, which ended in May with a hung jury. ""The last thing we would want in this case is for someone to read something said to a reporter in a hallway,"" he said.Mr. Fishbein shot back that he had spoken to reporters only to counter adverse publicity about his client coming from other sources, which is allowed under the American Bar Association's professional rules of conduct. ""There is no reason for a gag order here,"" he said.Justice Wiley said he also saw no need for a formal order. ""Everyone knows the rules, and we will abide by them,"" he said, eyeing both sides.Pedro Hernandez, 54, of Maple Shade, N.J., is accused of kidnapping and strangling Etan on May 25, 1979. That day, Etan, who was 6, disappeared while walking from his parents' loft in SoHo to a school bus stop two blocks away. At the time, Mr. Hernandez was a clerk in a bodega next to the bus stop, at West Broadway and Prince Street.Thirty-three years later, Mr. Hernandez was arrested on a tip from one of his relatives. After a long interrogation, he gave a confession to the police, later repeating it to a prosecutor.He said he lured Etan into the bodega basement with a soda and strangled him. He left the body, he said, in a box with some trash in a subterranean passageway a block and a half away. Etan's remains were never found. There was no physical evidence linking Mr. Hernandez to the crime.Mr. Hernandez's lawyers contend the confession is a fiction, the invention of a man with a low intelligence score and a personality disorder that clouds his ability to tell reality from fantasy.Mr. Seidemann, a senior trial counsel with years of experience in homicide cases, took over the prosecution from Joan Illuzzi in June, after she resigned to run for Staten Island district attorney.Mr. Fishbein opposed Justice Wiley's decision to put off the start of the new trial until February. Raising his voice, he pointed out that Mr. Hernandez had been in jail for four years, and, while Mr. Seidemann was just assigned to the case, two other prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office assisted Ms. Illuzzi in the first trial and could easily take over.But Judge Wiley said Mr. Seidemann's request for more time was reasonable. The records in the case stretch back 36 years and are voluminous, he said.""Mr. Seidemann is lead counsel,"" the judge said. ""He has to know what he's doing.""Since the hung jury was declared on May 8, even former jurors have stepped into the spotlight. The lone holdout for acquittal gave several interviews, defending his stance. Seven jurors who had voted to convict held a memorial service for Etan this year on the anniversary of his disappearance, and some of them have shown up for Mr. Hernandez's court appearances.On Monday, three of the pro-guilty jurors sat in court next to Etan's father, Stanley Patz, talking to him about the trial. Later, they said they were there to support the new prosecutor, with whom they met privately after the hearing. ""This has become part of our lives now,"" one ex-juror, Joan Brooks, said.",0.0
Head of Nonesuch to Step Down:   [Brief ],,"When executives at big record companies leave their jobs, there is usually a quick announcement and a scramble behind the scenes to install a new regime. Not so with the long sunset for Robert Hurwitz of Nonesuch Records, the prestigious Warner Music imprint that is home to acts as varied as Steve Reich, Laurie Anderson and the Black Keys.Warner will announce this week that Mr. Hurwitz, 66, who has been Nonesuch's president since 1984, will step down at the end of next year as part of a gradual leadership change. Starting in 2017, Mr. Hurwitz will become the label's chairman emeritus and continue to work as executive producer on 10 to 12 albums a year.""When I proposed all of this to the people that run Warner, we found a way to create a real transition,"" Mr. Hurwitz said in an interview. ""Nonesuch is too important to have it just go from day to day.""Nonesuch, founded in 1964 as a budget classical branch of Elektra Records, holds an unusual position in the record business both for its diverse catalog and for the stability of its management. The label's roster bridges classical, jazz, world and adult-oriented pop. Its most recent releases include work by the Kronos Quartet, the singer-songwriter Lianne La Havas and the jazz players Joshua Redman and the Bad Plus -- and over the years it has scored huge if unlikely hits like ""Buena Vista Social Club"" and Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No. 3.""For the past three decades, Bob's vision, intelligence and impeccable taste have driven Nonesuch to an incomparable level of musical artistry and distinction,"" Steve Cooper, chief executive of the Warner Music Group, said in a statement. ""In typical unorthodox fashion, rather than retiring, Bob has chosen a less-well-beaten path for the years ahead.""Among the activities Mr. Hurwitz said he would pursue in the future were tending to some 15,000 pages of his journals documenting, he said, ""every day of the last 30 years at Nonesuch,"" and going through a correspondence of hundreds of letters with musicians. Among the first artists Mr. Hurwitz signed were the composers John Adams and Mr. Reich, both of whom remain with the label. Mr. Reich and Philip Glass's onstage reunion was among the highlights of a three-week festival last season at the Brooklyn Academy of Music celebrating Nonesuch's 50th anniversary.""A lot of people have been around a lot of great artists,"" Mr. Hurwitz said. ""But I don't know of a lot of people who have been around the range of artists in all those different genres that I've been around.""Warner has not announced a replacement for Mr. Hurwitz, but a likely candidate is said to be David Bither, the label's senior vice president, who has been with Nonesuch since 1995 and was instrumental in signing acts like Wilco, Robert Plant, Youssou N'Dour and the Black Keys.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",0.0
Convenient Myth: A Living Taliban Chief:   [News Analysis ],,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- The Taliban, it turns out, had been sending the world messages from a dead man. And the world kept answering him.It continued until last month, when the Taliban issued a statement in the name of their supreme leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, intended to ""elucidate some issues about the previous and present ongoing jihadi struggle."" In it, Mullah Omar seemed open to the idea of peace negotiations, raising hopes in Kabul.The reclusive Mullah Omar, of course, had not been seen in public in nearly 14 years, and some of his commanders, having last heard from him around 2008 or 2009, had been demanding proof of life.Mullah Omar, according to the Afghan spy service and some Taliban officials, had already been dead for more than two years -- as many Afghan officials strongly suspected.Still, President Ashraf Ghani, who had gone all out for months to open talks with the Taliban, said before news cameras that he was encouraged by Mullah Omar's latest words, characterizing him as having said that ""negotiation is the solution.""For every major player in the Afghan war -- the Afghan government, the Taliban, the United States and Pakistan -- Mullah Omar and the unity his name imposed on the Afghan insurgency became convenient in some way, either politically or militarily.How the insurgent leader's death remained a secret for so long is a striking phenomenon that illuminates some of the murkier dynamics of the war in Afghanistan.For the Taliban, news of Mullah Omar's death risked fracturing an insurgency that has not just held together, but grown over a decade. No successor was likely to be as unifying in life as Mullah Omar proved to be even in death.His name, and his rank -- emir of the faithful -- became a kind of talisman against defection to competing groups. When some Taliban-allied commanders finally began jumping ship this past year, some to pledge loyalty to the Islamic State, they cited growing evidence of Mullah Omar's death as the reason.Mullah Omar's deputies drew much of their authority from their association, real or perceived, with the cleric, who the Afghan spy service said died in a Pakistani hospital in April 2013.So until last month, the Taliban continued to issue in Mullah Omar's name intermittent statements, marking holidays, bolstering morale and excoriating the government in Kabul and foreign invaders.The more complicated part is that Afghan, American and European officials largely went along, even though many privately acknowledged that Mullah Omar, alive or dead, was completely emeritus.Back in January, after the official end of the NATO combat mission in Afghanistan, the Pentagon hinted that Mullah Omar possibly remained a dangerous enemy. ""To the degree he is still targeting our Afghan allies and U.S. troops, yes, he remains a threat,"" the Pentagon's press secretary said.Diplomats made talking about Mullah Omar a kind of parlor game, compulsively discussing the latest official statements.""If you had never gotten confirmation that Mullah Omar had died, this would have gone on until he was 110,"" said the European Union's representative to Afghanistan, Franz-Michael Mellbin. ""When they would say 'Mullah Omar issued this statement,' I would say, 'No, he didn't; he's not around.' That's been my line.""Some Afghans wondered why the Taliban's enemies seemed willing to keep breathing life into Mullah Omar.""America especially should have undermined the notion that Mullah Omar was alive,"" said Hajji Atta Mohammad Ahmadi, the head of Kandahar's peace council. He said this would have helped uncover who actually led the Taliban, important information to ""conduct peace talks from the standpoint of reliable knowledge.""Yet for officials seeking peace negotiations, which are central to the long-term American hopes for Afghanistan, it was preferable that the insurgency possessed a clear hierarchy that could choose negotiators and decide terms. With Mullah Omar's myth intact, the Taliban possessed that.Moreover, any Taliban statements that sounded remotely like a peace overture were usually said to have Mullah Omar's imprimatur. There was the time Mullah Omar was said to have sanctioned the opening of a political office in Qatar. And this year, Mullah Omar's name was invoked during a nascent peace process, which stalled when his death was acknowledged last week.""It doesn't make sense to undermine a leader who sounds as though he is coming around to the idea of peace,"" a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group in Kabul, Graeme Smith, said, offering an explanation for why diplomats might have gone along with treating Mullah Omar as alive and relevant.Pakistani officials have also invoked Mullah Omar's name. As Pakistani officials told Afghanistan in recent months that they would try to get a Taliban delegation to meet with the Afghan government, the Pakistanis, perhaps to lower expectations, added a caveat: It depended on Mullah Omar's blessing, two Afghan officials familiar with the discussions said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomacy.Pakistani officials deny that Mullah Omar ever lived in their country. But American and some, though not all, Afghan officials claim he had been living there for years. If it is true that Mullah Omar died in a Karachi-area hospital two years ago, it seems unlikely that Pakistani security officials would not have known he was dead even when they were evoking his name in the peace process.Again, the myth of an engaged Mullah Omar proved handy. It bolstered Pakistan's public argument that the Afghan Taliban were autonomous, even while the Pakistani security forces kept themselves at the center of the peace talks by pressuring senior Taliban members to take part.Some Western officials suggest that Mullah Omar's myth became somewhat comfortable for a few reasons. No one knew what might come after. And over the course of a long war it helped obscure a discomfiting truth: The identities and motives of the insurgents, and their various factions, often remained opaque.At times, the idea of Mullah Omar helped keep ""hidden a simple truth that we don't really know what's going on or who we're fighting on any given day, and who their backers are,"" a Western official in Kabul said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering colleagues.Underlying it all, too, was the difficulty of getting reliable intelligence on a man who, even when known to be alive, had cloaked himself in a calculated unapproachability.""It was not out of convenience so much as the fact that while there wasn't hard evidence he was alive, there certainly wasn't any he was dead,"" said James F. Dobbins, who was the State Department's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2013 and 2014. ""We wondered, but in the absence of any evidence that he passed away, we simply operated under the assumption that he might still be living.""Mr. Dobbins was not surprised at how little was ever learned about Mullah Omar's whereabouts.""Look how long it took us to find Bin Laden, and we were looking a lot harder for him,"" said Mr. Dobbins, who is now at the RAND Corporation. Asked why the search for Mullah Omar had not taken on greater urgency, Mr. Dobbins replied, ""I guess the answer is: What difference would it have made?""He added, ""Whether he was alive or not, the Taliban was operating in a coherent, unified fashion in his name.""All that raises the question: If the United States government had learned of Mullah Omar's death, would it have acknowledged it?""We would have had to decide whether to announce it or not,"" Mr. Dobbins said. ""We never faced that.""",0.0
Police Step Up Terror Battle in New York:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"In January, several days after heavily armed terrorists attacked Charlie Hebdo, a satirical newspaper in Paris, top officials with the New York Police Department held a drill to test the city's response to such an attack and found they had a problem.As officers converged on 42nd Street in Manhattan near the United Nations headquarters, some took nearly an hour to get there. Others coming from plainclothes organized-crime and narcotics units in far-flung precincts in Brooklyn and Queens, did not look the part: street clothes, facial hair, semiautomatic weapons that did not match those being carried by colleagues in uniform.""One of the observers said they look a little too much like the bad guys,"" John J. Miller, the deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, said, describing the drill.Out of that moment came the formation of a standing counterterrorism force whose initial platoon of 100 officers rolled out on Monday and whose ranks will swell to 527 officers by the end of the year, much bigger than any of the ad-hoc units that the department has deployed in the years since the Sept. 11 attacks. The new unit, composed of experienced officers, was made possible in part by an expansion of the overall head count in the department this year.The timing, three days after the devastating attacks on Paris by teams of terrorists from the Islamic State, was coincidental. But it highlighted the message that New York police officers were going on ""offense and defense"" in response to terrorism threats, as the police commissioner, William J. Bratton, has said in a series of interviews and speeches over the last week.The story of how the new unit, known as the Critical Response Command, came into being traces the history of the city's evolving approach to terrorism, from the creation of the counterterrorism and intelligence divisions in the months after the attacks of 2001, to 2004, when the Police Department began pulling precinct officers into counterterrorism details, to the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, when officials realized they needed more firepower and officers trained to respond to multiple, simultaneous attacks.The attacks in Paris last week, officials said, validated their idea that a permanent force -- one that could be rapidly dispatched with the appropriate armor and weaponry -- was needed to counter heavily armed assailants.But even as the Police Department augments its ability to defend targets and respond to an attack, Mr. Bratton and other law enforcement leaders have complained that the emergence of technological hurdles is hampering the digital surveillance of terrorism suspects, as well as stymying the prosecutions of scores of criminal cases.""We, in many respects, have gone blind,"" Mr. Bratton said on Sunday, referring to apps that encrypt messages and smartphones that are inaccessible even with a search warrant.His comments, and those of James B. Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in New York on Wednesday, revived a longstanding debate between law enforcement officials and technology companies, one that had appeared settled last month when the Obama administration opted not to champion legislation requiring access to encrypted communications.The twin messages -- of a city better defended than ever, of intelligence capabilities hamstrung by ""misguided efforts"" by Silicon Valley companies, in the words of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. -- showed the pressure felt by police officials as New Yorkers go warily through their routines following the attacks in Paris last week.""I talked to a woman who works at a doctor's office this morning, and she knows what I do, and she says, 'I have to ask you, is it O.K. to ride the subway?' "" said Chief James R. Waters, the head of the department's Counterterrorism Bureau since 2008.""And I said to her, 'Absolutely it is,' "" the chief said. ""It happened in Paris, could it happen in New York? And short answer is yes. The long answer is, we are, in the New York Police Department, we are the most well-prepared police department in the country, if not the world.""On Friday, Mr. Bratton made a public show of riding the subway in Manhattan to allay concerns.With the new unit, Chief Waters's bureau has ballooned this year in size and in equipment, with new cars fitted to hold Colt M4 semiautomatic assault rifles. He said the attacks last week had accelerated the pace of procuring equipment and training officers in counterterrorism tactics, including courses that include undercover ""hostile surveillance"" to detect those who might be gathering information about potential targets, and the use of new devices.At the Police Academy on Thursday, a class of about 120 officers listened to instructions on terrorism threats as well as how to use ""personal radiation devices"" to detect potential hazards. The training lecture for the new unit included discussion of the four types of radiation -- alpha, beta, gamma, neutron -- as well as more practical information, such as the possibility that a person, or even a cat, could trip the device after a medical procedure.In addition to the Critical Response Command, the department recently created a citywide unit of roughly 700 patrol officers -- the Strategic Response Group -- who are also trained to use and are outfitted with semiautomatic rifles. The weaponry represents a marked escalation in the arming of the department. Whereas in the past, only the Emergency Services Unit had assault riles in their vehicles, the department is in the process of roughly tripling the number of high-powered rifles at the ready in patrol cars to ensure that every officer trained to use them has quick access to them.""It's a big change in the department,"" said Chief Waters, who compared it to a decision in 1990 to upgrade the weapon given to the city's transit officers, from revolvers to semiautomatic handguns. ""There was a clear need to move to the next level.""The fear, for some city officials as well as for Mr. Comey, is that as officers gear up for the next attack, the job of preventing it has grown harder -- the ""offense"" part of Mr. Bratton's message. That is because the people who might be planning an attack have disappeared from digital sight behind a wall of encrypted communications.""At that moment, the needle we have been searching the entire nation to find, and have found, goes invisible to us,"" Mr. Comey said in New York on Wednesday, describing how Islamic State fighters move their potential recruits from conversations on Twitter to encrypted apps.However, the White House in October concluded that any ""back door"" that would allow law enforcement access to encrypted data would also create an opening that those same terrorists, as well as cybercriminals, foreign governments and others, could exploit.""People shouldn't equate encryption with terrorism,"" said Stephen Schulhofer, a professor at the New York University School of Law who has written on the Fourth Amendment in the digital age. ""Terrorists may encrypt their messages, but not everybody who encrypts their messages is a terrorist. The ratio is probably two billion to one.""With avenues for electronic surveillance closing, according to officials, the Police Department will be pressed to develop better sources on the ground in communities around the city.""It absolutely stresses the capability for the intelligence agencies,"" said Mitchell D. Silber, a former director of intelligence analysis for the Police Department. ""It puts more of a premium on human intel.""But offsetting digital surveillance with so-called human intelligence gathering presents particular challenges in the city, where the Police Department's actions in Muslim communities have been challenged in federal court. Mayor Bill de Blasio last year announced the formal end to what had been known as the Demographics Unit, made up of detectives given the task of mapping populations in Muslim neighborhoods. Critics contend that while the name has changed, the tactics have not.""We have no evidence that they've ended the suspicionless surveillance against Muslim communities, which is at the heart of the lawsuit,"" said Baher Azmy, the legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, which is representing plaintiffs in a suit over the Police Department's surveillance of Muslims in New Jersey.Mr. Bratton, speaking to reporters on Tuesday, bristled at the mention of the Demographics Unit, which he said had been irrelevant to the department's intelligence efforts and had gone dormant by the time he returned as commissioner last year.""We have many other ways that we gather intelligence in the department,"" he said. ""There is an ability to keep a thumb on the pulse of what's going on out there."" For example, he said, detectives conduct surveillance in active investigations, and the department is building relationships with Muslims across the city.The trouble, according to counterterrorism experts, is that the perception of discriminatory practices by the Police Department in Muslim communities reduces the willingness of many to work with officers in rooting out potential terrorism threats.The new Critical Response officers, who will roam the city, anywhere from Times Square to Main Street in Flushing, Queens, appearing in different configurations and at different times of day, act as a deterrent to would-be attackers, officials said, and a kind of standing force ready to race to the scene of a strike in minutes.""After Charlie Hebdo, I said, 'Let's drill this,' "" said Mr. Miller, the deputy commissioner.At the time, the Police Department was relying on a first layer of protection -- about 100 patrol officers borrowed for the day from each precinct to go to potential targets -- and a second layer of response in the form of officers from the Organized Crime Control Bureau, who were trained after the Mumbai attack to use semiautomatic rifles. But those officers did not keep the weapons close at hand in their day-to-day work, which includes plainclothes operations in which some officers seek to blend into their surroundings. Mobilizing and equipping them at a moment's notice took time, the department found.""Do they have the guns with them? No, the guns are back at the office. Are the guns loaded? No,"" Mr. Miller said. ""The test we ran, it was suboptimal.""The department has, over the last year, ""double or tripled our ability to respond to a situation where there are multiple locations, multiple shooters,"" he said.""Those minutes,"" he continued, ""are critical.""Photograph Members of the Critical Response Command, a New Counterterrorism Unit in the Police Department.

"Garbage Collection, With No Noise or Smell:   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"In New York, the sound of trash may be as familiar as its smell.The booming thunder of an 18-ton garbage truck rumbling down the city's rutted roads. The screeching hum of the compactor, the pops and crackles of the refuse within. The honk, honk, hooooooonk of traffic backing up behind it.On Roosevelt Island, the sonics of garbage are the jet-engine roar of a 1,000-horsepower vacuum buried within the bowels of this two-mile spit of land. Not that most residents would know it. All they hear are birds chirping, joggers panting and water rippling in the East River as pneumatic tubes buried beneath their feet do the dirty work, silently sucking garbage from their buildings at 60 miles per hour.This invisible garbage has other benefits, too, especially at this time of year.""It's nice to walk out your door, and it doesn't smell like a heaping pile of trash, like in Manhattan,"" Abbie Kulhowvick, a former Upper East Side resident, said as she walked home from work last week.Roosevelt Island was envisioned with full 1970s zeal as a utopian place with affordable if somewhat Soviet-style housing in a car-free landscape. While vehicles still found their way onto the island, garbage trucks were largely banished, thanks to the pneumatic tube system, one of the largest in the world. It sucks up roughly 10 tons of trash from the island's 12,000 residents each day.And this ravenous behemoth is only growing.Last month, Riverwalk Point opened. The 266-unit apartment building is about as tall -- and the same striking red -- as the smokestacks of the Ravenswood power plant across the river in Long Island City, Queens. It is the seventh Riverwalk tower to be built at the foot of the tram over the past decade. Two more are planned, bringing the total number of apartment buildings on Roosevelt Island to 25.For Roosevelt Island residents, using the Automatic Vacuum Assisted Collections System, known as Avacs, is as simple as taking out the trash. After they drop garbage down chutes in their buildings, it collects at the bottom until a trapdoor is activated, releasing the waste into 22-inch-wide red steel tubes that run underground.Roughly five times a day -- fewer in the summer, more on holidays -- Department of Sanitation employees flip switches to pull garbage into the island's Central Collections and Compaction Plant. Despite its futuristic job, Avacs, largely unchanged since it began operating in 1976, is surprisingly mechanical. There are no computer screens, just six dials for pressure and air speed.""You can tell everything going on in the system just from these dials,"" Scott Langdon, a stationary engineer called Bones (everyone at the plant gets a nickname), said in the glass-enclosed control room.As the needles bob back and forth during three-second bursts of suction, Roosevelt Island's waste is pulled into collection chambers, one for the east side and one for the west side. The trash is then compressed into large green trash bins and driven off the island, either to a nearby marine transfer station or to New Jersey.For a sanitation center, the plant appears remarkably clean. The painted concrete floors are spotless but for some flecks of dust. The air carries a slightly ripe scent, like shrink-wrapped peaches, but hardly the olfactory assault one would expect among dozens of tons of trash, or even a New York City sidewalk in the middle of summer.More than the lack of trucks, this may be the system's greatest virtue, the cleanliness it exudes -- or rather the filth that it does not. Within the plant, this commitment to cleanliness is a practical matter, too.""If even a speck of something got into one of the machines, it could break down, or even explode,"" Mr. Langdon said.The employees operating Avacs have never collected trash from the streets, and instead have backgrounds as mechanics and maintenance workers more familiar with boilers and centrifuges than garbage bags. The problems they encounter on a weekly basis come in all shapes and sizes, though the source is the same: people throwing out what they should not. The workers devise all kinds of lassos, iron crosses ""and other medieval devices,"" as Mr. Langdon put it, to clear the tubes.When serious problems occur, such as damage to the tubes -- steel plate is strong, but can withstand only so many high-speed impacts -- a crew from Sweden, a world leader in pneumatic garbage, makes the trans-Atlantic journey to slide through the tubes and patch holes.The more troublesome trash for the tubes includes cardboard boxes and furniture. Textbooks are bad, Christmas trees worse. Oversize items, as well as recyclables, are supposed to be collected by building workers and delivered to the plant, but sometimes they wind up in the tubes with the regular trash.A jungle of large house plants, all salvaged from the trash, grows just outside the control room.""Part of me wonders why people would think it's O.K. to throw this stuff away,"" said Al DiGregorio, the chief engineer in the Sanitation Department's Bureau of Building Maintenance, which oversees Avacs. ""Part of me wonders how they ever get it in the chute.""That could be because many Roosevelt Island residents have little idea Avacs exists. ""I wasn't even sure because it sounds like something out of 'Willy Wonka,' "" Barbara Lippert, a resident for two years, said.The system's biggest fans may be the landlords, who do not worry about collecting or storing garbage. The Related Companies, developer of the Riverwalk complex, likes Avacs so much that it is installing one at Hudson Yards on the West Side of Manhattan. There, three tubes will handle trash, recycling and possibly compost.Building over the Pennsylvania Station tracks leaves no room for basements, but that is not the only consideration.""We don't want people enjoying the art or shopping beside huge piles of garbage,"" Charlotte Matthews, the vice president for sustainability at Related, said.",0.0
World Briefing | Asia; Sri Lanka: Campaign Violence Kills One:   [Brief ],,"KOTAHENA, Sri Lanka -- Sri Lanka's parliamentary election campaign took a deadly turn on Friday when unidentified gunmen opened fire into a crowd at a campaign meeting, killing one woman and injuring 12 other people.The country's finance minister, Ravi Karunanayake, was at the meeting in Kotahena, a suburb of the capital, Colombo. He said he had been leaving when gunmen in a car started spraying bullets into the crowd of about 500 attendees.""I was the target,"" Mr. Karunanayake said. ""This was an act of political terrorism.""Though he was only 20 feet from the shooting, he escaped uninjured, he said.The episode was the first major violence in a campaign that has been highly charged, with the return of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as an opposition candidate for Parliament.Mr. Karunanayake's party leads a broad political coalition that defeated Mr. Rajapaksa in his bid for re-election as president in January. The coalition has since regrouped to try to prevent Mr. Rajapaksa from winning a majority in the Aug. 17 election and becoming prime minister.Mr. Karunanayake said he suspected that the shooting on Friday may have been meant to help Mr. Rajapaksa's political comeback by spreading fear of terrorism before the election.""The attack was unprovoked,"" he said. ""These were just innocent people.""Mr. Rajapaksa's spokesman, Rohan Welivita, dismissed Mr. Karunanayake's suspicion in a telephone interview, saying it was ""ridiculous"" and ""irresponsible"" for a government minister to make such a suggestion.""Mr. Karunanayake is not the police,"" Mr. Welivita said. ""He cannot reach this conclusion without a complete investigation.""He continued: ""We totally deny these charges. Mr. Rajapaksa is in the Southern Province campaigning today. He has nothing to do with this violence.""The Center for Monitoring Election Violence, a local watchdog group, said the gunmen were dressed in black and arrived in two unmarked black cars. Citing police reports, the group said that 16 shell casings had been found at the scene, indicating that at least that many rounds were fired.Five of the wounded people were critically injured and are in the intensive care unit at a government hospital in Colombo, the group said.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",0.0
"Holiday Weekend Bargain-Hunting, for Fares and Rooms:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"Last year on the Friday after Thanksgiving, Diana Stilson snagged a stay at a Hawaiian hotel, paying 10 percent of the list price through a deal on Expedia. This Thanksgiving weekend, she hopes to find a similar vacation bargain online.After years of intense competition among retailers over Thanksgiving weekend, hotel, airline and other travel websites have entered the fray, holding sales of their own in the hope of steering holiday spending to travel and experiences.The cut-rate travel deals are already now ""standard in the industry,"" said Cole Hernandez, a spokesman for Denihan, a hotel operator. Her company has Thanksgiving weekend deals planned for its upscale hotels in Manhattan.""We saw a real jump in Black Friday-Cyber Monday hotel deals last year and expect even more this year,"" said Chris Anderson, professor of hotel administration at Cornell University. The hotels use the promotions for a variety of reasons, he said, including to attract new customers, to sell rooms that might otherwise be empty and to associate their brand with the excitement of the season.Hotels are not the only ones offering the bargains: Airlines, aggregators, tour companies and others with travel-focused websites are joining in.Customers are responding to the offers, companies say. A 2014 deal that cut the price of stays at the Hilton Waikoloa Village in Hawaii by 50 percent generated more than 11,000 booked nights in 24 hours, a significant increase compared with the daily average, according to Hilton. Grand Lucayan, a resort on Grand Bahama Island, topped $103,000 in revenue on the day of its 2014 Monday-after-Thanksgiving sale, five times the revenue generated on that day the previous year.Like many of the best-priced deals on Thanksgiving weekend, supplies are often limited. There are only so many rooms or flights that travel companies are willing to part with at the lowest prices, Mr. Anderson said. Additionally, those sales aim to be incremental and not replacing higher-revenue business.""The last thing a hotel wants is customers who would have purchased at higher prices getting access to these low prices,"" he said, so programs are devised with parameters like specific stay dates or limited room availability.Val Kalliecharan, a vacation planner on Turks and Caicos, said that sales there helped hotels fill rooms that might be vacant in their least popular times like January. ""Any holes that can be filled go directly to the bottom line,"" he said. The sales also allow hotels to sell the rooms straight to guests rather than through third-party booking sites like Expedia, Ms. Hernandez said.Expedia itself is offering deep discounts. The company tried its first large-scale Monday-after-Thanksgiving promotion last year, said Sarah Waffle Gavin, a spokeswoman for Expedia, and ended up with the third-busiest day of the year in terms of transactions. This year's post-Thanksgiving sales will be even more extensive, she said, including a mobile-only offer on Friday and promotions on Monday for 90 percent off room rates at four top-tier hotels in four cities. Every hour, the hotels and cities will change, encouraging customers to check the site often.Thanksgiving weekend travel purchases may be displacing physical purchases as experiences gain in popularity as gift items. Salina Gray hopes to find a Christmas vacation for her family instead of store-bought gifts like electronics and clothing.""It's the only time of year the whole family can go away together,"" Ms. Gray said, ""but it's also the most expensive time to travel."" If she can find a trip, she said, ""we can just shop the after-Christmas sales for a few things when we get back.""Travel companies are encouraging this shift. ""We see travel gift-giving pick up during the holiday time frame,"" Ms. Gavin said. Expedia's Hotels.com started gift cards last year to serve this market.Smaller travel companies are also joining the sale. Peggy Goldman, owner of Friendly Planet Travel in Jenkintown, Pa., is offering a 24-hour deal promoting up to $500 off her company's tours to destinations like Cuba and India. ""It's one of the most searchable sales of the year,"" she said, and plans to participate using digital marketing techniques to compete with the larger travel companies.Student Universe, a Boston travel agency that aims at students, says it holds after-Thanksgiving sales because college students are typically home with their parents over the weekend and can make large purchase decisions together for their travel.Airlines are also promoting discounts. The Alaska Airlines website is advertising a Monday sale, but no specific travel dates or destinations have been released yet. The site encourages customers to keep checking back for details. On Nov. 29-30, Fiji Airways is offering up to 40 percent off round-trip flights to Fiji, Australia and New Zealand.Travel companies are mixing and matching their delivery vehicles to reach a variety of customers. Hotwire will have an email exclusive offer on Friday, and a mobile exclusive offer on Monday, both adding savings on top of the broader sale it is holding in November.For consumers, part of the lure is the thrill of the hunt. ""The deals get snapped up quickly, so you have to be ready to hit the buy button,"" said Ms. Stilson, who found the hotel deal in Hawaii. ""But you also have to read the fine print about restrictions.""According to Ms. Gavin, it took only nine minutes for Expedia's Cyber Monday deals to sell out last year.Photograph Diana Stilson Snagged a Stay at a Hawaiian Hotel, Paying 10 Percent of the List Price Through a Deal On Expedia.; a Vacation Planner On Turks and Caicos Said That Sales There Helped Hotels Fill Rooms That Might Be Vacant During Slow Times.

What We Learned From German Prisons:   [Op-Ed ],,"EARLIER this summer, we led a delegation of people concerned about the United States criminal justice system to visit some prisons in Germany and observe their conditions. What we saw was astonishing.The men serving time wore their own clothes, not prison uniforms. When entering their cells, they slipped out of their sneakers and into slippers. They lived one person per cell. Each cell was bright with natural light, decorated with personalized items such as wall hangings, plants, family photos and colorful linens brought from home. Each cell also had its own bathroom separate from the sleeping area and a phone to call home with. The men had access to communal kitchens, with the utensils a regular kitchen would have, where they could cook fresh food purchased with wages earned in vocational programs.We hoped that we were getting a glimpse of what the future of the American criminal justice system could look like.This is an encouraging moment for American advocates of criminal justice reform. After decades of callousness and complacency, the United States has finally started to take significant steps to reverse what a recent report by the National Research Council called a ""historically unprecedented and internationally unique"" experiment in mass incarceration. Congress, in a bipartisan effort, seems prepared to scale back draconian federal sentencing laws. Many states are making progress in reducing their prison populations. And President Obama, in a gesture of his commitment to this issue, last month became the first American president to visit a federal correctional facility.The delegation that we took to Germany represented the emerging national consensus on this issue. It included a Democratic governor; corrections officials from across the political spectrum; chief prosecutors; formerly incarcerated individuals; a liberal scholar of race and criminal justice; and representatives from Right on Crime and the Charles Koch Institute, conservative groups that advocate reform, as well as the evangelical Christian group Prison Fellowship.But for all the signs of progress, truly transformative change in the United States will require us to fundamentally rethink values. How do we move from a system whose core value is retribution to one that prioritizes accountability and rehabilitation? In Germany we saw a potential model: a system that is premised on the protection of human dignity and the idea that the aim of incarceration is to prepare prisoners to lead socially responsible lives, free of crime, upon release.While the United States currently incarcerates 2.2 million people, Germany -- whose population is one-fourth the size of ours -- locks up only about 63,500, which translates to an incarceration rate that is one-tenth of ours. More than 80 percent of those convicted of crimes in Germany receive sentences of ""day fines"" (based on the offense and the offender's ability to pay). Only 5 percent end up in prison. Of those who do, about 70 percent have sentences of less than two years, with few serving more than 15 years.The incarcerated people that we saw had considerable freedom of movement around their facilities and were expected to exercise judgment about how they used their time. Many are allowed, a few times a year, to leave the prison for a few hours or overnight to visit friends and family. Others resided in ""open"" facilities in which they slept at night but left for work during the day. Solitary confinement is rare in Germany, and generally limited to no more than a few days, with four weeks being the outer extreme (as opposed to months or years in the United States).The process of training and hiring corrections officers is more demanding in Germany. Whereas the American corrections leaders in our delegation described labor shortages and training regimes of just a few months, in the German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, less than 10 percent of those who applied to be corrections officers from 2011 to 2015 were accepted to the two-year training program. This seems to produce results: In one prison we visited, there were no recorded assaults between inmates or on staff members from 2013 to 2014.Germans, like Americans, are greatly concerned with public safety. But they think about recidivism differently. During our visit, we heard prison professionals discussing failure in refreshingly unfamiliar terms: If, after release, an individual were to end up back in prison, that would be seen as a reason for the prison staff members to ask what they should have done better. When we told them stories of American politicians who closed a work-release or parole program after a single high-profile crime by a released inmate, they shook their heads in disbelief: Why would you close an otherwise effective program just because one client failed?To be sure, there are significant differences between the two countries. Most notably, America's criminal justice system was constructed in slavery's long shadow and is sustained today by the persistent forces of racism. The American prison-building binge was fueled by a political environment in which ""tough on crime"" was a winning campaign strategy.But the German context still provides a vision of a possible American future. The first article of the German Constitution reads, ""Human dignity shall be inviolable."" Granted, our own Constitution bans cruel and unusual punishment and protects individuals against excessive government intrusions. As was noted by the Supreme Court justice Anthony M. Kennedy in a landmark 2011 opinion ordering California to reduce its prison population: ""Prisoners retain the essence of human dignity inherent in all persons. Respect for that dignity animates the Eighth Amendment.""These words hold much promise, but currently they have far too little impact on actual conditions in American prisons. In Germany, we found that respect for human dignity provides palpable guidance to those who run its prisons. Through court-imposed rules, staff training and a shared mission, dignity is more than legal abstraction.The question to ask is whether we can learn something from a country that has learned from its own terrible legacy -- the Holocaust -- with an impressive commitment to promoting human dignity, especially for those in prison. This principle resonates, though still too dimly at the moment, with bedrock American values.AuthorAffiliation NICHOLAS TURNER and JEREMY TRAVIS Nicholas Turner is the president of the Vera Institute of Justice.

"Yanks Lose, but Prized Rookie Gains Kudos:   [Sports Desk ]",,"His preparations complete, Luis Severino left the bullpen and made his way across the outfield grass toward the first-base dugout. Soon, he would take the mound in a major league stadium for the first time. As he made that walk, he reflected on what the moment meant.""I felt really happy to be here,"" Severino said through an interpreter.The way Severino pitched, with a varied repertoire, an uncompromising competitiveness and a calm-beyond-his-years demeanor, left the Yankees feeling pleased, too.The Yankees lost, 2-1, baffled by the Boston Red Sox knuckleball pitcher Steven Wright, but it seemed a trifling inconvenience when viewed against what they stood to gain: a ballyhooed 21-year-old pitching prospect who lived up to every bit of his billing.For a team with a brittle starting rotation and an organization that has not produced a rotation regular since Andy Pettitte nearly 20 years ago, Severino offered encouragement. Severino allowed two runs (one earned) and just two hits -- one of them a home run by David Ortiz -- and struck out seven in five innings.Severino fell behind 13 of the 18 batters he faced, but he missed just off the edges and did not walk a batter. Six times the Red Sox ran the count full, but Severino won every battle -- including a 10-pitch at-bat that ended with a strikeout of Mike Napoli. The other run he allowed came on a two-out, second-inning double by Alejandro De Aza that scored Napoli, who had reached on third baseman Chase Headley's throwing error.The Red Sox could do little with Severino's fastball, which sat mostly at 96 miles per hour; a cut fastball; a tight slider; and a sporadically used changeup. The home run and the double were the only balls they hit out of the infield.Ortiz called Severino's pitches ""explosive,"" and Blake Swihart complimented his composure.""There's no question we'll see Severino a lot in years to come,"" Red Sox Manager John Farrell said. ""That's a good-looking young pitcher.""Severino received as many kudos from his teammates. Several used the same phrase to describe his demeanor: as if he had been here before. ""He was a bulldog,"" outfielder Chris Young said. ""And I thought his stuff was electric. He was amazing.""Severino was the 14th Yankee to make his major league debut this season, and easily the most eagerly awaited. Severino, outfielder Aaron Judge and first baseman Greg Bird are the prospects General Manager Brian Cashman refused to part with before last Friday's nonwaiver trade deadline, which nixed any chance they had to acquire any of the coveted pitchers who were available, including David Price.Such anticipation for an elite pitching prospect is not uncommon. Stephen Strasburg, Mark Prior and Matt Harvey generated a kinetic buzz when they arrived in the major leagues. But Jim Hendry -- a Cashman adviser who was the Cubs' general manager when Prior debuted -- said it was typically college pitchers who generated the most excitement because they had reached the major leagues shortly after they had been drafted.""You knew there weren't far off,"" Hendry said. ""Severino is different.""The Yankees signed Severino in 2012, but they did not have much competition and it did not become clear what type of prospect they had until he arrived in the United States the next year. He began last season at Class A Charleston and progressed quickly enough that the Yankees limited his innings and pitch counts so that he would be available to join them this season without restrictions.Manager Joe Girardi said it was not unreasonable to expect Severino to go further into games after the first-game adrenaline abates. The Yankees can certainly use more performances like Wednesday, given the delicate state of their rotation. Michael Pineda is expected to be out for a month with a strained right forearm, and Masahiro Tanaka and Ivan Nova are being treated gently while recovering from torn elbow ligaments. The erstwhile ace, C. C. Sabathia, has performed far below his standards.Headley said that while the Yankees did not swing a trade last week, as many of the other contenders did, the addition of Severino could give them that kind of boost. ""When you bring up someone that has that kind of ability, it can really swing the needle,"" Headley said.The Yankees did not swing the bats well against Wright, whose knuckleball dipped and darted, and was as hard for Swihart, the Red Sox catcher, to handle as it was for the Yankees batters to hit -- no small task against a team that had scored 90 runs in its previous 10 games. They managed only four hits and struck out nine times in eight innings against Wright, their only run coming on Carlos Beltran's solo homer.The Yankees managed to put two runners on in the ninth, but closer Koji Uehara retired Brian McCann on a fly ball to center to end the game.The Yankees were hoping from McCann what the Red Sox got from Ortiz in the fourth, when he ripped a 2-0 fastball on the inner half of the plate far into the right-field bleachers. It was his 46th career home run at the Stadium.It was also one of the few moments when Severino did look as if it was just another night in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre or Trenton, the two minor league affiliates where he pitched this season. It was, he said, about the only difference.""When you make a mistake,"" Severino said. ""You pay for it here.""INSIDE PITCHThe Yankees re-signed first baseman-outfielder GARRETT JONES on Wednesday, less than a week after they designated him for assignment when they acquired DUSTIN ACKLEY from Seattle.

A Star Swimmer's Challenging Turn:   [Sports Desk ],,"KAZAN, Russia -- The athletic superambassador Missy Franklin would seem to have more obstacles to overcome in her summer of 2015 sequel than Tom Cruise's superspy Ethan Hunt, whose latest big-screen exploits in ""Mission: Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" were watched by Franklin before she joined the United States swim team for the World Aquatics Championships.Franklin's mission, starting Sunday in this capital city of the Republic of Tatarstan, is to build on the history she made in 2013 in Barcelona, Spain, where she won a record six gold medals to increase her world championships total to nine, another record. With a victory in the 200-meter backstroke, one of her four individual events, Franklin would become the first woman to win three successive world championships in the same event.Franklin, 20, is one of the headliners in the eight-day swimming component of the competition, which has a decidedly female-centric marquee. The absence of Michael Phelps, left home as part of the fallout from his drunken-driving arrest last fall, and others like the Australian sprinter James Magnussen and the Japanese individual medley specialist Kosuke Hagino, both injured, has thrust the women into the spotlight.Can the freestyler Katie Ledecky repeat as the female swimmer of the meet after winning four golds and setting two world records in Barcelona? Will 16-year-old Daria K. Ustinova of Russia challenge Franklin in the backstroke events? How will Katinka Hosszu of Hungary fare in her seven individual events?And can Franklin hold off the likes of Ledecky, Ustinova and Hosszu and resume her reign, interrupted last summer by back spasms, as the chlorine queen?The two years since Barcelona have changed Franklin in ways that are discernible only when you wade beyond her surface sunniness -- the resplendent smile, the resonant laugh, the spontaneous dance moves and the sparkly red- and blue-painted fingernails.Franklin turned professional in March after leading the California Golden Bears to the team title at the N.C.A.A. championships, an elevation in status that has transformed her childhood passion into her first grown-up job. The transition can be fraught, said Teri McKeever, the California women's coach and a United States women's assistant coach here.""Swimming in college, you have that team support,"" McKeever said, ""and when it then becomes about their own individual performance and maybe the sponsor dollars are tied to performance, that creates challenges for people.""To traverse the oceanic gulf between swimming for fun, as part of a high school, collegiate or club team, and swimming for performance bonuses as a sports-styled entrepreneur requires a self-centeredness that is not second nature to Franklin.""That's why this next chapter of my life is going to be such an adventure,"" she said, adding with a laugh: ""I'm very worried I'm going to become high maintenance. That's my biggest fear.""The transition has been made harder by the lingering effects of a back injury that Franklin sustained at the Pan Pacific Championships last August. She experienced back spasms during one of her final practices before the meet and struggled through her events. Her best individual finish was third in the 100 backstroke.It took seven months, Franklin said, before she was able to swim a race without fear of reinjuring her back. She said the N.C.A.A. championships were ""the first meet where I was actually able to get up on the blocks and just swim.""Franklin turned in a remarkable performance at that meet, becoming the first woman to break the 1-minute-40-second barrier in the 200-yard freestyle on her way to one of her three individual victories. She also swam on two relays in her only major competition in the time leading up to the world championships.She raced in one long-course meet at the 2015 Arena Pro Swim Series in Santa Clara, Calif., in June, and produced the 18th-fastest time in the world this year in the 200-meter backstroke, her favorite event. Franklin got a late jump on her long-course preparation because she was engrossed in her studies until May. A psychology major, Franklin maintains a 3.58 grade-point average, which earned her 2015 Capital One Academic All-American of the Year honors.""I was working as hard out of the pool as I was in the pool, and that's the interesting thing,"" Franklin said. ""You know you're not going to get recognized in the newspaper for getting an A on your midterm; you're going to get recognized for going under 1:40 in the 200 free. But for me, that doesn't mean I'm going to work any less hard to get that A. To get that kind of recognition, it means the world to me.""At the end of the school year, Franklin moved back home to the Denver area to train with her childhood coach Todd Schmitz. The decision to leave Berkeley, where Franklin faced world-class competition daily, to return to her club team, the Colorado Stars, where her training partners are primarily high schoolers, raised eyebrows in swimming circles and caused consternation among the teammates she left behind.The dynamic between a club coach and a college coach can be likened to a joint-custody arrangement in parenting. Provided the parties are on the same page, the athlete can be handed off from one to the other without any trauma or drama. Communication is the key.""I think it's the coaches' responsibilities to listen to the athlete and honor the athlete's wishes,"" McKeever said.Franklin said the decision to move from one training base to the other signaled an important first step toward taking control of her career.""It was so hard doing the best thing for me but also knowing it was going to mean being away from my family out in Berkeley,"" Franklin said.In the end, the siren call of her nuclear family -- her mother, D. A.; her father, Dick; and her canine ""sibling,"" Ruger, a 12-year-old Alaskan malamute -- was too great.""I'm going through a really exciting life transition right now,"" Franklin said, ""and my parents are such a huge part of my life, I really wanted to be with my parents for this part of it.""She added, ""For me, it was a lot about family and being able to spend that time with them now.""McKeever's training regimen, which incorporates yoga, dance and spin classes with high-quality, race-pace water workouts, is distinct from Schmitz's approach, which is characterized by more yardage and less yoga.That was not the only adjustment Franklin faced. She is a more self-reliant person and swimmer than was the teenager who left Colorado two years ago, requiring a change in her dynamic with Schmitz, who filled the role of benevolent dictator in their first go-round.""It's completely different, but in a good way,"" Schmitz said. ""The way we interact with each other is 100 percent more collaborative.""Franklin gave an example that drove home her shift toward independence. During one recent week, she said, she was exhausted from training. She asked Schmitz if she could skip a midweek morning workout so she could sleep in, and make up the session over the weekend.""That was hard for me because I knew I was asking him to come in on a Saturday on his weekend off,"" Franklin said. ""That's a selfish thing to do. But I also know he's going to understand I'm going to have better workouts the rest of the week if I sleep in.""Franklin's performance over eight days starting Sunday will be treated, fairly or not, as a referendum on the path she has chosen to usher in her pro career. Franklin sounded sanguine about the next 12 months, which will culminate, she hopes, with a star turn at the 2016 Summer Olympics.""I think one of the best things an athlete can do is make the best of any situation that they're in,"" Franklin said, ""and give their best regardless of the situation.""Photograph Missy Franklin, Center, with Chelsea Chenault, Far Left, and Jessica Hardy On Thursday at the World Championships.

"My Friend, the Shoplifter:   [Metropolitan Desk ]",,"Dear Diary:I know a guy. Well, actually, he knows me. Every time we see each other he always greets me by name. My response is usually, ""Hey buddy,"" ""Yo, my man,"" ""What up, bro"" or something of that nature. We might have gone to the same school -- I'm not sure; you'd have to ask him.Anyway, we bumped into each other a few days ago in front of a supermarket on Farmers Boulevard in Springfield Gardens, Queens. The weather was unseasonably warm for November, yet he was wearing one of those bulky, thermally insulated one-piece body suits, the kind Parks Department personnel wear when they're working outside in January. He entered the store before me. I stopped to get a shopping cart and walked through the automatic sliding doors no more than 30 seconds after him.By the time I had pushed the cart to the middle of the store, he was already coming toward me from the opposite direction, headed back to the entrance (which for him was now the exit). At that point, three plainclothes security guards descended upon him; they pulled him to the side, in front of the display case with the ice cream.The guards told him, ""Give it up."" He bent down and started removing items through the pants leg of his one-piece body suit: a 32-ounce plastic bag of raw black beans, several cans of goods (one of which was probably tomato sauce), a large pack of sausages and some other stuff.After strolling away and reaching the other end of the aisle, I looked back and he was still bent over, still being relieved of the contents of his one-piece body suit. As I turned the corner, I wondered if he had pulled out a box or two of yellow rice mix. It was on sale.I envied my childhood friend, whose name I can't remember. If only I could be as decisive and efficient; I wish I could shop the way he lifts -- get in and get out. Well in his case, get in and almost get out.Read all recent entries and our updated submissions guidelines.

F.B.I. Director Speaks on Race and Police Bias:   [National Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, delivered an unusually candid speech on Thursday about the difficult relationship between the police and African-Americans, saying that officers who work in neighborhoods where blacks commit crimes at a high rate develop a cynicism that shades their attitudes about race.Citing the song ""Everyone's a Little Bit Racist"" from the Broadway show ""Avenue Q,"" he said police officers of all races viewed black and white men differently. In an address to students at Georgetown University, Mr. Comey said that some officers scrutinize African-Americans more closely using a mental shortcut that ""becomes almost irresistible and maybe even rational by some lights"" because black men are arrested at much higher rates than white men.In speaking about racial issues at such length, Mr. Comey used his office in a way that none of his predecessors had. His remarks also went beyond what President Obama and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. have said since an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., in August.Mr. Comey said that his speech, which was well received by law enforcement officials, was motivated by his belief that the country had not ""had a healthy dialogue"" since the protests began in Ferguson and that he did not ""want to see those important issues drift away.""Previous F.B.I. directors had limited their public comments about race to civil rights investigations, like murders committed by the Ku Klux Klan and the bureau's wiretapping of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But Mr. Comey tried to dissect the issue layer by layer.He started by acknowledging that law enforcement had a troubled legacy when it came to race.""All of us in law enforcement must be honest enough to acknowledge that much of our history is not pretty,"" he said. ""At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups.""Mr. Comey said there was significant research showing that all people have unconscious racial biases. Law enforcement officers, he said, need ""to design systems and processes to overcome that very human part of us all.""""Although the research may be unsettling, what we do next is what matters most,"" Mr. Comey said.He said nearly all police officers had joined the force because they wanted to help others. Speaking in personal terms, Mr. Comey described how most Americans had initially viewed Irish immigrants like his ancestors ""as drunks, ruffians and criminals.""""Law enforcement's biased view of the Irish lives on in the nickname we still use for the vehicle that transports groups of prisoners; it is, after all, the 'Paddy wagon,' "" he said.But he said that what the Irish had gone through was nothing compared with what blacks had faced.""That experience should be part of every American's consciousness, and law enforcement's role in that experience, including in recent times, must be remembered,"" he said. ""It is our cultural inheritance.""Unlike Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and Mr. Holder, who were roundly faulted by police groups for their critical remarks about law enforcement, Mr. Comey, a former prosecutor whose grandfather was a police chief in Yonkers, was praised for his remarks.Ron Hosko, the president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund and a former senior F.B.I. official, said that while Mr. Holder's statements about policing and race after the Ferguson shooting had placed the blame directly on the police, Mr. Comey's remarks were far more nuanced and thoughtful.""He looked at all the sociological pieces,"" Mr. Hosko said. ""The director's comments were far more balanced, because it wasn't just heavy-handed on the cops.""Mr. Comey said that the police have received most of the blame in episodes like the Ferguson shooting and the death of an unarmed black man in Staten Island who was placed in a chokehold by an officer, but law enforcement in ""not the root cause of problems in our hardest-hit neighborhoods.""In many of those areas, blacks grow up ""in environments lacking role models, adequate education and decent employment,"" he said.Mr. Comey said tensions could be eased if the police got to know those they were charged to protect.""It's hard to hate up close,"" he said.He also recommended that law enforcement agencies be compelled, by legislation if necessary, to report shootings that involve police officers, and that those reports be recorded in an accessible database. When Mr. Brown was shot in Ferguson, Mr. Comey said, F.B.I. officials could not say whether such shootings were common or rare because no statistics were available.""It's ridiculous that I can't tell you how many people were shot by the police last week, last month, last year,"" Mr. Comey said.He added, ""Without complete and accurate data, we are left with ideological thunderbolts.""Ronald E. Teachman, the police chief in South Bend, Ind., said Mr. Comey did not need to take on the issue. But Chief Teachman said it would be far easier for him to continue the discussion in Indiana now that Mr. Comey had done so in such a public manner.""It helps me move the conversation forward when the F.B.I. director speaks so boldly,"" he said.Mr. Comey concluded by quoting Dr. King, who said, ""We must all learn to live together as brothers, or we will all perish together as fools.""""We all have work to do -- hard work to do, challenging work -- and it will take time,"" Mr. Comey said. ""We all need to talk, and we all need to listen, not just about easy things, but about hard things, too. Relationships are hard. Relationships require work. So let's begin. It is time to start seeing one another for who and what we really are.""Photograph James B. Comey of the F.B.I. (A1); James B.

"Despite Volkswagen Scandal, Europe's Diesel Habit Could Be Hard to Kick:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"LONDON -- A loyal Volkswagen owner for years, Jane Kelley was ""shocked,"" she says, by recent revelations that the German company had cheated on emissions tests in the United States.Snug in Ms. Kelley's garage in North London recently was a white 2013 Passat powered by a 2-liter diesel engine. The company says that as many as 11 million of its cars -- Volkswagens, Audis, Skodas and SEATs with diesel engines -- were equipped with software designed to fool emissions testers.But as disturbed as she was to learn that Volkswagen had cheated, Ms. Kelley does not necessarily want anything done about it. ""Are they going to take my car away and fiddle with the engine?"" she said with a worried tone, as she served tea in her sunlit dining room.As with at least some European diesel drivers, Ms. Kelley is in no hurry to abandon the car just because it may spew more noxious fumes than she originally thought. ""I do feel that it is a very safe car,"" she said. She also admires the acceleration of the turbocharged diesel, which she credits with helping her recently escape a potential hazard. ""There was a guy weaving, maybe drunk, so I just shot by,"" she recalled.Ms. Kelley is one of millions of fans of diesel cars across Europe, where fuel prices and taxes make the cost of filling an automobile's tank much higher than in the United States. Drawn by diesels' superior fuel economy over gasoline engines and the lower price of diesel fuel, European consumers have long leaned toward diesel cars -- a collective habit that might be difficult to break, despite the new scrutiny the Volkswagen scandal has given to diesel's dark side.While diesels have struggled in the United States to overcome a reputation as smoke-belching clunkers -- they represent about 3 percent of the American car market -- they have rolled to dominance across the Atlantic. Diesels accounted for more than half the new cars sold in Western Europe last year, compared with 14 percent in 1990.Europeans' embrace of diesels has encouraged manufacturers to improve the engines' performance, and it has motivated governments, especially those of Germany and France, to support their auto industries' diesel efforts. Although environmentalists have been sounding alarms for years, the forces propelling diesel were so strong that it might explain why drivers, carmakers and regulators have been willing at times to overlook diesels' tendency to be bigger polluters than gasoline cars.""Ban diesels? You can't be serious,"" Ségolène Royal, the French environment and energy minister, said recently, responding to a suggestion by a member of the Green Party. ""We can't treat problems of this gravity with ideological slogans at the expense of French interests,"" Ms. Royal said, noting that more than half the cars on French roads were diesels.In fact, the percentage in France is around 64 percent, even higher than in Germany, with French-made Renault, Peugeot and Citroën diesels joining Volkswagens on the road. There has been no indication that the French automakers cheated on emissions tests.So far, Volkswagen has not said how it plans to deal with the deceptive software problem, although the German government has set an Oct. 7 deadline for the company to propose a solution. Unlike in the United States, where lawyers are already recruiting car owners in hopes of filing class-action lawsuits, there is no similar tradition in Europe that would encourage consumers to collectively demand financial redress.Volkswagen said on Tuesday that it would prepare a plan by early October to improve the emissions of affected vehicles. Owners will be notified in the weeks and months after the plan has been approved by authorities, the company said.""If there is a recall, I would be happy if my car is not included in it,"" said Tony Novak, a retired editor for the BBC who lives in Reading, England. In Britain, just over half of new cars sold are diesels.""Diesels used to be terrible -- they used to be dirty and slow,"" he said. ""Now they are brilliant."" Mr. Novak had owned diesel cars previously, but when he bought his 2014 Volkswagen Golf diesel, ""I was really surprised by how good it was -- you really notice the difference in acceleration.""That Volkswagen might have achieved that performance by cheating -- it is still not clear whether the company needed the deceptive software to pass Europe's emissions tests, which are much less strict than the United States' -- is not what matters most to Mr. Novak. ""I worry that if they tweak the computer, the performance will deteriorate,"" he said.About five million of the affected cars are Golfs, Passats and other Volkswagen-brand cars. An additional two million are Audi brand cars, and the rest or Skoda and SEAT brand cars, or light commercial vehicles.Matthias Müller, a company insider who was appointed chief executive of Volkswagen last week, told top managers late Monday that the deceptive software was activated in only a portion of the 11 million vehicles that have the so-called EA 189 diesel motors. But Volkswagen did not specify how many cars were designed to cheat on emissions tests.Some industry experts say that the Volkswagen scandal could prove a turning point in the diesel love affair, if the new scrutiny of European emissions standards and testing makes it easier for the environmentalists to be heard.The premise of the ""clean diesel"" notion that Volkswagen promoted was partly based on the fact that on a per-mile basis, diesel engines emit less carbon dioxide -- a big contributor to climate change -- than gasoline engines. But diesel exhausts, unless cleaned in ways that Volkswagen's software was designed to sidestep, produce larger quantities of other harmful gases -- nitrogen oxides -- along with fine particles that contribute to stubbornly persistent air quality problems in European cities.""There is a recognition that, fundamentally, it is going to be difficult to control all of the problems with diesel -- smoke production is not going to go away,"" said Peter Wells, co-director of the center for automotive industry research at Cardiff Business School. ""In the very long term, diesel has had its day.""According to the European Environment Agency, which monitors air quality, 20 to 30 percent of urban residents in Europe are exposed to particle levels -- mainly from diesel exhaust fumes -- above those considered safe by the European Union, while about 10 percent are exposed to unsafe levels of nitrogen oxides.London and Paris have among the highest pollution levels in terms of nitrogen oxides. In March of this year and last, the smog in Paris reached such levels that the authorities were forced to temporarily limit the number of cars on the road each day.Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, which is playing host to the United Nations climate conference in November, is among those who have suggested an eventual ban on diesels in the city.The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, plans to establish an ultralow emissions zone in London by 2020 where older diesels will be penalized. A recent report by the environmental committee of the London Assembly, the city's legislature, said the mayor should consider banning all diesels from the zone.But environmental efforts must contend with deeply rooted diesel economics. Automotive fuel in Europe costs several times as much as in the United States, mainly because of higher taxes. The average price of gasoline in London in August, for example, was 521 pence, or about $7.92, per gallon. In most of Continental Europe, diesel sells for about 15 percent less than gasoline.Part of that difference is because the taxes that help keep fuel prices high are typically lower on diesel fuel.In Germany, the lower taxes on diesel fuel amount to an annual subsidy of 7 billion euros, or about $7.8 billion, for diesel owners, said Daniel Moser, a transportation analyst for the environmental group Greenpeace.""These policies are not in accordance with what we would have to do to protect the environment and people's health,"" he said.And then there are vehicle tax breaks that various governments offer to diesel owners, because of the cars' lower emissions of carbon dioxide.Also, new diesels are often only slightly more expensive than their gasoline counterparts. In Britain, a Volkswagen Golf Match with a 1.4-liter, turbocharged gasoline engine sells for £20,955, or about $31,800, while a similar model with a 1.6-liter diesel engine sells for £21,960, according to Carbuyer, a British website.With all those factors taken into account, owning and operating a diesel car in Europe is the more affordable way to go.In the United States, with much lower gasoline prices, ""there is no point at the margin, buying a diesel,"" said Garel Rhys, a professor emeritus at Cardiff University. He said Europeans' embrace of diesels made perfect sense. ""Essentially, growth came because consumers are economically rational individuals,"" Professor Rhys said.But a continued yen for diesels may not necessarily translate into an abiding love of Volkswagen, for some Europeans at least.Jon Devereux, who drives a diesel-engine Volkswagen Touareg, manages a hotel in Milford on Sea, in southern England. Each winter, he takes the four-wheel-drive vehicle to his winter home in the French Alps. The Touareg, he said, has ""been brilliant for 10 years.""But when it comes time to replace it, his next diesel will not be a Volkswagen. The emissions scandal has soured Mr. Devereux on the carmaker. ""Would you buy a VW car or any car in the VW group?"" he asked.",0.0
Emerging Clinton Team Shows Signs of Disquiet:   [National Desk ],,"Lingering tensions between Hillary Rodham Clinton's loyalists and the strategists who helped President Obama defeat her in 2008 have erupted into an intense public struggle over who will wield money and clout in her emerging 2016 presidential campaign.At issue is controlling access to the deep-pocketed donors whose support is critical to sustain the outside organizations that are paving the way for Mrs. Clinton's campaign. It is a competition that has been exacerbated, many Clinton supporters said, by Mrs. Clinton's reluctance to formally enter the race and establish a campaign organization with clear lines of authority.The dispute broke into the open on Monday after David Brock, a Clinton ally, accused Priorities USA Action -- a pro-Clinton ""super PAC"" whose co-chairman is Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's 2012 campaign manager -- of planting negative stories about the fund-raising practices of Mr. Brock's organizations. Mr. Brock resigned from the super PAC's board in protest.Mr. Messina is one of the half-dozen top veterans of Mr. Obama's campaigns that Mrs. Clinton's tightknit circle of advisers has hired or courted, vexing some longtime Clintonites seeking more prominent roles for themselves. Other former Obama aides are working with pro-Clinton groups to organize grass-roots volunteers or to fend off attacks on her record, efforts that some Democrats view as the first step toward a place in Mrs. Clinton's campaign when it finally gets off the ground.All recognize that Mrs. Clinton's political operation could dominate the Democratic Party for the next decade, controlling the flow of commissions, consulting work and political appointments. But the marriage between the two camps -- based to a large degree on mutual interest, if not love -- now appears more uneasy than at any time since Mr. Obama asked Mrs. Clinton to serve in his administration after the 2008 election.""It is 'The Dream Team,' but only five can start,"" said John Morgan, a Florida lawyer who has raised money for Mr. Obama and hosted fund-raisers with former President Bill Clinton. ""Who do you put at guard? Jordan, LeBron, Kobe, Magic, Bird, Derrick Rose? That is where it is.""The list of Obama veterans now working in ""Clinton World"" includes the New York-based pollster Joel Benenson, whom Mrs. Clinton has settled on as chief strategist over several pollsters with long Clinton ties. A consulting firm founded by two Obama voter-turnout specialists, Mitch Stewart and Jeremy Bird, is being paid $20,000 a month by Ready for Hillary, a super PAC focused on organizing grass-roots Clinton supporters. Jim Margolis, whose firm handled lucrative media-buying contracts for Mr. Obama's campaigns, will also advise Mrs. Clinton, whose campaign will probably raise and spend over a billion dollars in the next two years.But Mr. Brock's path to the Clinton inner circle is perhaps the most convoluted. Once a conservative journalist whose reporting on President Clinton prompted Paula Jones's 1994 sexual harassment lawsuit against him, Mr. Brock has since emerged as a prominent liberal organizer and one of Mrs. Clinton's chief defenders.With the tacit blessing of both Clintons, Mr. Brock has maneuvered his $28 million network of media-monitoring and opposition research organizations into the center of the emerging Clinton effort, establishing a new project, Correct the Record, that has defended Mrs. Clinton in the news media and even issued daily emails explaining her positions.His successful fund-raising has been led by Mary Pat Bonner, whose firm has been paid millions of dollars by Mr. Brock's groups to court donors -- some of whom have criticized the arrangement as well as Mr. Brock.""He is a cancer,"" said Mr. Morgan, who is close to Mr. Messina.""If you care about your party and our country, you just do what you are asked,"" said Mr. Morgan, referring to Mr. Brock's public resignation from Priorities USA, which immediately reignited tales of infighting from Mrs. Clinton's 2008 campaign. ""If you care about yourself, you take your toys and go home.""Mr. Brock declined to comment.Susie Tompkins Buell, a friend of Mrs. Clinton's and a donor from San Francisco who is close to Mr. Brock, said he ""is an incredibly important part of the Democratic Party"" whose work ""protects us from the onslaught and destruction of the Republican attack machine.""Ms. Buell added: ""Certain people are trying to destroy David through off-the-record conversations with reporters. They are spineless and devious.""Mr. Messina, now a consultant with a significant roster of corporate and political clients, became co-chairman of Priorities early last year, charged with helping the advertising-oriented super PAC secure hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions. But with the campaign season still a year away, Mr. Messina and his team have encountered some difficulty getting commitments, according to several Democrats involved in helping the group.Mr. Brock, in turn, has been reluctant to cede turf -- or pre-eminence -- to Obama veterans like Mr. Messina. ""He was never accepted"" by the Obama camp, said one Clinton loyalist, who like most people interviewed for this article declined to speak on the record for fear of angering either the president or the woman who hopes to replace him.Months ago, Mrs. Clinton's top advisers encouraged the three pro-Clinton super PACs -- Ready for Hillary, Priorities USA and Mr. Brock's American Bridge 21st Century -- to combine efforts. Mr. Brock's organization would provide opposition research to Priorities, which would eventually raise high-dollar donations to pay for attack ads. Ready for Hillary would dissolve after Mrs. Clinton officially declared her candidacy.But Priorities is the only one of the groups founded by Obama operatives, making it the least easiest to fit into the emerging Clinton apparatus. And all outside groups are facing increased competition from official party organizations, like the Democratic National Committee, which are now free to solicit their own million-dollar commitments from big donors, thanks to new campaign finance rules inserted into December's federal spending bill.In a statement, Mr. Messina suggested there was little tension with Mr. Brock or his organizations. ""Priorities USA Action works closely and cooperatively with progressive champion David Brock and American Bridge,"" he said. ""Both organizations have clear and complementary missions, and we look forward to continuing to work together to build on our shared success.""Several donors approached by Priorities in recent months, including some advised by Ms. Bonner, said they had already given generously or otherwise committed to Mr. Brock. Mr. Messina's allies worry that Clinton loyalists will seek to replace him with another strategist closer to Mrs. Clinton, perhaps Guy Cecil, previously a contender for the job of Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager.When the Priorities board issued a statement on Monday evening asking Mr. Brock to reconsider his resignation, it was signed not by Mr. Messina but by his co-chairwoman, Jennifer M. Granholm, the former Michigan governor and a Clinton supporter in 2008. Ms. Granholm and other Priorities officials have sought to soothe Mr. Brock, Democrats assisting the group said, and he has suggested he would be open to rejoining the super PAC's board.In an interview, Mr. Messina denied a report in BuzzFeed that he had used the controversy around Ms. Bonner's fees to try to rally donors around a pledge to hold back checks from any organizations paying fund-raisers on commission. Such a campaign could cripple Mr. Brock's groups, which rely entirely on Ms. Bonner's firm to raise money.""I've never heard of a petition, I don't know anything about it, no one has talked to me,"" Mr. Messina said. ""It's not true.""",0.0

Sober Goes Social:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"Is there anything that would make someone want to join a new social network at this point? We already have Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as well as smaller alternatives like Ello. And the advent of apps like Snapchat has made public blabbing less appealing than engaging in private communication.But Beau Mann, the chief executive and a founder of a new app called Sober Grid, says that for some users, joining this social network could be a matter of life and death. ""It sounds somewhat dramatic, but it's realistic,"" Mr. Mann said. ""Some people, their life is dependent on their sobriety. So that need to connect is how people get and maintain sobriety.""Sober Grid is for those who are battling addiction. It has a public news feed where users can post messages about their struggles and successes with sobriety, a grid of photos of potential ""sober friends,"" a messaging platform and other features that will be familiar to users of Facebook and other networking platforms. It can be used anonymously, though many users include first names and photos.The photos of potential friends can make Sober Grid seem like a dating app for teetotalers, an impression Mr. Mann would like to discourage. He hopes it will appeal to a broader group.""There's lots of sober people that are married, and if it's a dating app, they won't be able to go on there and get the support that they need,"" he said.Sober Grid was launched in New York on July 9 and has grown quickly. Around 5 percent of those who have signed up have opted to pay $39.99 a year for a premium membership, which permits posting four additional profile photos and visiting in ""stealth mode"" to guard anonymity.Sober Grid can be a bit clunky to use, and the purpose of some of its sections is difficult to discern. No explanation is provided within the app, for instance, for a blank ""visitors"" tab. (It keeps track of users who have looked at your profile, unless they have done so in stealth mode.)Even features within the app's main section, the grid, can be confusing. There is a ""burning desire"" button geared toward users worried about falling off the wagon and seeking the intervention of others. But Mr. Mann said many users did not understand the button's purpose. (Posting a message to the news feed appears to be the most effective way to attract help in a hurry.)Some may worry that building a network specifically for sober users will only add to the stigma they feel over being in recovery, and that people trying to beat addiction need not isolate themselves with a separate app. Mr. Mann, himself a recovering addict, described that notion as unrealistic.""We definitely want to get to the point where there's no stigma,"" he said. ""But that's not the reality right now.

Parliament of Kosovo Votes to Amend Constitution to Allow for War Crimes Court:   [Foreign Desk ],,"LONDON -- The Kosovo Parliament has amended the country's Constitution to allow for the creation of a war crimes court, which is expected to try ethnic Albanians accused of war crimes.The move is viewed by many world powers, including the United States and the European Union, as a vital prerequisite for regional reconciliation in the aftermath of the bloody Balkan wars of the 1990s.The 120-seat Parliament approved the constitutional changes by a vote of 82 to 5 on Monday, Petrit Selimi, the deputy foreign minister, said in a phone interview on Tuesday. The vote is a milestone in Kosovo, where opposition to the creation of the court has been robust.The court, which is to be made up of international judges and based in The Hague, is expected to hear war crimes cases, including accusations of organ harvesting committed against Serbs. Ethnic Albanians who oppose the court contend that it threatens to unfairly challenge the longstanding view of the 1998-99 Kosovo war and turn victims into perpetrators. Opposition politicians boycotted the vote.Ramush Haradinaj, a former guerrilla leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army and former prime minister of Kosovo who now leads the opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, said the court would be detrimental to the country's image. ""By approving this court, we are turning ourselves into a monster,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""During the war, we were not monsters; we were victims.""Prosecutors in Serbia are investigating Mr. Haradinaj on war crimes allegations; he has rejected the accusations.But Mr. Selimi hailed the vote as ""overwhelming"" despite the loud opposition in Parliament, and said: ""The creation of the court is a necessary tool for Kosovars for the truth about our war for freedom. Perpetrators can never be equal with victims. Our war for freedom was not equal to Milosevic's drive for genocide.""Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on Feb. 17, 2008, almost a decade after NATO bombs helped push out Slobodan Milosevic, the former leader of Serbia, ending a brutal civil war against the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo. But attempts to come to terms with the past on both sides have been undermined by accusations that leading members of the Kosovo Liberation Army have evaded justice.Marko Djuric, the director of the Serbian government's Office for Kosovo, was quoted as saying by B92, an independent Serbian broadcaster, that the vote by Parliament was only a first step. ""We cannot be satisfied until those who have committed crimes have been punished,"" he said.In July 2014, Clint Williamson, an American diplomat who led a special European Union task force charged with investigating war crimes, said senior members of the Kosovo Liberation Army engaged in a campaign of persecution against ethnic Serbs after the 1998-99 Kosovo war.He said senior officials of the guerrilla group had intentionally targeted minority populations with acts of persecution that included ""unlawful killings, abductions, enforced disappearances, illegal detentions in camps in Kosovo and Albania, sexual violence, other forms of inhumane treatment, forced displacements of individuals from their homes and communities, and desecration and destruction of churches and other religious sites.""He said the evidence suggested that the guerrilla group had targeted people after the war to harvest and sell their organs.The task force was set up in September 2011 after a Council of Europe report accused Kosovo's former prime minister, Hashim Thaci -- the former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who is now the country's foreign minister -- of having led a group that smuggled human organs, weapons and heroin during and after the war.Mr. Thaci has denied the accusations.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

Review: 'What Nerve!' Presents an Alternative History of American Art:   [Review ],,"'WHAT NERVE!''Alternative Figures in American Art, 1960 to the Present'Matthew Marks Gallery502, 522 and 526 West 22nd Street, ChelseaThrough next FridayThis lavish, thrillingly revisionist show challenges the bias of postwar American art history in favor of New York, abstraction and Conceptual art. It presents the core of an earlier, larger version shown last fall at the Rhode Island School of Design Museum in Providence, also titled ""What Nerve! Alternative Figures in American Art, 1960 to the Present."" It has been reconfigured here by one of its curators, Dan Nadel, an expert on underground comics and postwar figurative art from beyond New York. Mr. Nadel seems to know where to find the best stuff in terms of unfamiliar pieces and fascinating ephemera.This show centers on two caches of works from the 1960s. One is the Pop-Surreal, comics-influenced efforts of Jim Nutt, Art Green, Suellen Rocca, Karl Wirsum, Jim Falconer and Gladys Nilsson, who led Chicago's Hairy Who movement with antic works painted on plexiglass, lawn chairs or canvas. They are joined by the messier idiosyncrasies of California Funk artists like the ceramist sculptors Ken Price and Robert Arneson and the painters Peter Saul and Roy De Forest, among others.Mr. Nadel places their often irreverent creations in a continuum with Destroy All Monsters, a Michigan punk band that included Mike Kelley and Jim Shaw and whose members are represented here by drawings, photographs and copies and page mock-ups for the band's magazine. It concludes with Forcefield, a collective from Providence that was featured in the 2002 Whitney Biennial. Consisting of Mat Brinkman, Jim Drain, Leif Goldberg and Ara Peterson, Forcefield specialized in anarchic music and videos, silkscreens and, most memorably, brightly knit head-to-toe body suits whose patterns zigzag suggestively from the primitive to the digital.Of the show's two main galleries, one is installed with typical Marksian spaciousness. The other reflects Mr. Nadel's omnivorous interests. Sadly, several important outliers in the first show have been eliminated: H. C. Westermann, William N. Copley, Gary Panter, Christina Ramberg, the superhero comic artist Jack Kirby and Elizabeth Murray, a New York painter from Chicago indebted to the Hairy Who.But this show, along with the excellent catalog for its original iteration, still teems with ideas that other curators should build on.Photograph Installation View at Matthew Marks's 522 West 22nd Street Gallery.

Substantiated Complaints About Police Use of Chokeholds Increase:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"Last year, a police oversight board substantiated six complaints by people who said New York City officers had restrained them with a chokehold, a banned maneuver that was used by an officer in the fatal encounter with Eric Garner on Staten Island in July.The number, while small, is a notable increase. From 2009 to 2013, the oversight agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, substantiated a total of nine chokehold complaints.The rise in verified chokeholds underscores a fact, tacitly acknowledged by police officials, that the move is used more than has been publicly known.All but one of the six complaints -- which came from encounters in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Upper Manhattan -- were substantiated after the death of Mr. Garner. Last month, the board substantiated a seventh chokehold complaint.In most substantiated chokehold cases, the review board has recommended that the police commissioner, who has final say, impose the stiffest form of departmental discipline, which can include suspension or termination. The board did so in five of the cases in 2014. But rather than severely penalizing officers who violate the ban, the Police Department has in recent years meted out little or no punishment.In the aftermath of Mr. Garner's death, top police officials are debating whether to go further and alter the ban to formally allow chokeholds in life-or-death situations.At the same time, top officials are strongly considering eliminating the term ""chokehold"" from The Patrol Guide, the department's internal rulebook, and replacing it with any ""pressure on the neck,"" said a police official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the discussions, over a variety of use-of-force policies, had yet to reach any conclusion.""It was a poor choice of words when we put it out in 1993,"" the official said. ""It did not capture all the dangerous restraints around the neck."" Whether to adopt an exemption for cases where deadly force would be justified has yet to be presented to Commissioner William J. Bratton for a final decision.The number of chokehold complaints filed with the board has remained relatively steady, with 222 last year compared with 179 in 2013 (and two substantiated) and 240 complaints in 2009 (and three substantiated). With little change in the number of complaints, the increase in those substantiated in 2014 pointed to changes in how the board evaluated such complaints under the leadership of Richard D. Emery, who was appointed as chairman on July 17.""These new figures suggest that chokeholds have been an even more serious problem than we realized,"" said Christopher T. Dunn, the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.In a report after Mr. Garner's death, Mr. Emery said both the Police Department and the review board's investigators had loosened their interpretation of the ban over time, changing the definition of a chokehold from force that may restrict breathing to a hold that actually did. The report found that, as a result, investigators missed some allegations of chokeholds and that even when it substantiated them, the department rarely imposed discipline.Mr. Emery, who will convene a monthly board meeting on Wednesday, was traveling abroad and did not immediately return a call and an email seeking comment on Tuesday.Mr. Garner's death brought new scrutiny on the use of chokeholds, from Police Headquarters, the review board and the city's new police inspector general.Though the use of chokeholds by officers is banned by department policy, there is no law prohibiting it. A bill before the City Council, opposed by the mayor, would make the maneuver illegal.Most of the seven substantiated cases involved complaints that were lodged before Mr. Bratton took over as commissioner last year.In one possibility being explored by officials, chokeholds could be taught at the Police Academy and officers who use one against a suspect would have their actions reviewed, much like what happens after a police shooting.The data on substantiated chokehold allegations comes from the review board's monthly reports, which are stripped of all information about the officers involved besides their assigned precinct or the circumstances that led to the chokehold.A spokeswoman for the board declined to comment or divulge details about the substantiated complaints or the officers involved, citing a frequently invoked clause in state law, Section 50-a of the Civil Rights Law, that protects the privacy of officers' personnel records. Freedom of information advocates are lobbying the State Legislature to amend or repeal that section.In 2014, the board fully investigated 127 allegations of an officer using a chokehold, up from 88 the year before and a similar number in 2011. (The agency's ability to take complaints in 2012 was affected by Hurricane Sandy.)Most substantiated cases eventually wind their way to the department's trial room, in proceedings that are open to the public but whose transcripts have been kept secret by the city, which has cited the Civil Rights Law.Mr. Bratton has said he would seek to speed the process, which has in the past taken years before a substantiated complaint reaches the commissioner's desk.Only one case, substantiated before he took over, has been decided during Mr. Bratton's tenure: A plainclothes officer in Queens was found not guilty of using a chokehold during a struggle with a bicyclist.",0.0
"Artists Take On the Music Industry, Calling for Change:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"Musicians are known for speaking out on issues like human rights, politics and the environment. They are less known for speaking out about how the music business itself should operate.That may be changing.When Taylor Swift publicly rebuked Apple in June over royalty payments, the company reversed its position and Ms. Swift's move was celebrated throughout the music world as a victory. But it was only the most prominent example of a growing trend of industry-focused activism undertaken by a range of artists, from big stars who take a principled stand to middle-class musicians who need to worry about paying the bills.""We're at a turning point,"" said the singer David Byrne, formerly of Talking Heads, who has been vocal on the economics behind digital music. ""Musicians, their managers and many others are frustrated. The black box of hidden transactions in the music business, while maybe not illegal, is a recipe for chicanery.""The activism has taken different shapes. Jay Z, for example, paid $56 million for the subscription streaming service Tidal, though his efforts to market it as an artist-friendly alternative have been criticized as clumsy. Prince, Neil Young and Ms. Swift have withdrawn their music from some streaming outlets, and various musicians have called for greater transparency in how the music industry operates.Over the last few weeks, dozens of acts, including R.E.M., Common and Chuck D of Public Enemy, took to social media to support a bill that would require radio stations to pay royalties to performers.The debate has been enabled by social media and reflects changes in many artists' attitudes toward the online economy over the last 15 years or so -- a period that stretches from the rise of Napster and iTunes to online streaming outlets like YouTube, Pandora and Spotify, and has been accompanied by enormous changes in how money flows through the industry.""The support that we're seeing, in terms of the range and number of artists, whether it's from somebody who's a working-class musician to somebody who's very successful, it's unprecedented,"" said Ted Kalo, the executive director of MusicFirst, a lobbying coalition that includes record labels and musicians' groups and that helped organize the social media campaign.The economics behind downloads is relatively simple: Typically about 70 percent of a song's retail price goes to a record company, which then pays its musicians according to its contracts. But with streaming, the system is complex and often opaque, as became apparent in May, when an outdated licensing contract between Sony and Spotify was leaked online, showing the elaborate formulas used in computing streaming rates.Public relations missteps in the early 2000s kept many musicians from speaking out about economic issues, artists and executives said. Those include the music industry's lawsuits against thousands of fans for online file-sharing, and the pillorying that the band Metallica received after it sued Napster for copyright infringement. But the shift toward streaming in recent years has prompted many musicians to investigate the changes in the business and comment online. Among them are independents like David Lowery of the band Cracker; Zoë Keating, a cellist who has documented her online royalties; and Blake Morgan, a singer-songwriter who owns a small record company and started an online campaign, #IRespectMusic, to draw attention to the issue.At the same time, musicians and songwriters of all stripes have begun to complain, often bitterly, of low royalty payments from streaming music. Last year, for example, Bette Midler spoke out against Pandora and Spotify, and Aloe Blacc said that he earned just $4,000 in songwriting royalties from 168 million streams on Pandora of Avicii's hit ""Wake Me Up,"" which Mr. Blacc helped write.In response, many streaming outlets point out that their actions are a legal and rapidly growing source of income for the industry as sales of CDs and downloads plunge. Pandora says it has paid nearly $1.5 billion in royalties since it started a decade ago, and Spotify, which went online in 2008, says it has paid $3 billion. Yet how much of that money makes its way into musicians' pockets remains hotly debated.Melvin Gibbs, a jazz bassist in New York who is the president of the Content Creators Coalition, said that declining royalties -- he recalled once getting a check for 3 cents -- were a factor that led him to study the business models of Internet companies that offer abundant music free or at low subscription prices.""None of these companies that are supposedly in the music business are actually in the music business,"" Mr. Gibbs said. ""They are in the data-aggregation business. They're in the ad-selling business. The value of music means nothing to them.""Several years ago Ms. Keating, who controls her own recordings, began posting detailed royalty statements from Spotify, and she has also reported on private negotiations with YouTube in which that company appeared to pressure her into signing a contract for its new music-subscription service.Despite growing complaints from middle-class musicians, it is still the stars who have the most impact. As Apple prepared last month to release its new streaming service, Apple Music, independent labels around the world said that the company's refusal to pay royalties for trial streams was unfair. But Apple did not budge until Ms. Swift scolded the company in a blog post -- whereupon Apple changed course in a matter of hours.Lobbying has become another battleground. In April, the Fair Play Fair Pay Act was introduced to Congress, which would require AM and FM radio stations to pay royalties to performers, in addition to songwriters. The bill has been hailed by musicians and opposed by broadcasters, who have long argued that by playing a song on air they give it valuable promotion.But a side controversy has emerged over the MIC Coalition, a Washington advocacy group that includes Pandora, the National Association of Broadcasters and others that have frequently opposed the music industry over royalty matters. In June, Amazon withdrew its membership, and a senior executive told Billboard magazine that the company's primary interest in transparency was ""getting lost in the wilder noise surrounding rate-setting.""Two weeks ago, National Public Radio also dropped out of the coalition after complaints from the Content Creators Coalition, which accused it of ""working in Washington to deny fair pay to the very artists it purports to celebrate on their air.""A spokeswoman for the MIC Coalition -- whose name stands for Music, Innovation, Consumers -- said that the group had not taken a position on the Fair Play act, though many of its members had as individuals. Michael Riksen, NPR's vice president for policy and representation, declined to say why the organization had left the MIC Coalition. But he said that he ""viewed the coalition as a way for the voice and values of public radio and NPR to be part of a broad-based conversation about copyright reform.""""Had it taken a position"" on the bill, Mr. Riksen added, ""we wouldn't have joined in the first place.""The political chances are also unclear for the Fair Play bill, whose other provisions include paying royalties to artists for recordings made before 1972, which are not covered by federal copyright. Similar efforts have failed in the past, and the National Association of Broadcasters says that 203 members of the House and 19 senators have signed a nonbinding resolution opposing it.Still, Mr. Byrne and other musicians pushing for the bill say they are undeterred.""This one can be won, then we can move on to the harder ones,"" Mr. Byrne said. ""Why this time? Can't point to anything specific. It feels right, and as musicians that's what often drives us.""Photograph Melvin Gibbs, a Jazz Bassist, Is the President of the Content Creators Coalition.

Final Motorcyclist Sentenced in '13 Assault on S.U.V. Driver:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"A state judge sentenced the last of the motorcyclists convicted of attacking a driver in Upper Manhattan to three and a half years in prison on Thursday after the defendant gave a tearful apology in court.The defendant, Robert Sims, 37, a Brooklyn electrician, said he had lost control when he and several other bikers dragged Alexian Lien from his Range Rover on 178th Street near Wadsworth Avenue and beat him in front of his wife, Rosalyn Ng, and their 2-year-old daughter.The attack took place during a raucous motorcycle rally on Sept. 29, 2013. The bikers became enraged because Mr. Lien, whose sport utility vehicle they had blocked off on the Henry Hudson Parkway, ran over one of them while trying to flee.""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" Mr. Sims said, beginning to weep. ""'I'm sorry' isn't enough.""""I never intended to hurt anybody,"" he went on. ""I folded under pressure, under emotion and I'm sorry. Six seconds of losing my composure.

He said Mr. Sims and the other bikers, including an undercover detective, had turned into an angry mob.

Judge Defies Gay Marriage Law:   [National Desk ],,"TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- In a dramatic show of defiance toward the federal judiciary, Chief Justice Roy S. Moore of the Alabama Supreme Court on Sunday night ordered the state's probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to gay couples on Monday, the day same-sex marriages were expected to begin here.""Effective immediately, no probate judge of the State of Alabama nor any agent or employee of any Alabama probate judge shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent"" with the Alabama Constitution or state law, the chief justice wrote in his order.The order, coming just hours before the January decisions of United States District Court Judge Callie V. S. Granade were scheduled to take effect, was almost certainly going to thrust this state into legal turmoil. It was not immediately clear how the state's 68 probate judges, who, like Chief Justice Moore, are popularly elected, would respond to the order.Since Judge Granade moved last month to declare Alabama's prohibitions against same-sex marriage unconstitutional, the chief justice has insisted that the probate judges were not required to abide by her decisions. But, in an interview on Wednesday, he said he thought he could do little more than guide the probate judges on how to respond.""I think I've done what I can do: advise the state court probate judges that they're not bound by any ruling of the Federal District Court,"" he said.But by Sunday night, the chief justice, faced with the prospect of many judges allowing same-sex marriages to move forward, acted, in part, ""to ensure the orderly administration of justice within the State of Alabama.""Reached by telephone late Sunday night, Ben Cooper, chairman of the board of the gay rights group Equality Alabama, said that same-sex couples expected to be issued marriage licenses Monday morning.""We are continuing to move forward tomorrow,"" Mr. Cooper said. ""If we walk in and licenses are refused, if they do not comply with the federal order, then these probate judges could be personally liable,"" said Mr. Cooper, who added that he expected legal actions to be filed against the individual probate judges if they do not issue the licenses.Some judges across the state had already signaled they would do nothing to aid gay couples and, in some instances, any couples. ""Marriage licenses and ceremonies are no longer available at the Pike County Probate Office,"" the office said.And Washington County Probate Judge Nick Williams released a ""declaration in support of marriage"" in which he said he would ""only issue marriage licenses and solemnize ceremonies consistent with Alabama law and the U.S. Constitution; namely, between one man and one woman only, so help me God.""Several judges elsewhere announced variations of those plans after a push by Chief Justice Moore, who rose to national prominence in the early 2000s when he defied a federal judge's order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from a Montgomery building and was subsequently ousted from his post leading the high court. He staged a political comeback, became chief justice again in 2013, and has in recent weeks said that Alabama's probate judges are not bound by a federal trial court's decisions. His argument has deep resonance in a place where a governor, George Wallace, stood in a doorway of the University of Alabama in 1963 in an unsuccessful bid to block its federally ordered integration.Although much has changed from Wallace's era, Chief Justice Moore had used a series of strongly worded letters and memorandums to insist that Judge Granade, an appointee of President George W. Bush who joined the federal bench in 2002, had instigated a grave breach of law.The result had been a legal and cultural debate rife with overtones of history, closely held religious beliefs and a chronically bubbling mistrust of the federal government that was expected to play out at Alabama's courthouses Monday.""I didn't start this,"" Chief Justice Moore said last week of the controversy. ""This was a federal court case pushed on our state.""Judge Granade has signaled that she expects probate judges to carry out her decisions, and judges, before the chief justice's order, had often said they would.""With all due respect to Chief Justice Moore, he's on the Alabama Supreme Court, and he's not a federal judge,"" said Alan L. King, a probate judge in Jefferson County, said last week.The chief justice's misgivings speak to widespread concerns here about federal overreach and same-sex marriage in Alabama, where about 81 percent of voters in 2006 supported a constitutional amendment banning gay nuptials. Few here doubt the force of his belief that Judge Granade's orders hold only ""persuasive authority,"" and not binding power, on Alabama judges.""My guess is that is actually the way Roy Moore sincerely understands the federal-state relationship,"" said Joseph Smith, a judicial politics expert at the University of Alabama. ""He's also an elected politician, and he knows who his constituency is.""So he has for now turned his words against Judge Granade.""She can't order them to recognize the unconstitutionality of the Sanctity of Marriage Amendment by her views,"" the chief justice said in a telephone interview during which he quoted Alabama statutes verbatim and resisted comparisons to Wallace.Despite Chief Justice Moore's protests, some analysts see parallels between his arguments now and those Wallace advanced in his own time.""It's a very similar strain of ideology: the state's rights, resisting the national tide, resisting liberal movements in policy,"" Dr. Smith said.Some legal scholars say that the chief justice may be correct in his interpretation of the immediate scope of the federal court's rulings and how they apply to the probate judges. But his eagerness in pronouncing his views unnerved some in Alabama who feared that it might stir local judges to resist Judge Granade.""I don't want to see judges make the same mistakes that I think were made in this state 50 years ago, where you have state officials not abiding by federal orders,"" said Judge Steven L. Reed of Montgomery County, who added, ""The legacy always hangs over us until we show that we're beyond it.""But there had been only limited talk of plans for sweeping defiance by probate judges, including those who say that same-sex marriages conflict with their religious views. In Geneva County, Judge Fred Hamic said Wednesday he would issue licenses to gay couples but that they would have to go somewhere else to wed. ""I believe I would be partaking in a sin, and I sin every day, don't get me wrong,"" he said. ""This is one sin I do not have to participate in, not that you have to participate in any sin.""For many here, it is unsurprising that Chief Justice Moore emerged as a strident voice in a social debate after the dispute about the Ten Commandments display, known as ""Roy's Rock,"" forced him from power.""Unfortunately, sometimes it makes for very good politics here to be seen as opposing federal intervention, whether it's from a court or a federal agency,"" said David G. Kennedy, who represents two women involved in a case that prompted Judge Granade's decision. ""The situation here is that this is not federal intervention. It's not federal intervention at all. What it is, is a federal court declaring what same-sex couples' rights are under the federal Constitution.""",0.0
"European Leaders Debate Aid to Ukraine, but Not Russia's Transgressions:   [Editorial ]",,"MUNICH -- It was at the venerable Munich Security Conference in 2007 that Vladimir Putin first sounded the resentful Cold War blast that now defines his foreign policy, bitterly accusing the United States of seeking a monopoly on global power. Subsequent Munich conferences were marked by desultory efforts to ""reset"" the relationship, to maintain the appearance at least of collegiality. All that was before Ukraine.At the security conference this past weekend in a bitterly cold Bavarian capital, the talk in the hall packed with generals, defense ministers, lawmakers and senior politicians was not of Russia's place in a European security order. It was about whether to send lethal arms to Ukraine to counter the military assistance that Russia supplies -- and blandly denies supplying -- to rebels in the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.Although the deterioration in relations with Russia has been obvious for some time, the hostility on display in Munich was still striking, even shocking, to many Russia hands and veterans of such conferences. One Russian participant said she got chills listening to some of the speeches.States bordering on Russia were referred to as ""front-line states."" The familiar litany of self-pity and it's-all-Washington's-doing from Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov -- once a friend to many in the hall -- drew bursts of derisive laughter. And when a Russian legislator regarded as pro-Western tried to argue that Western views of Ukraine were superficial, Senator Lindsey Graham, who with Senators John McCain and Bob Corker was part of a chorus of hawkish Republican lawmakers at the conference -- brusquely dismissed his comments.This was the stormy background against which Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, opened what many see as an 11th-hour effort to negotiate an end to the fighting in Ukraine. Perhaps more important for her, she was also trying to forestall growing calls in the United States to start supplying defensive but lethal arms to Ukraine.""The progress that Ukraine needs cannot be achieved by more weapons,"" Ms. Merkel said again and again at the Munich conference. It is also the message she pressed during her visit to Washington on Monday.Ms. Merkel addressed the security conference on Saturday, the day after she and President François Hollande of France, her partner in the negotiating initiative, had held talks in Kiev and Moscow. They and the leaders of Russia and Ukraine are tentatively scheduled to meet next in Minsk on Wednesday for what is expected to be the decisive moment of their current mission.Details of what's on the table are not known, and Ms. Merkel acknowledged that success was far from certain. But Senator Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, was not particularly receptive in his response: The chancellor, he said, was blocking America from giving Ukraine the arms it needs.That is not the position of President Obama, and Secretary of State John Kerry fervently sought to persuade the conference that ""there is no division, there is no split"" between the United States and Germany on how to deal with Russia over Ukraine. Mr. Obama repeated that formulation on Monday after meeting with Ms. Merkel at the White House, but pointedly left the idea of lethal assistance on the table.The United States is currently committed to provide training and nonlethal equipment (body armor and the like), and Mr. Obama has not shown enthusiasm for providing the communications equipment and arms to counter Russian artillery and radar that President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine is seeking.The debate, however, which continued in the corridors and beer halls, goes beyond Ukraine's military needs. On the eve of the meeting, a group of former ambassadors to NATO and Ukraine issued a report declaring that Ukraine represented the most serious security threat to the West since the Cold War. The West had to be prepared to send lethal assistance to Ukraine, they argued, both ""to support Ukraine and to push back against Russia's unacceptable challenge to the postwar European security order.""Ms. Merkel's deeply held counterargument, based on her roots in East Germany, is that East-West conflicts cannot be resolved militarily, and that if one negotiating approach fails, then another must be tried.A more pragmatic argument against lethal assistance is that Ukraine and its military, in their utterly devastated state, are in no shape to deploy sophisticated weapons. A stronger argument is that Mr. Putin would actually welcome an escalation since it would confirm his claim that the United States is pulling Kiev's strings, and since his army could easily overcome any increase in Ukrainian military capability.These debates will not be resolved anytime soon. But, however sore Mr. Lavrov may be at his drubbing in Munich, he would do his country a favor by reporting to his president that there was no debate in Munich this time about how Mr. Putin and his aggressive policies are perceived in the West.Graph Graphic",0.0
Congress Rethinks the Cuba Embargo:   [Editorial ],,"In 1962, the year Bob Dylan released his first album, Marilyn Monroe died of an overdose and Nelson Mandela was imprisoned, the American government began imposing an economic embargo on Cuba in an effort to subvert Fidel Castro.Over the decades, American presidents and lawmakers have stiffened and at times loosened the embargo. Yet, the web of laws and regulations enacted in a failed attempt to change the regime in Havana through coercive means remains largely frozen in time.With the United States and Cuba restoring diplomatic relations, a significant majority of Americans and an overwhelming majority of Cubans want the embargo repealed. It is time for Congress to help make engagement the cornerstone of American policy toward Cuba.A growing number of lawmakers from both parties have taken promising steps in that direction in recent weeks. Representatives Tom Emmer, Republican of Minnesota, and Kathy Castor, Democrat of Florida, introduced a bill in the House last week that would lift the embargo. Earlier last month, the Senate Appropriations Committee passed amendments that would allow American citizens to travel to Cuba freely and ease some commercial interactions.""The embargo has benefited the Castro regime and hurt the Cuban people,"" said Representative Emmer. ""We've given it plenty of time.""Despite the executive actions the Obama administration has taken, Cuba continues to face some of the stiffest American sanctions. It is the only country United States citizens are barred from visiting as tourists. The chief executive of Marriott International, Arne Sorenson, who recently visited Cuba for the first time, is among those arguing that the embargo is putting American companies at an unreasonable disadvantage. Foreign businesses are rushing to get a foothold in the Cuban market ""to leave as little as possible for American business when the restrictions are lifted altogether,"" Mr. Sorenson said in a statement.Spurred by the same concern, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced a bill in February that would allow regular commerce with Cuba. ""What is going to happen is Americans are going to flock to Cuba, they're going to be staying in Spanish hotels, eating German food and using Chinese computers,"" she said.For years, Cuban-American lawmakers, who continue to champion the embargo, have dominated policy toward Cuba. Historically, other politicians largely deferred to them because many were less invested in the issue and some feared that taking an anti-embargo position would alienate Cuban-American voters.Any lawmaker who remains on the fence on the matter should consider the dramatic change in public opinion. A Pew Research Center poll released on July 21 showed that 72 percent of Americans support ending the embargo against Cuba, up from 66 percent in January. While Democrats support President Obama's effort to normalize relations with Cuba by a wider margin than Republicans, support among the latter is rising. The survey found that 55 percent of conservative Republicans favor ending the embargo, up from 40 percent in January.Two leading Republican presidential candidates, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, have been critical of Mr. Obama's decision. A recent poll commissioned by Univision suggests that this position could hurt them with a key constituency, Latino voters. The survey found that 34 percent of prospective Latino voters would favor a candidate who continued Mr. Obama's Cuba policy, while 14 percent said the opposite. Among Cuban-Americans, 40 percent said they would back a candidate who favors normalizing relations, while 26 percent said they would not.Hillary Rodham Clinton made a forceful appeal to end the embargo in a speech in Miami on Friday, noting that Cubans want broader contact with the United States. ""They want to buy our goods, read our books, surf our web and learn from our people,"" she said. ""That is the road toward democracy and dignity, and we should walk it together.""",0.0
U.S. and China Proclaim Progress in Their Trade Talks:   [Business/Financial Desk ] [1 ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. GUANGZHOU, China -- In their first top-level trade talks since President Obama hosted China's leader in September, the United States and China said on Monday that they had made progress on sticking points, including preventing the theft of trade secrets and opening the Chinese market more broadly to American multinationals.Still, the lack of larger breakthroughs on bigger issues -- like negotiations for a broad trade deal -- contrasted with America's improving economic ties with the rest of Asia.The two countries have been eyeing each other cautiously.Mr. Obama has been trying to strengthen relations in the region, through deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which lowers trade barriers between the United States and several other Asian nations. But the deal excludes China.President Xi Jinping is pushing for China, with its newfound financial muscle, to play a greater role in the global economy. But his sometimes nationalistic stance has squeezed Western multinationals operating in China.Two days of trade talks in this southern port city yielded modest commitments from China to address some issues.Officials agreed to extend better legal protections to American companies that have lost trade secrets to theft, including clarifying their ability to seek preliminary injunctions in Chinese courts. They also made progress on opening the Chinese market wider to American manufacturers of drugs and medical devices, specifically easing the path to clinical trials.China also appeared to step back further from regulations that were proposed this year -- but shelved -- that would have encouraged its huge banking sector to favor locally made technology and communication products.""We're tackling these issues in a fairly open, frank and candid manner that I think is allowing us to make progress,"" Penny Pritzker, the commerce secretary of the United States, said on Monday in an interview after the annual talks, which have been held since the 1980s and are known as the United States-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade.Given the often-technical nature of the negotiations between the United States and China, ""the expectations weren't real high,"" said Myron Brilliant, the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who was here for the talks. ""But it was important that the forum addressed issues raised by Obama and Xi."">China is on track this year to surpass Canada as the biggest single trading partner of the United States. But as trade has ballooned in recent years, tensions have grown. China sells far more goods to the United States than it buys, resulting in a Chinese trade surplus with the United States of $218 billion in the first 10 months of this year.Despite an overall slump in China's exports and imports this year, Chinese factories continue to do brisk business selling goods to Americans. China's merchandise exports to the United States rose 5.2 percent in the first 10 months of the year to a record $340 billion, according to Chinese customs data. China's overall exports, by contrast, have declined 2.5 percent over the same period.American companies as varied as soybean farms and shampoo manufacturers are also making fast progress in tapping the rapidly changing Chinese consumer market. Matthew Price, the greater China chairman of Procter & Gamble, noted in a speech Sunday to American and Chinese business leaders on the sidelines of the trade talks how Chinese women on average use more skin moisturizers than their American counterparts. More than a third of the company's sales in China take place online, compared with only about 10 percent in the United States, he added.Among the more controversial issues in the trade relationship have been Beijing's many limits on foreign services companies, which in America contribute the biggest share of economic output.For example, China this year has raised hackles among Western tech companies, many of whose services are blocked in the country, by asking them to hand over source code as one of several measures to ensure their products remain ""secure and controllable."" Those companies fear that phrase could be very broadly defined by the Chinese government.On the Chinese side, officials want broader access to acquisitions in the United States, especially when it comes to American regulatory treatment of China's tens of thousands of state-owned enterprises. Of particular concern to the Chinese has been the transparency of the review process for deals carried out by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which involves many government agencies and is led by the Treasury Department.Zhang Xiangchen, the deputy China international trade representative at China's ministry of commerce, said on Monday after the talks that the United States and China hoped to expand trade, but obstacles remained.""China's investments in the U.S. are subject to some barriers, such as uncertain and untransparent security checks,"" Mr. Zhang said. ""On the other hand, the U.S. hopes China can open up its market more. Both these concerns are legitimate.""Beyond the services sector, another area of intense American interest has been greater access to the Chinese market for American agricultural products, and seeking greater clarity on the regulatory and scientific standards that Beijing imposes on imports.Despite lobbying here by American officials, including Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, China appeared ready to give little immediate ground on this issue.""We need to be open to importing advanced technology and enriching the variety of food offered to the people,"" Wang Yang, the vice premier in charge of trade issues who led the Chinese delegation, said at a briefing on Sunday.""At the same time, we must protect the interests of our 700 million farmers,"" Mr. Wang added. ""In recent years, our agricultural costs have been rising, but prices have hit a ceiling caused by the decline in international commodity prices. We face a lot of challenges in terms of how to increase farmers' incomes and achieve sustainable agricultural development.""Ms. Pritzker said that, in response to concerns raised by Mr. Wang, the United States would revise how it handles controls on exports to China of civilian technologies it now deems delicate.""We have agreed to develop a mechanism to improve the exchange of information on individual cases of commercial high-tech items exported to China,"" Ms. Pritzker said.",0.0
2 Daughters of the Bronx Share More Than a Name:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"The sounds of summer drifted through the air on the Bronx side of the High Bridge, from the squeals of children running along sun-dappled paths to the slaps of flip-flops hitting the pavement as boys with towels slung over their shoulders walked to the public swimming pool on the Manhattan side. Two women chatting on a bench stopped midsentence as two other women, smiling and familiar looking, ambled past.""Ay!"" one of the women on the bench exclaimed. ""Sonia! Que linda!""Actually, both of the smiling women were named Sonia: Justice Sonia Sotomayor of the Supreme Court and Sonia Manzano, the actress who played Maria on ""Sesame Street"" before announcing recently that she was retiring from the show. This kind of encounter happens every summer in the Bronx, as these two women with boldface names return to the borough of their childhood to reconnect, give back and -- in this case -- enjoy the view of the recently reopened High Bridge, New York City's original High Line. They don't need to trumpet that they're from the block: Chances are, sooner or later, you just might see them on your block.For years, the two Sonias have headlined the Bronx Children's Museum's annual ""Dream Big"" event, a summer celebration for an institution that is set to finally move into a brick-and-mortar home in 2017. And while both women get more requests for public and charitable appearances than they could ever oblige, their dedication to the children of the Bronx is not charity, but a duty born of personal experience.Justice Sotomayor likes to say that you can't dream about what you don't know exists. In her world -- she grew up in the Bronxdale Houses, which now bear her name -- she aspired to the law while watching ""Perry Mason."" Now, she hopes to cast a similar spell on a few youngsters. After this year's museum event, at Fordham University last month, she and Ms. Manzano headed to the High Bridge for a brief tour with the city engineers who helped to restore it.""If kids don't know the possibilities, they can't dream,"" Justice Sotomayor said in an interview after the tour. ""They certainly can't dream bigger than the circumscribed world they're in. Unless I bring that to them, this new world I inhabit, they may never know the different things they can aspire to. To me, if being on the Supreme Court has any meaning, my legacy is to touch enough kids that some of them will feel inspired to do more than they know about today.""Justice Sotomayor, who lives in Washington, said she returns to New York every six to eight weeks, pulled back by the many friends and family members who still live here. That, too, attests to a lesson she learned as a child in the Bronx.""Everywhere I lived in the Bronx growing up, it was community, people knew each other,"" she said. ""People helped each other in need, like when my father died and everyone in the building came up to say something to us. It's community. To me, the Bronx has always meant that. It's a place where I grew up and where I learned the value of that extended family.""Among her extended family is Ms. Manzano, whose presence on ""Sesame Street"" for 44 years made her part of many people's childhood memories. She looks forward to seeing Justice Sotomayor at the museum's celebration, which highlights its summer arts program.In turn, the museum's heightened visibility -- thanks to the support of the two Sonias and others -- helped it secure the $9.6 million needed for the design and construction of its new home. Ms. Manzano recently wrote a children's book about the bridge and donated the profits to the museum, which offers much-needed activities.""I remember being so bored in the Bronx when I was a kid because there was nothing to do,"" said Ms. Manzano, who spent part of her childhood in the South Bronx, not far from where Justice Sotomayor lived. ""Sitting at the window for hours at a time, envying the shoeshine boys because they were allowed out of the house. This is an opportunity to address something I remember clearly as a drag, not having anything to do up there. It's natural for me to want to go back.""Few people noticed the two Sonias as they crossed the bridge -- although William Cantine, 26, managed to grab a selfie with the justice, who graduated from Cardinal Spellman High School, just as he had. Justice Sotomayor joked about wearing comfortable shoes, pointing to Ms. Manzano, who wore blue and chrome ""space heels"" that looked like a cross between slippers and shiny levers capable of launching her across the Harlem River.Justice Sotomayor asked the engineers earnest questions about what had been done to upgrade the 19th-century infrastructure during the renovation. She admitted that as proud as she was of the Bronx, she did not remember hearing much about the High Bridge in the 1970s (when she was busy attending Princeton and, later, Yale Law School).""Hopefully, for the next generation of kids it will be the place to get engaged,"" she said. ""Others will have their first kiss and others will find it a place to share.""And maybe a few of them will even return one day to tell the next generation about love, duty and the Bronx.Photograph (Photograph by David Gonzalez/the New York Times)",0.0
Animal Thought as Not-So-Wild Idea:   [Science Desk ],,"Given the subtitle of Carl Safina's fascinating and expansive new book, ""Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel,"" it's no surprise that Dr. Safina frequently discusses animal cognition.The surprise is that he also talks about animal precognition. (Read an excerpt.)""How do we explain certain remarkable stories about elephant communication?"" he asks at one point, noting that a conservationist who has worked with the animals for decades flatly believes in pachyderm telepathy. The conservationist says she has seen free-living elephants in Kenya show up at a nearby reserve just before rescued orphans were scheduled to arrive, ready to meet and greet.""I filed her claim in my mind's 'unlikely stories' bin,"" Dr. Safina acknowledges. ""But that bin gets cluttered; there are many 'unlikely' stories about elephants.""And not just elephants: In a chapter cheekily titled ""Woo-Woo,"" he entertains similar ideas about the psychic abilities of killer whales and other members of the dolphin family.Dr. Safina, a marine conservationist and professor at Stony Brook University on Long Island, is clearly unafraid to challenge scientific orthodoxy. He accepts as a given that animals are capable of thought and emotion, a proposition that, as he notes impatiently and not a little defensively, is far from settled among animal behaviorists.""Why do researchers judge the mental performance of other animals against a standard that humans could not possibly reach?"" he asks. ""You have to deeply deny the evidence to conclude that humans alone are conscious, feeling beings.""This renegade spirit is a source of the book's great charm, the pepper in its woo-woo sauce. Dr. Safina takes frequent droll pleasure in puncturing claims to human exceptionalism.""Maybe more than anything, what 'makes us human' is our ability to generate wacky ideas,"" he writes. And at another point: ""There is in nature an overriding sanity and often, in humankind, an undermining insanity. We, among all animals, are most frequently irrational, distortional, delusional, worried.""Dr. Safina is a terrific writer, majestic and puckish in equal measure, with a contagious enthusiasm for the complex social lives of the animals he's observing -- in this book, chiefly elephants, wolves and killer whales. If he pulls a bit of bait and switch, for long stretches abandoning his supposed theme of animal consciousness to focus instead on simple appreciation and advocacy, it's hard to object because he brings his subjects so vividly to life.Here he is, for instance, describing killer whales as they forage for salmon off Vancouver Island in British Columbia: ""Several whales bow their backs and dive steeply. Below, the fish have their attention. A couple of other whales slice rapidly through the surface, quickly switching directions.""""The closest whale, right behind us, is L-92. This big one over here with the high, wavy dorsal fin is K-25. He begins a series of high-arcing lunges, with lots of splashing and commotion. He's after one large, isolated fish. He dives away. When he suddenly bursts through the surface, his mass and momentum startle me wide-eyed.""The effect -- and surely the intention -- of such lively, physical description is to make Dr. Safina's readers feel as strong a connection to these animals as he does. Again and again he follows the same formula, familiar from nature documentaries: Draw close to the animals, explain their habits and family structures and personalities until we perceive them as individual characters, then detail the ways human culture is destroying their way of life.For elephants, that means ivory poaching; for wolves, the threat of hunters and trappers; for killer whales, everything from overfishing to underwater military explosions to the continued practice, in some places, of capturing young whales for use in aquarium shows.The strategy of making us see animals as individuals is undeniably effective, as anybody who has followed the story of Cecil the lion can attest. And Dr. Safina draws out haunting resonances between animal lives and our own. ""What I had not imagined,"" he writes of a Yellowstone wolf pack that fractured after hunters killed its alpha member, ""was the politics involved, the personalities, the vendettas and coalitions, the family turmoil following tragedy, the loyalties and disloyalties."" Dr. Safina describes the drama as ""all too human.""In the same section, he describes a legendary wolf from Yellowstone, the ""superwolf"" known by his tracking number 21, who never lost a fight and never killed an opponent.""Can a wolf be magnanimous?"" Dr. Safina asks. ""And if so, why?""But of course the nobility of animals is all a matter of perspective: Ask harbor seals how they feel about killer whales. And as persuasive as Dr. Safina is in calling for humans to tread more humanely on the earth -- his desire for ecological harmony sometimes carries pleasing echoes of the poet Gary Snyder -- ""Beyond Words"" remains most interesting when it focuses on the core question of nonhuman consciousness.That question also leads him to the most scientifically grounded sections of the book, discussing for example the chemical and neurological bases of emotions: ""Oxytocin drives bonding,"" he reminds readers, ""and it makes elephants and many other species act social or sexual. Block the hormone; many mammals and birds lose interest in socializing, pairing, nesting and contact."" Elsewhere he writes about brain size relative to body size, and the role of neuron density in determining mental dexterity.Throughout, he demonstrates a keen grasp of the scientific literature across a range of disciplines and a refreshing skepticism about the terms of debate. ""Only humans have human minds,"" he concedes. ""But believing that only humans have minds is like believing that because only humans have human skeletons, only humans have skeletons.""Finally, though, you get the feeling that for Dr. Safina, human consciousness is at least as pressing a concern as animal consciousness, and possibly more in doubt. ""The work,"" he writes near the end of this captivating book, ""is beautiful, and urgent, an almost holy quest for deeper intimacy. Not just with the whales. With the world.""Photograph Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel. By Carl Safina. Henry Holt and Co. 461 Pages. $32.",0.0
Hitting All the High Notes in Munich:   [The Arts/Cultural Desk ],,"MUNICH -- A bunch of hippies partying, then mourning, in a shadowy gray landscape. A stories-high crucifix propped ominously against a wall. A stark black stage outlined in neon white. A gyrating crowd of shirtless cowboys.When you see a great deal of opera in a short period of time, the performances sometimes start to bleed into one another, their details blurring. (Were those leather trench coats in ""Traviata"" or ""Turandot""? Did that soprano sing Mimi or Marguerite?) But over a few days spent at the Bavarian State Opera here recently, there was no mistaking any of the four productions I saw for any of the others. Each was distinctive, each indelible, each an inventive response to the work at hand. Each had a point of view.This mini-marathon, a taste of the annual five-week Munich Opera Festival that ended on Friday, confirmed impressions formed by previous visits, Internet simulcasts and word of mouth: No company manages the delicate balance of contemporary opera -- simultaneously maintaining high musical standards, attracting the finest singers and experimenting dramatically -- better than this one. Its festival, a mix of brand-new productions, stagings from the past season and immaculately cast revivals, has become perhaps the most dependably, densely exciting presentation of opera in the world.While under Peter Jonas, its director from 1993 until 2006, the State Opera broadened its repertory -- embracing the Baroque, especially -- and became more theatrically adventurous, it has truly come into its own under Nikolaus Bachler, in charge since 2008. A fixture in his parterre box above the orchestra pit, Mr. Bachler is unavoidable: If you're looking at the stage, chances are he's in your line of vision, too.In the late 1990s, when Mr. Bachler led the Volksoper in Vienna, one of the staff conductors was a young talent in his 20s named Kirill Petrenko. Over the subsequent decade, Mr. Petrenko began to rise swiftly through the profession, with positions at the opera house in Meiningen, Germany, and then the Komische Oper in Berlin, along with increasingly prominent guest stints at operas and orchestras around the world.A consummate showman, Mr. Bachler scored a coup by attracting his old colleague to Munich, and Mr. Petrenko started as music director here in 2013. That Mr. Petrenko was recently named chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, arguably the most prominent post in classical music, solidified Mr. Bachler's status as a kingmaker, or at least as a leader with exceptionally good, and prescient, taste. (That taste will cost him a conductor sooner than he probably wanted: Mr. Petrenko's contract here lasts just three more years, though efforts are underway to negotiate an extension before he devotes himself fully to Berlin.)Since he's spending the summer conducting Wagner's ""Ring"" cycle at the Bayreuth Festival, Mr. Petrenko was not in the pit for any of the performances I saw here. And, in fact, the conducting was the weakest part of the four evenings -- never disastrous, but also never the draw.Christopher Moulds fared best leading a small, crisp yet lyrical Baroque band in David Bösch's tenderly melancholy production of Monteverdi's ""Orfeo,"" new last summer and starring Christian Gerhaher. But Alain Altinoglu, in ""Manon Lescaut,"" didn't bring sufficient nuance to Puccini's thick orchestral textures, and Asher Fisch, in Verdi's ""Don Carlo,"" lacked grandeur. Leo Hussain adroitly followed the singers in Tchaikovsky's ""Eugene Onegin,"" but struggled to keep a firm hold on some swiftly shifting ensembles.These were showcases for singers and directors, not conductors. ""Onegin,"" in particular, fielded what might well be the best cast for that opera possible today: Anna Netrebko (sounding even more secure and voluptuous as Tatiana than she did at the Metropolitan Opera two years ago), Mariusz Kwiecien, Pavol Breslik and Günther Groissböck. All were in rich voice and passionately committed to Krzysztof Warlikowski's wrenching 2007 production.His staging has become known as a ""Brokeback Mountain"" take on the opera, not an entirely unfair characterization. Mr. Warlikowski clearly identifies the title character with Tchaikovsky, who agonized over his homosexuality; the breach between Onegin (Mr. Kwiecien, fervent) and his friend Lenski (Mr. Breslik, incisive) arises here from a love that only barely dares -- in this early-1970s provincial setting --speak its name.Their deadly duel is in this version a botched sex scene and is truly the opera's pivot point, setting off a nightmarish psychological descent for Onegin, who imagines himself falling more and more out of control of his desires. (That's where the seductively dancing cowboys come in.) The character's final appeal to Tatiana is even more desperate than usual, a last-ditch plea from the depths of the closet.Ms. Netrebko's participation was another of Mr. Bachler's coups, a victory snatched from the jaws of defeat. She had been scheduled last fall for the premiere of the ""Manon Lescaut"" production, but dropped out after clashing with the director, Hans Neuenfels. Inserted instead into these festival performances of ""Onegin,"" she was replaced as Manon, in November and this summer, by Kristine Opolais, a detailed, ardent actress with a soprano that's clean but bodiless and colorless, a pencil drawing in lieu of a painting. Her Des Grieux, sung by the tenor Jonas Kaufmann, was the real star here, his tone dark-hued and stormy; as her brother, Lescaut, the baritone Markus Eiche sang with scowling intensity.The production was less inspired. While Mr. Neuenfels has in the past produced precise, multilayered stagings, like Wagner's ""Lohengrin"" as a rat-filled experiment at the Bayreuth Festival, his ""Manon Lescaut"" shows signs of uncertainty. At first he seems to be indicting society's obsession with acquisition and its degradation of women: The chorus is a mass of flame-haired, pear-shaped grotesques; piles of jewels sparkle on a nearly bare stage; and the cataloguing of female criminals is a severe, sobering affair.Perhaps Ms. Opolais's Manon was a bit more depressive than usual in the first act, which is normally cheerful. But too often this felt like a standard-issue ""Lescaut,"" just with less furniture. There was no chill in the conception of the characters and situations to match the effectively icy sets.Less daring but more satisfying was Jürgen Rose's ""Don Carlo,"" with its looming crucifix, first seen here in 2000. Sometimes static, it nevertheless conjures the moodiness, the pervasive gloom, that this opera requires. Starring as the reluctant queen Elisabetta was the soprano Anja Harteros, who's become something of a house diva at the State Opera. (She is infamously prone to cancellations, but practically never in Munich.)Her voice attractively unsettled yet her sense of the musical line sustained, Ms. Harteros's Elisabetta was an intriguing mixture of strength and vulnerability, smoldering tone and hovering delicacy. Her fourth-act aria, ""Tu che le vanità,"" alternated between forcefully rhythmic passages and those that bend the line until time seems nearly to dissolve.As King Philip, René Pape was, as usual, commanding of voice and somehow detached, his outpouring in ""Ella giammai m'amò"" elegant but uninvolving. If the tenor Alfred Kim rarely veered from loudness as Carlo, his sound, at least, was shining. The young baritone Simone Piazzola, the production's Rodrigo, was a model of robust tone and sensitive phrasing.It wasn't perfect. Opera hardly ever is. But in Munich these days it comes closer, more consistently, than anywhere else I know.Photograph Feats of Casting: Anna Netrebko, Left, and Alisa Kolosova in Krzysztof Warlikowski's Production of Tchaikovsky's ""Eugen Onegin"" at the Munich Opera Festival.

"They May Be Neighbors, but They Don't Always Play Together:   [Review ]",,"With Japanese music still lingering in memory from the Juilliard School's weeklong, storm-abbreviated Focus! festival last month, the New York presenter Music From Japan strutted its stuff with its own festival over the weekend. In two programs at Asia Society, Music From Japan, long a force in opening pathways for Japanese music in the West, was also celebrating its 40th anniversary.A chamber concert on Sunday afternoon, presenting five works commissioned by the organization, two of them new, seemed virtually a continuation of the Focus! festival's exploration of Japanese music since 1945. But an intimate concert on Saturday evening, ""East Asian Vibrancy,"" plunged deep into the world of traditional instruments, which Focus! had mostly avoided, and expanded the range in both time and place, offering classical and contemporary music from Japan, China and South Korea.In a preconcert lecture-demonstration, Ralph Samuelson, a performer and scholar, spoke of the ""energetic musical life"" in those countries today but noted that ""traditional, folk and classical music are still there, alive and well."" As proof, the concert presented three noted performers on traditional instruments: Mayumi Miyata playing the Japanese sho, a mouth organ; Wu Man, the Chinese pipa, a pear-shaped lute; and Jin Hi Kim, the Korean komungo, a large, deep zitherlike instrument. Each performed something from her instrument's classical repertory and something contemporary.The solo demonstrations and performances were brilliant and fascinating, effectively staking out the individualities of the instruments. But you had to wonder how they would combine, in a sort of jam improvisation after intermission and in the premiere of Ned Rothenburg's ""Unkai"" (""Sea of Clouds""), which followed.Not always well, it turned out. The hyperactive pipa and the spacious komungo, as string instruments, made relative peace with each other, but the unearthly, reedy sho seemed hard put to enter the conversation.Michio Kitazume's ""Distances III,"" given its premiere on Sunday, was captivating. It played clarinet (Richard Stoltzman) against cello (Fred Sherry) in a shifting perspective, each instrument thrusting and receding. Dynamic contrasts suggested physical distance. Mr. Stoltzman's ultra-pianissimos, at the very limit of audibility, were particularly remarkable.Yoichi Sugiyama's ""Two Verses by Du Fu"" for voice, viola, clarinet and piano, was the other new work on Sunday. In English, it was elusive in its spare, angular melodies and slightly jarring in some fragmented phrasing. Wonjung Kim, a soprano, gave the songs a fine turn, as she did Joji Yuasa's melodious ""Oyasuminasai"" (""Good Night""), from 2013, with Stephen Gosling on piano.Mr. Gosling and Mr. Sherry anchored Ichiro Nodaira's ""Quatuor en Hiver"" (""Quartet in Winter""), from 2003, and the violinist Mari Kimura gave a stellar performance of Mari Takano's ""Full Moon"" (2008-9) over electronic tracks on which she also played.The Music From Japan festival will travel to the Freer Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington on Tuesday; musicfromjapan.org.Photograph Music From Japan: This Asia Society Festival Featured East Asian Instruments: From Left, the Pipa (China), Played by Wu Man; the Sho (Japan), Played by Mayumi Miyata; and the Komungo (Korea), Played by Jin Hi Kim.

Guesswork in Cashing In Delta's Miles:   [Business/Financial Desk ],,"For about a quarter-century, frequent-flier miles have represented a kind of magic for many consumers.You'd take a bunch of trips that you would have taken anyway and earn miles along the way. After a while, you'd earn a free flight. If you earned enough miles, you could spin the globe and travel to whatever point it stopped at.That feeling of possibility was priceless.But that magic was a trick. All along, those free seats were probably ones that the airlines weren't going to be able to fill with paying customers, so they were nearly free for the carriers to give away.Over the last 18 months, Delta Air Lines has been engaged in some sleight of hand of its own. The airline no longer posts any award chart explaining how many miles your free tickets will require, the way that United and American Airlines still do. But Delta also hasn't moved to a transparent miles redemption system that is based entirely on the cash price that the ""free"" ticket would otherwise cost, as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways do.Instead, Delta issues proclamations like this one that came along a few weeks ago: ""For travel on or after June 1, 2016, the number of miles needed will change based on destination, demand and other considerations. But most Award prices will remain unchanged.""Which destinations? How much demand? What other considerations? Which prices? The airline won't say. You're just supposed to cross your fingers and hope that you have enough miles come vacation time or if you have to get to a funeral quickly. Or hope for some magic.If you fly Delta or any other airline more than a few times each year, you probably collect miles. Most redemptions that people make are for free tickets in the United States. As a result, even the most casual participants have long anchored their expectations according to the following calculation: If you have 25,000 miles, you ought to be able to get that free round-trip ticket reasonably easily.But in recent years, a couple of things have changed. For one, airlines like JetBlue have moved away from rewarding people for distance traveled and toward giving out points based on what those customers paid.When it comes to redeeming those miles and points, it became clear that even the airlines that still encouraged that 25,000 mental redemption anchor weren't necessarily abiding by it. Perhaps that price would be available for a trip to El Paso in August at 6 a.m. on a Tuesday, but the round-trip flights most people really wanted would often require more miles.Delta customers have long complained about reward availability at the 25,000-mile level, and its executives freely acknowledge that airline consumers in general should abandon any sense of expectations around this fixed price. ""The 25,000-mile round-trip award fare that historically has been a standard for the airlines, I think you're going to see that completely change,"" Karen Zachary, who runs Delta's SkyMiles program, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in May.Ideally, you'd replace magic with math in the frequent-flier equation. But figuring out what a mile is worth requires knowing what flights will actually cost. And the only way to figure that out with Delta now is to try to actually book one in real time.Aside from the frequent travelers on the website FlyerTalk, which remains must-reading for consumers who want to do the math and decode the moves of Delta and other airlines, one of the carrier's biggest critics in recent months has been Gary Leff. Mr. Leff has a day job working as a chief financial officer at a university research center, but he spends his spare time running a service that helps people redeem their miles and blogging about loyalty programs. He has posted about Delta repeatedly.Delta does offer some free flights for less than 25,000 miles round-trip now. But Mr. Leff has done the math and has pointed out that the value you get per mile (when compared with the cash cost of the ticket) seems to rarely exceed two cents, an important figure that we'll come back to shortly. Also, free flights in business class to Australia on Delta (long one of the magic redemption destinations for mile hoarders industrywide) now sometimes cost 830,000 miles per ticket, multiples of the former price.The lack of clear predictable pricing irks Mr. Leff, even as it may help drive more people to his award-booking service. ""I think Delta is not telling the truth, at a macro level, about the direction they're taking the program,"" he said. ""And they're making it harder for members to understand what their miles are worth.""I tried to get a Delta spokesman, Anthony Black, to address Mr. Leff's truthiness point squarely, but I failed to get much that was new other than a link to a list of low-cost redemption opportunities. Delta seems to think that no award chart should be necessary given that so many people redeem their miles for domestic tickets that only have a few different prices anyway. But if that's the case, why not offer a permanent list of the range of possibilities for each market and explain what the rough odds are of actually getting the cheaper rates? Yes, consumers are used to unpredictable cash prices when they pay with their own money. But mileage programs were built on a different system of expectations, and people have saved those miles, often for years, accordingly.United and American customers who are aware of Delta's moves are worried that those carriers will follow suit. ""We won't comment on any such changes, planned or otherwise,"" said Rahsaan Johnson, a United spokesman. That's not exactly encouraging. At least American's representative, Laura Nedbal, said that the carrier planned no changes to its award chart, albeit with the now-standard ""at this time"" disclaimer. ""We are always watching the competitive environment, and we'll make sure AAdvantage is positioned as an industry-leading loyalty program,"" she added.Many of you are more or less stuck with your airline. With just a handful of big carriers left, there may be only one reasonable alternative for decent flight times where you live, or perhaps your employer forces you to fly one airline.Plenty of people, however, earn many of their miles off the plane, by putting all of their spending on credit cards that earn miles. If you're disgusted with Delta or worried about other carriers, then it's probably time to switch to a credit card that offers cash back or its own proprietary reward points worth a guaranteed 2 cents for every dollar you spend. Delta miles probably won't be worth that much if you're redeeming them for domestic plane tickets. I wrote a column in May that describes all of these cards in detail.There are some exceptions here. For now, you can still redeem Delta miles with its international partners for reasonable sums. That could change, but until it does, those redemptions offer good value if you can earn enough miles and have the flexibility to fly when the free seats are available. And all of the credit card issuers that have partnerships with airlines, knowing that the value of the mile is almost certainly in decline, have started offering other goodies in recent years that may be attractive to some customers. Those goodies include free bag checking or the ability to board the plane in the fourth group instead of the seventh and actually find room in the overhead bins for your bag.American Express issues the Delta credit cards, and when I asked the card company whether it thought the value of Delta miles had increased, decreased or stayed the same over the last two years, it refused to answer. That tells you all you need to know, doesn't it?In Mr. Leff's eyes, Delta and the other carriers have made a point to slowly change redemptions so that people are no longer getting outsize value from their miles when they want or need it most. The magic, in other words, is seeping out of the system. ""Most people are no longer getting the leverage out of the programs that made them special,"" he said. ""They've turned them into rebate programs, almost like a punch card.""You probably would make changes like this, too, if you were an airline executive. Many of them rue the day in 1981 when American Airlines introduced its frequent-flier program and they resent the consumer entitlement that resulted, even if airlines did take for granted the loyalty that the programs fostered for so long. Shareholders have no problem with stinginess and opacity either, as long as it doesn't drive customers away and the planes stay as full as they have been of late.As for all of the people who no longer get anywhere near the value they once did from their miles, at least there's this bit of magic left: It is still amazing that you can close your eyes in a metal tube in Los Angeles and wake up close to Sydney, even if it takes many hundreds of thousands of frequent-flier miles to get there for free.Make the most of your money.

Evaluating Military and Moral Fallout of Atomic Bomb:   [Foreign Desk ],,"Did the United States have to drop the bomb?Seventy years after the United States launched the atomic age with attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, hastening the end of the war in the Pacific, The New York Times asked readers how they viewed the decision by President Harry S. Truman.At the time, Truman defended his decision to drop the bombs as the only way to avoid a full-scale invasion of Japan. That, arguably, would have cost more lives, American and Japanese, than the approximately 200,000 who died in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.The anniversary of the Nagasaki attack will be commemorated at the city's Peace Park on Sunday with a ceremony that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will attend.Critics have contended that the Japanese were sending signals that they were prepared to surrender, but that these were either missed or ignored, and that the United States wanted to demonstrate to the world -- particularly the Soviet Union -- the awesome power it had at its disposal.We received thousands of responses, including justifications, condemnations, indictments and explanations. And though the 70 years since the bombings have helped provide perspective -- and more historical knowledge about what was happening at that time in the war -- they have not yielded much consensus.Here are excerpts from selected responses, lightly edited for clarity.Judging Truman's LegacyThis was an act of terrorism against the civilian population to achieve a political objective, a quintessential war crime. Harry Truman was a war criminal.-- LAWRENCE MOSS; N.Y., N.Y.>Truman did the right thing. Whether it saved Japanese lives is immaterial, it was politically correct and saved American lives and ended the war.-- FRANK DOOLITTLE; Paradise Valley, Ariz.>Dropping the bombs was a 1945 decision not a 2015 one. To Truman, 200,000 Japanese lives lost was better than 400,000 killed and wounded American lives. To add to that were the billions of dollars spent on developing the bomb and the means to deliver it, the B-29. If the bomb were not dropped and lives were lost, why was the bomb even developed?-- EDWARD WYSOCKI; Bowie, Md.>Putting myself back in August 1945, the Axis powers had no hesitation in bombing, torturing and murdering anyone associated with the Allied cause. If I was in the Enola Gay on that morning, I believe I would have looked at it as just a real big bomb that might put a quick end to the war. Given the means to do it, I believe I would have dropped a bomb every day until the emperor himself said, ""Please, no more."" Good for President Truman: He did what was necessary to stomp out evil.-- GEORGE HERRINGTON; Carmel, Ind.>The display of power was necessary to ensure the security of Europe and Asia from the threat of a Soviet-instigated war in the aftermath of World War II. Further, the American electorate had a desire for revenge and so it was politically advantageous to drop the bomb. Finally, to imply that moral and rational behavior are the same in war as in peace is a gross simplification of events past.-- JORDAN HALL; Kent, England>Alternatives to the Atomic BombOne need only look at the casualty estimates of the planned invasion of Japan to see how horrific the alternative might have been. The decision to drop the bomb by the United States is tragic, and American officials should always mourn with the people of Japan. Without the unfortunate decision to drop the bomb, the war would have dragged on and the losses for both sides would have been catastrophic.-- ZACHARY HOFFMAN; Columbus, Ohio>I do not argue against dropping an atomic bomb to hasten the end of a terrible war, but I disagree with targeting Hiroshima, Nagasaki or any other urban area. Instead, the United States should have selected a remote location. This would have demonstrated the imposing power of the atomic bomb and the uselessness of the Japanese government continuing the war, while saving the lives of tens of thousands of civilians, many of whom suffered incredibly gruesome injuries.-- JOHN VANKAT; Flagstaff, Ariz.>Even if we accept that dropping the bomb was necessary to force Japan to surrender unconditionally, no one has ever adequately explained why we couldn't have had the same effect by dropping the first bomb on an uninhabited part of Japan. Even if Japan refused to surrender after the first bomb and we had had to drop the second, as happened in 1945, still only half as many people would have been killed. Did no one think of this at the time?-- ELIZABETH MICHOUD; Stow, Mass.>Weighing the Moral ConsequencesThe decision to drop the bomb on Hiroshima at 8:15 in the morning, the time when the maximum number of people were outside commuting for schools and offices so that the maximum number of civilians could be killed, cannot be justified by any reasons whatsoever.-- TAKEO KONDO; Tokyo, Japan>Dropping the bomb on Hiroshima was an act of great moral callousness and evil. A military, rather than civilian, target could have been selected. If we wished, we could have contained Japanese aggression for another handful of months, shared the atomic bomb research with our allies, demonstrated the bomb's power on an uninhabited island or evacuated city, and brought the war to a close without sacrificing another 200,000 civilians.-- MATTHEW PENNIMAN; Lansing, Mich.>Two positive things came out of Hiroshima and Nagasaki: fewer casualties than Operation Downfall, and an exposure to this horror that ensured the Cold War never became hot. These bombings displayed the moral repugnancy of using nuclear weapons to civilians; without such approbation to keep its use in check, would the military ranks of one of the nuclear powers have broken to use these weapons of horror? The use of atomic weapons on Japan was militarily and morally justified, both in 1945 and 2015. Yet it was, and still remains, a deeply regrettable action of historical proportions.-- CHRISTOPHER HALL; West Barnstable, Mass.>Dropping the atomic bomb was a strategically effective decision for the United States to achieve victory in the Pacific. Yet the multitude of civilian casualties cannot be considered collateral damage because they were in fact the actual target of the attack. It was a large scale shock-and-awe strategy that was condemnable because these attacks were not only attacks against an enemy, but attacks against the very fabric of humanity.-- RENAN CABRERA; Doha, Qatar>An Invasion AvoidedIt's personal for me. My father was a weather forecaster. He would have been in the first wave of the invasion had it occurred. Someone has to provide precise information to the next waves to direct artillery. The projected casualties were over 30 percent. In all likelihood, I would not have been born.-- LINDA BLONSLEY; Arroyo Grande, Calif.>I am here, no doubt, because the bomb was dropped. My father was on a ship filled with young Americans steaming to Japan for a final invasion. It was predicted to be a brutal campaign. When the bombs were dropped and Japan surrendered, the news came to the ship and my father told me a cheer spread from one end to the other, as thousands of young American boys knew that the battle would not need to be fought.-- HAROLD GRODMAN; Charleston, W.Va.>My father's Army Engineer Corps unit was shipping its equipment to a forward staging area for the invasion of Japan. My brothers and sister and I would not be here if our dad was in that invasion. Thousands -- if not millions -- of other baby boomers would not have been born. The United States had to drop the bomb. Why suffer even more casualties? The bombs ended it.-- JAY BODENSTEIN; The Villages, Fla.>",0.0
"Jobless Claims Rise, but Less Than Expected:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"WASHINGTON -- (Reuters) The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week, suggesting labor market conditions are continuing to tighten.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 270,000 for the week ended Aug. 1, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It was the 22nd consecutive week that claims held below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strengthening labor market.""The unemployment claims are consistent with continued solid job creation and a reduction in labor market slack over time,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Economists had expected claims to rise to 273,000 last week. The data has no bearing on the employment report for July, which will be released on Friday by the Labor Department. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by 223,000, matching June's gain.Though job growth has slowed from last year's brisk pace, the unemployment rate, at 5.3 percent, is near the 5 to 5.2 percent range that most Federal Reserve officials consider consistent with full employment.Last week, the Fed upgraded its assessment of the jobs market, describing employment gains as ""solid."" The central bank, which is expected to raise interest rates this year for the first time in nearly a decade, also said labor market slack had diminished ""since early this year.""The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it smooths week-to-week volatility, fell 6,500, to 268,250, last week.A separate report from global outplacement consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed planned job cuts by American employers surged 136 percent to near a four-year high of 105,696 workers in July.The United States Army, which plans to eliminate about 57,000 troops and civilian employees over the next two years, accounted for more than half of the planned job cuts last month.Economists, however, expect minimal impact on the labor market from the layoffs, as military personnel are not included in the monthly payrolls count.""The impacts are expected to be almost negligible given the size of the announced job cuts relative to the overall labor force, as well as the fact that unemployment rates for veterans tend to not be that much different than unemployment rates for nonveterans,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.Employers in the technology sector, including Microsoft, Qualcomm and Intel, announced 18,891 job cuts in July.",0.0
ISIS Affiliate Issues Threat Over Hostage:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- Egyptian militants affiliated with the Islamic State extremist group have threatened to kill a hostage from Croatia within 48 hours unless the Egyptian government releases female prisoners, according to a video released Wednesday.It was the first time in a two-year-old campaign of violence against the government that the militants had kidnapped or threatened to kill a foreigner, raising new fears of more attacks.Many analysts had warned that the Sinai jihadists might take aim at foreign citizens or Egypt's Christian minority after they pledged their loyalty last fall to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and the video comes just two months after the militants' first attempts to attack the crucial tourism industry.In the video, a man who identifies himself as Tomislav Salopek, wearing a peach-colored jumpsuit and kneeling in the sand, addresses the camera. Speaking in English, he says that he is married with two children, works for a French company with a branch in Cairo and was abducted on July 22. A man wearing a camouflage uniform and mask stands behind him, holding a knife.Mr. Salopek, a 30-year-old citizen of Croatia, says that the militants want to ""substitute"" him with Muslim women in Egyptian prisons and adds that it needs to happen within 48 hours. ""If not, the soldiers of Wilayat al-Sina will kill me,"" he says, using the Arabic name of the militant group, which is also known as Sinai Province.The footage resembles videos released by Islamic State militants in Iraq, Syria and Libya, a sign of possibly closer coordination between the Egyptian jihadists and militants abroad.It presents a new challenge to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as he welcomes hundreds of foreign dignitaries for the inauguration of a new channel of the Suez Canal on Thursday, an event the government has promoted as a sign of Egypt's prosperous future.Insurgents who have been attacking the government since the military's ouster of President Mohamed Morsi in 2013 have carried out a series of brazen assaults in recent months that show a growing sophistication and a willingness to broaden their targets to include civilians. Since late June, militants have assassinated the country's top prosecutor, fired a missile at an Egyptian naval vessel and briefly occupied a town in the northern Sinai Peninsula.Militants also attempted attacks near the Pyramids of Giza and the Karnak Temple at Luxor, Egypt's most popular tourist destinations, in an ominous turn for the government, which depends heavily on the foreign currency generated by tourism.The kidnapping of Mr. Salopek also suggested that workers at foreign companies are under threat. The Croatian government announced his kidnapping last month, without naming him, saying that one of its citizens had been abducted by unidentified armed men in Cairo while driving to work in a company car, The Associated Press reported at the time.In the video, Mr. Salopek said he worked for CGG Ardiseis, a French company involved in the oil and gas industry.",0.0
Syrian Official's Visit to Oman May Signal a Diplomatic Opening:   [Foreign Desk ],,"Syria's government sent a high-level delegation on Thursday to Oman, the Persian Gulf state that historically has helped broker negotiations in regional conflicts.The delegation was led by Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, in his first visit to Oman since the Syrian war began more than four years ago.Arranged at the invitation of the Omanis, the visit raised new speculation that diplomatic energy is intensifying to seek a way to end the war.The official news agencies of Syria and Oman prominently reported the visit, in which Mr. Moallem conferred with his Omani counterpart, Yusuf bin Alawi. Specific details were not disclosed, but Sana, the Syrian agency, said both agreed that the ""time has come for unifying constructive efforts to put an end to the crisis in Syria.""The war has left a quarter of a million people dead, displaced half of Syria's population, created a vibrant incubator for Islamic extremism and sown instability in the Middle East.Mr. Moallem's visit came amid other signs of possible diplomatic shifts on Syria, along with indications that the government of President Bashar al-Assad was losing ground militarily.Last week, for example, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, announced that he had invited a range of Syrians to participate in separate discussions on how to restart peace talks.The United States and Turkey also began a joint military effort last week to strike Islamic State targets in Syria and provide safe zones along northern Syria's 500-mile border with Turkey.And the United States and Russia, in a rare instance of cooperation over Syria, agreed Wednesday on a United Nations Security Council resolution to identify and hold accountable the users of chlorine bombs in the war, widely believed to be forces loyal to Mr. Assad.Oman has often played a quiet role as a conciliator in the region. It helped in recent years to broker the release of French aid workers held by Qaeda extremists in Yemen and of three American hikers held in Iran.It was also the host of secret talks between the United States and Iran a few years ago that helped revive negotiations on the disputed Iranian nuclear program, which yielded an agreement last month.Oman is the only country in the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council that has not joined the Saudi-led military coalition bombing Yemen, and in recent months, it has sought to help find a solution to the conflict there as well.Mr. Assad, who is closely allied with Iran, has strained relations with many other countries in the region because of the war in Syria, which began in March 2011 as a political uprising against him and morphed into a civil conflict that has become a breeding ground for extremist groups, most notably the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, an affiliate of Al Qaeda.Last month, Mr. Assad conceded on national television that he faced a recruitment problem in the armed forces, which have ceded territory to the Islamic State, mainly in northern and eastern Syria.On Thursday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain with a contact network in Syria, said Islamic State fighters had seized Qaryatayn, a town in central Syria.If confirmed, it would be the group's first capture of a strategically important town in Syria since Islamic State fighters seized Palmyra, a storied ancient city, in May.",0.0
Central African Republic: Kidnapped Official Is Freed:   [Brief ],,"Militia fighters have released a government minister seized more than two weeks ago in the Central African Republic, officials and relatives said Wednesday. The government official, Armel Mingatoloum Sayo, who serves as minister of sports and youth, was abducted Jan. 25 from his car in the capital, Bangui. The circumstances of Mr. Sayo's release were not immediately clear on Wednesday. He was believed to have been taken by Christian militia fighters. The country exploded into sectarian violence in 2013 after Christian militia fighters tried to overthrow a government led by Muslim rebels. A transitional government put in place about a year ago is supposed to organize elections for later this year, but instability and violence threaten to derail that goal.",0.0
"Part Villain, Part Victim, Tarkanian Simply Won:   [Sports Desk ]",,"It was strange that Dean Smith and Jerry Tarkanian died within days of each other. They were coaching peers from opposite sides of the reputational spectrum, with Smith, the longtime coach at North Carolina, remembered as the gentlemanly throwback to a time when coaching was done right and Tarkanian cast as the misunderstood pioneer of an era -- the same era -- when it all went wrong.Smith's legacy was painted in sepia tones, tinged in Carolina blue. Among his noted achievements was a player graduation rate close to 97 percent.Tarkanian will be recalled far more colorfully, as someone who turned tradition inside out, bringing a fast-paced style and pro-style glamour previously unseen in college sports. Tarkanian acknowledged, a decade after taking over Nevada-Las-Vegas, that only six of his players had graduated. Yet his bronze likeness sits, chomping a towel, outside the university's on-campus arena.It can be hard to know what we want most from our college coaches. Tarkanian showed, as much as anyone, that the answers are, mostly, wins and entertainment.There was no one in college basketball like Tarkanian, who died in Las Vegas on Wednesday at age 84. He was reviled or revered, a saint or a sinner, depending on perspective and allegiance. But age and time have a way of softening the burrs of bad reputations. They turn rebels into forward thinkers.The N.C.A.A. helped turn Tarkanian into an anti-establishment hero. He was less a rebel than a symbol -- a mascot, really, with his own name (Tark the Shark) and a comical hangdog expression -- for the win-at-all-cost appetite of so many fans, their judgment clouded by an affinity to the colors of a particular university.Like most sports, college basketball can be a dirty game when examined too closely. Tarkanian understood that college basketball's one shining moment, as glorified at the end of the N.C.A.A. tournament each spring, is actually composed of a million murky moments along the way.Tarkanian took three programs to the N.C.A.A. tournament -- and all three on to N.C.A.A. probation. He won nearly 80 percent of his games, but more than 50 of them were later redacted from his record for various violations.He was harangued by the N.C.A.A. for decades, tarnished by everything from findings of academic fraud to a photo of players in a hot tub with a reputed gambler twice convicted of bribery.He apologized for nothing, and his droopy eyes, like those of a bloodhound, lent him a look of the eternal victim. Tarkanian countered every accusation with plausible deniability. His best alibi was that others were doing things just as bad, or worse, and he was probably right.He earned a $2.5 million out-of-court settlement with the N.C.A.A., which he said had spent decades harassing him with investigations. He used the N.C.A.A. as his foil, and as the N.C.A.A. became more bureaucratic and less popular, Tarkanian won the public-relations war. He came across as the lesser villain, if not the hero to the underclass.""I would talk every day to guys, and they would thank me sometimes,"" Tarkanian, speaking of fellow coaches, told The New York Times in 2013. ""I fought for things they wanted to fight for. Everyone knows the system is broken. But no one ever says anything about it because they don't want to be connected to me. They know what people will think.""Tarkanian prided himself on building winning teams with players that other programs did not want or would not risk. He was among the first to recruit heavily from junior colleges. He was chastised constantly for handing out second chances but never saw it as an insult.He defended his approach while criticizing those of some of college basketball's revered programs, such as Kentucky and U.C.L.A. Nothing frustrated Tarkanian more than when he was cast as the sinner to John Wooden's saint. He suggested that the two were more alike than anyone, especially the N.C.A.A., cared to know.Tarkanian's successful five-year stint at Long Beach State ended in 1973, shortly before N.C.A.A. investigators found recruiting violations. The N.C.A.A. practically set up a satellite office in Las Vegas when Tarkanian went to U.N.L.V., where its 1990 national championship was sandwiched by a stream of allegations of misdeeds and fights with the N.C.A.A.For the colleges that hired him, and the fans who adored him, the probability of violations was no match for the prestige of victories. Tarkanian's quick success at U.N.L.V. led to the building of the Thomas & Mack Center, where the front row, nicknamed Gucci Row, was filled with celebrities who cheered the fleet-footed teams that Tarkanian supplied. The Rebels still play in the arena, located off Tarkanian Way.Fresno State, Tarkanian's alma mater, wanted some of that, too, so it lured Tarkanian out of retirement in 1995. Victories piled up over seven seasons, although 49 of them were eventually vacated because of rules violations. There were investigations by the N.C.A.A. and an exposé on ""60 Minutes."" Among a string of incidents, there were accusations of point shaving and a series of player arrests, with one alleged assault involving a samurai sword.Tarkanian's legacy at Fresno State included a $100 million arena and a stretch under N.C.A.A. probation stemming from academic fraud. When Tarkanian returned to Fresno to be celebrated last March, his name was lifted to the rafters, and he was given a standing ovation.Tarkanian's family and supporters spent years campaigning to get him into the Basketball Hall of Fame, to join the likes of Dean Smith. But the call did not come until 2013, when his health was failing.In the end, the victories were too much too ignore. Tarkanian was no longer the rebel, if he ever was, but part of the establishment.Photograph Coach Jerry Tarkanian in 1990 with His U.N.L.V.

Admissions Quota Proposed in Brooklyn School Rezoning:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"Responding to concerns that a plan to redraw two Brooklyn school zones would fill an elementary school with affluent white children that currently serves mostly low-income minority children, Education Department staff members said on Monday that students receiving free or reduced-price lunches would be given admissions priority for half the seats in each class at the school.The department has said it wants to rezone the Dumbo and Vinegar Hill neighborhoods, where apartments sell for millions of dollars, so that children now zoned for Public School 8 in Brooklyn Heights, which is overcrowded and has a mostly white student body, would be zoned for Public School 307, which serves a public-housing project, educates mostly black and Hispanic children and has room to spare.The proposal to set aside half the school's seats came during a presentation of the rezoning plan to the community education council covering P.S. 307, the locally elected body responsible for voting on zone lines. Some parents at the school had asked the department for such set-asides to prevent the school population from becoming largely white.Whether preserving a portion of seats for students with lower incomes ultimately accomplishes those parents' goal would depend on how many students in the redrawn zone want to attend P.S. 307. Families living in the zone would have priority over students from outside the zone, even those who qualified for subsidized lunch.The Education Department said its current projections assume that the school would eventually have enough capacity for 30 percent of its students to come from outside the zone. The department also said that, though its plans call for the rezoning to take effect in 2016, it would not put the admissions plan in place until at least the following year, so as not to risk violating the terms of a federal grant.Faraji Hannah-Jones, co-president of the P.S. 307 parent-teacher association, expressed displeasure with the department's proposal. (Mr. Hannah-Jones's wife, Nikole Hannah-Jones, is a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine.)""When we said 50 percent, we didn't say 50 percent with conditions,"" he said. ""We said 50 percent, period.""He added: ""We don't want P.S. 307 to become P.S. 8.""The rezoning plan has drawn objections from current P.S. 307 parents, as well as parents who would fall into the expanded P.S. 307 zone. The Education Department originally planned to meet with the P.S. 307 council in September, but held off in order to hold a series of meetings with parents, teachers and neighborhood organizations. After hearing the department's presentation on Monday, the council has 45 days to vote on it. The council will vote only on the proposed new zone lines, not on the idea of setting aside half the school's seats for low-income families.The Education Department recently abandoned a similar rezoning proposal on the Upper West Side of Manhattan amid intense controversy. Under that proposal, several blocks were to be moved from a zone serving a highly regarded, mostly white school to one serving a mostly black and Hispanic school that was included this year on the state's list of persistently dangerous schools.Last week, in a small effort to reduce segregation, the department said it would allow seven schools to set aside seats for children from low-income or non-English speaking families.Follow The New York Times's Metro coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the New York Today newsletter.",0.0
Stores Told to Defend Supplement Assertions:   [National Desk ],,"The New York State attorney general's office issued subpoenas to four major retailers on Wednesday demanding that they provide evidence for a variety of health claims printed on the labels of the dietary supplements sold in their New York stores. The subpoenas were sent as part of an investigation into store-brand herbal supplements carried at Walgreens, Walmart, GNC and Target.The attorney general's office announced last week that it had conducted tests on 78 bottles of top-selling medicinal herbs at the four retailers and discovered that four out of five did not contain the ingredients advertised on their labels.The office said that the products appeared in many cases to contain powdered rice, wheat and ground-up houseplants.After a threat of legal action from the attorney general, the four retailers agreed to remove the products from New York shelves.A spokeswoman for New York's attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, declined to comment on the subpoenas. But a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation, who was not authorized to discuss the case, said the subpoenas demanded that the four retailers provide evidence of how they would prove the authenticity of their product claims.Ginkgo biloba supplements sold at Target, for example, carried a claim that the products supported ""concentration, memory and peripheral circulation, enhancing blood flow to the arms, legs and brain."" At GNC, a line of saw palmetto supplements promised to ""support healthy prostate function."" And Walmart's Spring Valley brand of echinacea supplements were promoted for ""healthy immune function.""Under a 1994 federal law, makers of supplements are allowed to make general health claims on their products, but they cannot imply that the products are able to prevent or treat disease. Companies are also required to identify all of the ingredients in a product on its label.A spokesman for Target said it had been in contact with the attorney general and would ""continue to cooperate.""GNC said it had provided test results demonstrating that its products were ""pure, safe and fully compliant."" A company spokeswoman added, ""The attorney general has refused to provide us access to his test results, and therefore we cannot comment on the allegations in this subpoena.""Walgreens, which removed the products nationwide, said in a statement, ""We take these issues very seriously,"" adding, ""We intend to continue cooperating.""Walmart said, ""Since the attorney general's office reached out on this issue, we have provided hundreds of pages in documents to answer the questions about the products.""",0.0
Trump's Take on de Blasio? 'The Worst Mayor in the U.S.':   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"Donald J. Trump tore into Mayor Bill de Blasio on Twitter on Friday, accusing New York City's top elected official of ""ineptitude"" and calling him ""the worst Mayor in the U.S., & probably the worst Mayor in the history of #NYC.""What took him so long?Mr. Trump -- the real estate mogul and Republican presidential candidate given to dismissing his critics as cowards, liars or worse -- has, it turns out, mostly held his tongue about Mr. de Blasio, a liberal Democrat and seemingly ripe target who resides two and a half miles from Trump Tower.The rebuke on Friday came after Mr. de Blasio, in a radio interview, called Mr. Trump a ""blowhard"" for supporting police surveillance of mosques.Mr. Trump, as he often does, responded with a post on Twitter that, three hours later, had been retweeted nearly 1,300 times: ""@BilldeBlasio should focus on running #NYC & all of the problems that he has caused with his ineptitude, & not be so focused on me!""Before that, there was little record of Mr. Trump, a connoisseur of the insult, directing his venom toward the mayor. In fact, in 2013, he predicted that Mr. de Blasio would ""end up being a good mayor, maybe a very good mayor.""This summer, when Mr. de Blasio criticized Mr. Trump's stance on immigration, and threatened to review the city's contracts with his affiliated companies, Mr. Trump responded rather formally, with a sternly worded letter to city officials. It was notably lacking in insults.Some in political circles speculated on Friday that Mr. Trump, as a force in the city's real estate industry, may have been reluctant to cross a man whose administration is his primary regulator.""He needs the Buildings Department, he needs the Fire Department, he needs various agencies to approve whatever project he has,"" George Arzt, a longtime political consultant, said. ""I wouldn't want to make fun of the mayor for that reason if I was a developer.""While Mr. Trump's name is a fixture of the skyline, his personal portfolio in New York is small. Privately, real estate executives said on Friday that he might have been motivated by a desire to protect the interests of his son-in-law, Jared C. Kushner, who is pursuing numerous projects around the city.Asked about Mr. Trump's remarks, a spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said only that they were in response to Mr. de Blasio's radio comments.The mayor, for his part, has gleefully criticized prominent Republicans in recent days. He singled out Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey for his views on Syrian refugees, saying the governor was acting ""un-American."" On Friday, referring to the terrorist group that staged the deadly attacks in Paris last week, Mr. de Blasio said that Mr. Trump was ""saying things that, bluntly, play right into ISIS' hands.""Roger J. Stone Jr., a Republican consultant and former adviser to Mr. Trump, said he was surprised by the developer's comments.""Can't imagine why Trump would attack de Blasio,"" Mr. Stone wrote in an email. ""De Blasio not well known (and therefore not yet hated) around the country.""Photograph Donald J. Trump in South Carolina On Friday, the Day He and Mayor Bill de Blasio Traded Barbs.

Syrian Town Where the Islamic State Was Repelled Now Strives to Rebuild:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KOBANI, Syria -- From the door of her modest breeze-block home, Faiza Mohammed recalled what her neighborhood once was and mourned what it had become.Her children's school has bullet holes in the walls and sandbags in the windows. The shops where she once bought groceries are mounds of rubble. The neighbors and relatives who used to live nearby and keep an eye on one another's children have left.Other than the elderly couple next door, she said, everyone is gone. Her house and theirs are the only two left on the street, islands in a sea of destruction.""We have people next door, so we are O.K.,"" said Ms. Mohammed, who was widowed before the Syrian civil war began. ""But at night we lock the door and don't open for anyone, because there is fear in the world.""A fierce battle by Kurdish fighters to repel an invasion by the Islamic State last year rocketed Kobani, an obscure border town in northern Syria, into the world's consciousness.But by the time the Kurds prevailed in January, backed by hundreds of American airstrikes in what was lauded as a model of international cooperation, the town looked as though an earthquake had struck it. Refugees who came back had trouble even locating their homes.Kobani, known in Arabic as Ain al-Arab, is trying now to overcome the deep scars of war and rebuild -- and there are signs of life.The challenges the town faces are huge, illustrating the huge toll of driving the Islamic State from urban areas, but also the costly burden of destruction that many Syrian cities will have to bear when the war ends.Around town, the crash of tractors tearing down damaged buildings resounds through the streets. Fleets of trucks haul off loads of rubble to dump outside the city in ever-expanding fields of waste.Shops selling cellphones, cigarettes and grilled chicken have reopened along a few commercial streets after installing new doors and glass. And thousands of displaced residents are returning each month, local officials say. Many have reclaimed their damaged homes, covering blown-out windows with plastic and plugging holes in walls with bricks to keep out the wind until real repairs can be made.""The city has become relatively suitable to live in again,"" said Idris Nassan, the head of foreign affairs for the area's new autonomous administration.When the battle ended, 80 percent of buildings were damaged and the infrastructure had collapsed, he said. The town had long before cut any links with the central government in Damascus, so local leaders formed the Kobani Reconstruction Board with members from the Kurdish diaspora to solicit aid and oversee rebuilding.Its first tasks were to restore water and sewage lines, reopen roads, dispose of unexploded ordnance and lay to rest the bodies of more than 100 people found in the rubble, Mr. Nassan said.Also destroyed were the city's new hospital, most government offices, a number of schools and bakeries, and two large wedding halls.Kobani sustained yet another blow in June, when Islamic State fighters dressed as anti-Assad rebels sneaked into town before dawn and went house to house, killing more than 250 people before Kurdish fighters killed them, according to Shervan Darwish, a military official here.But the administration has kept on, working with international organizations to open clinics and regulating generators so residents can buy a few hours of electricity per day.Its reconstruction efforts are restricted, however, by limited funds and the difficulty of obtaining building supplies.Although the town is near the Turkish border, Turkey has kept its crossings closed to most cargo -- a move widely seen as a strike against the area's Kurds.Many of Kobani's schools are damaged, but a number of them reopened last month, their courtyards filling twice a day with children doing exercises and heading to class. The early grades now use new Kurdish textbooks instead of the Syrian government's Arabic curriculum. It is unclear how regularly the teachers will be paid.""If there is a salary, of course no one would say no,"" said Shevin Mho, a teacher.The sprawling martyrs' graveyard outside town bears testament to the high human toll of the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. Hundreds of graves fill the site, the headstones of unidentified bodies bearing only numbers.On a rainy afternoon, a bereaved mother walked through the mud, screaming and yanking tufts of gray hair from her head while relatives tried to restrain her.Nearby, Badea Ali placed blue and red plastic flowers on the grave of her brother, Anwar, a Kurdish policeman who had been killed in a bomb attack. Ms. Ali said she had left Kobani for Iraq early in the war, then fled to Europe by boat last year and ended up in Germany.It had been painful to watch the battle for her hometown on the news in a strange country, but like many Kobani natives, the war had taught her to treasure the place, she said.""I started loving Kobani more than before because now we know its worth,"" she said.Her dream is to move back from Germany to open a hair salon, she said -- but not yet. ""The situation needs to settle down a bit,"" she said.The scale of the town's loss haunts many residents.Every morning, Muslim Mohammed, 56, returns to his damaged home and sits alone outside, drinking tea and thinking. The surrounding apartment buildings are all damaged and empty, now nesting grounds for birds.""I don't like to see a lot of people,"" said Mr. Mohammed, a mechanic. ""It is psychologically taxing.""He and his wife had fled to Turkey when the battle began, but three of his sons had joined the main Kurdish militia here.Ali, 17, was killed in battle, and Mohammed, 29, was shot dead during the Islamic State's incursion in June, Mr. Mohammed said. So he sent Ahmed, 15, to Europe by raft, hoping that distance might keep him alive.""Was I supposed to sacrifice all my sons?"" Mr. Mohammed said.Like many residents, he struggled to comprehend why the jihadists had poured so much into fighting for their town.""They didn't leave us anything,"" he said. ""Not our sons, our money, our homes.""Others, however, saw the victory as a large step toward empowerment for Syria's Kurdish minority after decades of governmental neglect. ""It was worth it,"" said Sherin Ismael, a 26-year-old seamstress. ""Now the world knows that there are Kurds.""Her family members, too, are the only residents left on their block, and her 2-year-old nephew, Osman, still cries at night, saying, ""ISIS is coming.""Some of their neighbors recently came to inspect their house and see what it would take to move back in.""Destruction comes quickly,"" Ms. Ismael said.

Arenas Hit Status Into the Cheap Seats:   [SpecialSections ],,"It wasn't long ago that fans at sporting events had only a handful of ticket options: Box seats, reserved seats and general admission seats, with perhaps a premium for the most desirable locations, like behind home plate or on the 50-yard line. Clubs and suites were often tucked into the ends of stadiums and the upper decks.But like airlines, hotels and other service providers, teams have increasingly sliced and diced their stadiums and arenas to generate more revenue by appealing to fans with ever more refined tastes and a craving for status. This trend has been driven in part by teams trying to extract as much money from fans for whom cost is no barrier, like the hedge fund managers and entertainers who pay thousands of dollars to sit, and be seen sitting, courtside at a basketball game.At the same time, teams are creating what they call ""premium experiences"" for fans in the least expensive corners of stadiums and arenas so they do not feel left out.""There is envy and class structure in every stadium,"" said Robert A. Boland, a professor of sports management at New York University. ""There are some consumers who want the access and proximity and will pay any price for it, so you want some areas that create exponential revenue. But you also want to create expectations and aspirations if you're a longtime fan and you can't afford what you're accustomed to.""Madison Square Garden, which last year completed a three-year, $1 billion renovation of ""the World's Most Famous Arena,"" provides a window into this phenomenon. Prices increased, but the number of new seating and club options exploded. Before the face-lift, the Knicks had 10 tiers of tickets priced from $30 to $3,000. Now, they have 29 price points between $49 and $3,700.Rangers fans can buy 27 levels of tickets, up from 14 before. The cheapest ticket fell $5 to $32, while the most expensive ticket rose $175, to $1,300.Before the renovation, suites were at the highest level of the arena. Now there are three levels of suites much closer to the action, a new lounge and club seats.Madison Square Garden is not shy about promoting its most expensive seats during every Knicks home game, when an announcer from the MSG Network interviews celebrities sitting courtside. But Howard Jacobs, the executive vice president for tickets, clubs and corporate hospitality, says that the vast majority of seats are far less expensive and that each area of the arena has novel features, like food courts, lounges and distinct views of the court or rink.""We saw the value in segmentation,"" Mr. Jacobs said. ""In many respects, it's a hospitality strategy. Just because you sit in the upper bowl doesn't mean it is not a premium experience.""Selling status can backfire if fans feel they have been priced out of the market. The New York Yankees were mocked in 2009 when their new stadium included tickets that cost $2,500 a game. Attendance has declined 8.5 percent since the new stadium opened. In 2010, as the Jets and Giants prepared to open their new stadium, the Jets slashed the price of their personal seat licenses, which entitle fans to buy season tickets, after blowback from longtime supporters. Fans who had waited years for Giants season tickets declined to buy them because they could not afford seat licenses that cost as much as $20,000.Teams are also segmenting their stadiums to confront another challenge: Drawing fans who can just as easily watch games at home on affordable high definition screens.Teams need fans in their seats and suites to generate income, but also to make the games look dramatic to viewers at home. They also know that attending a game is the best way for a fan to get hooked on a team.""Those kids that come out on game day, those are your future fans, and if you don't have that experience growing up, then the odds of you becoming emotionally attached is less,"" said Bill Johnson, senior vice president and design principal at HOK, a leading stadium designer. ""It's not about just making the revenue, but protecting the legacy of the game.""Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons, is wrestling with how to compete with television while convincing fans that attending games is affordable and unique. In the 71,000-seat stadium he plans to open in 2017, Mr. Blank wants to ensure that even the fans in the cheapest seats have an enticing enough experience so that they will leave their living rooms and come to the game.The stadium, which Mr. Johnson was involved in designing, will include a 360-degree five-story high-definition video board that will be visible to every fan; a 61,000-square-foot plaza for entertainment before and after the game; a 100-yard bar on the upper concourse with various food and beverage options; and a lounge with game-day content to appeal to fantasy football fans.At the same time, the stadium will include about 7,500 club seats and two ""ultraexclusive V.I.P. clubs,"" some with sideline access, parking and private entrances. While the number of premium seats is up, the total number of seats is down from 74,000 in the old stadium.""These stadiums are obviously getting more and more costly to build, but in my opinion you want to ensure that you have the same demographics within the stadium that you have in the greater community,"" Mr. Blank said. ""When you're watching something on television, you say to yourself that you were wish you were there and not on the couch.""Baseball teams face perhaps the biggest challenge getting fans because they have 10 times as many home games as football teams and many of them are played midweek and at night. So they are adding distinctive options to entice fans with different budgets. The Boston Red Sox, for instance, built a 35-person party suite adjacent to the Green Monster, the left field wall at Fenway Park, while the Washington Nationals have already sold out a new club with six private opera boxes.Teams in smaller, less affluent markets without the surfeit of big corporations and wealthy fans found in cities like Los Angeles and New York must promote affordable options. The Cleveland Indians built a two-story bar aimed at young professionals and expanded the children's clubhouse and family deck; both will open this season. The Arizona Diamondbacks sell about a third of their 67 suites on an annual basis for $130,000 to $170,000, not including food and beverages, less than half of what they would cost in New York. The rest are sold individually for up to $4,000 a game.Teams often maintain exclusivity by barring fans without a suite-level ticket from entering that level. But Derrick Hall, president of the Diamondbacks, took the opposite approach, allowing fans from other levels to walk through the suite deck to see what they could buy.""It piques their curiosity,"" Mr. Hall said. ""It's a dual strategy. Not everyone can afford it. But the trend has grown upward for fans to rent nightly instead of for a whole season.""The Diamondbacks do not market their most expensive tickets because wealthy fans will buy them anyway, he said, adding that it is better to market to fans to fill the rest of the stadium.""Even with our highest-priced seats, our renewal rate is near 100 percent,"" Mr. Hall said. ""Regardless of how we play, they're coming back.""Photograph Big Vision: Renderings of the Atlanta Falcons New Stadium, Clockwise From Top. An Aerial View.

East Timor: Opposition Figure Is Named Prime Minister:   [Brief ],,"East Timor's president has chosen an opposition party member, Rui Maria de Araújo, as the nation's new prime minister, his office announced Wednesday. Mr. Araújo, a former health minister, replaces Xanana Gusmão, who resigned last week ahead of an expected restructuring of the government. Party officials signaled that the cabinet was expected to be reduced to 34 members from 55 and would become more inclusive, with opposition figures among those appointed. East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was occupied by Indonesia in 1975. It voted in a referendum backed by the United Nations in 1999 to end the occupation, which left more than 170,000 dead, and it became a sovereign state in 2002. But the country has struggled to develop economically, and nearly half of its 1.2 million people live in poverty.",0.0
Link and Learn:   [Education Life Supplement ],,"College students increasingly view their time on campus as a hoop to jump through on their way to a job, yet many have no idea where they will land.While previous generations' career tracks were simple and mostly linear, now entire industries expand and contract at alarming speed. In this new world, government statistics move too slowly to capture employment dynamics. What jobs are available in a particular occupation? What type of experiences do I need to get a job in those professions? What did people who have those jobs study in college?As we live more of our lives online and use social media to update friends, family and colleagues on our job moves, much of what we need to know about the changing labor market is crowd sourced in real time. And many of those digital breadcrumbs end up in LinkedIn profiles.The online professional networking site knows where most of its members -- and there are more than 364 million of them worldwide -- went to college, what they studied, where they work and what they say their skills are.Over the last two years, this networking giant has been moving into the higher education industry, building an array of new tools for students in their search for a college and for a career. ""A lot of decisions in life are not based on perfect data,"" said Itamar Orgad, who leads LinkedIn's higher education product team at its sprawling headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. ""We are trying to optimize the data we have to better help the younger generation think about education and careers.""The interrelated search engines allow anyone to essentially reverse-engineer career paths of LinkedIn members by navigating the connections between their majors, schools and careers. While only as accurate as the profiles, the results are nonetheless addictive if you're interested in what people ended up doing with their English literature degree or where they worked before landing a great job at Google. Dive deep into profiles for details about members' lives, their skill sets, and how they are connected to other companies and people.Somewhat creepy? Perhaps. Useful to figuring out a career path? Maybe, although no two people are alike. Still, each click essentially draws a picture of the overlapping pathways that people do follow through their careers.The various search tools on linkedin.com/edu are part of LinkedIn's strategy to attract younger users, beginning in high school. In 2013, it lowered the required age of participants to 14 from 18; today, students are the network's fastest-growing segment of users.A handful of campuses have now partnered with LinkedIn to encourage students to use the site. Last spring at the University of California, Davis, representatives helped students build their profiles and a campus photographer took head shots for them to use online. Colleges themselves are using the service to find out where their alumni work.Of course, the promise of big data guiding career paths has its downside. Going to college has always been about exploration, an openness to serendipity that leads to majors and careers that students never considered before discovering a great class or landing an interesting internship. Following a trail suggested by data on other people's careers edits out the personal successes that come from carving out one's own way.AuthorAffiliation JEFFREY J. SELINGO Jeffrey J.

U.S. and Russia Back U.N. Vote on Chemical Attacks in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- The United States and Russia will support a United Nations Security Council resolution to identify the perpetrators of attacks using chlorine and other chemical agents in Syria, Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday.The agreement to back the resolution was reached Wednesday night in a one-on-one meeting here between Mr. Kerry and Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister.Diplomats at the United Nations said a vote on the resolution was scheduled for Friday.Although the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has the authority to determine whether chemical weapons have been used in Syria, the measure is intended to hold a specific organization or individuals to account.According to a draft of the resolution, a joint investigative panel of the O.P.C.W. and the United Nations would be established to identify ""individuals, entities, groups or governments who were perpetrators, organizers, sponsors or otherwise involved in the use of chemicals as weapons, including chlorine or any other toxic chemical"" in Syria.""What we are trying to do is get beyond the mere finding of the fact that it may have been used and actually find out who used it and designate accountability for its use,"" Mr. Kerry told reporters here.The United States and its allies have repeatedly charged that forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria have dropped chlorine-filled bombs from helicopters during the country's four-year civil war.The possession of chlorine is not banned by the international convention covering chemical weapons, although the use of chlorine as a weapon is banned. There are also concerns that Mr. Assad may not have given up all the chemical weapons he was required to hand over under a 2013 accord.Russia, however, has been a strong supporter of Mr. Assad, and differences between Washington and Moscow have held up the adoption of the measure.Mr. Kerry said the new resolution would establish a system for conducting investigations into whether chemical weapons were used, but he did not provide details.""What we will achieve, we believe, with this resolution is the creation of a mechanism which will actually enable us to do that,"" Mr. Kerry said.After Mr. Assad's forces were accused of using chemical weapons in the Damascus suburbs in August 2013, killing civilians and breaching President Obama's self-declared ""red line"" against the use of poison gas, the administration initially considered a military response.Mr. Obama shelved that threat after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia suggested that Mr. Assad might be persuaded to give up his stocks of poison gas.In September 2013, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov worked out a sweeping plan in Geneva to dismantle Syria's chemical arsenal, and the agreement was later endorsed by the Security Council.But Mr. Assad's apparent stocks of chlorine, critics say, have allowed him to maintain a rudimentary ability to use chemical agents.As Mr. Assad's position has weakened militarily in recent months, there have been increasing fears that he might make greater use of chlorine-filled bombs or even of weapons using other chemicals.Mr. Kerry said that he hoped a vote on the resolution would come soon. Referring to his meeting with Mr. Lavrov on Wednesday night, Mr. Kerry said that he and his Russian counterpart had ""talked about the U.N. resolution and indeed, I believe, reached an agreement that should try to see that resolution voted on shortly.""",0.0
"A Heavy Metal Affair, With Writerly Whispers and Bach, Too:   [Review ]",,"Complexions Contemporary Ballet, a company formed in 1994 by Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, has done what, for many midsize companies, remains impossible: It has lasted. But for a troupe named in honor of the multicultural makeup of its dancers, it remains distressingly bland. Where diversity also matters -- in its choreography -- is where this company falls short. No matter the mood or music, a sequence often repeats in Mr. Rhoden's pieces: After a running start, a dancer slides onto the stage, strikes an assertive pose and then -- as if trapped inside a force field -- shifts position by flicking a hip or tossing off a pirouette before retreating to the wings.This isn't dance for the stage, but for the camera; Mr. Rhoden choreographs in close-ups. On Tuesday, Complexions returned to the Joyce Theater with the first of three programs, including a premiere, to Metallica songs. With the exception of William Forsythe's ""Approximate Sonata,"" the dances are all by Mr. Rhoden, including ""Ballad Unto ...,"" set to Bach and originally choreographed for Tulsa Ballet. A work for 14 dancers who fade in and out of Michael Korsch's dewy lighting, this ballet, an exploration of facets of love, echoes Mr. Rhoden's narrow choreographic palette with several pas de deux. Interspersed between group sections, they draw on George Balanchine's neo-Classical aesthetic, but too often feel like parody.Still, there is the dancing of Ashley Mayeux, whose silken line and elegance sets her apart. In ""Cryin' to Cry Out,"" danced to Jimmy Scott, she performs a pas de deux with Andrew Brader, whose stellar partnering magnifies details, giving their pairing a sweetness and a naturalness. It was the one time Mr. Rhoden seemed to rise beyond his usual impulses and deliver something with a sense of humanity. In the solo ""Imprint/Maya,"" inspired by Maya Angelou, the dancer, again, is the key: Here, the veteran virtuoso Mr. Richardson remains crisp and spontaneous despite the forgettable material.The sad part about ""Strum,"" set to Metallica songs, is its tameness. Under red and yellow lights, again by Mr. Korsch, 15 dancers decked out in silver costumes by Christine Darch mimic the melodrama of the operatic rock music but never revel in it. Timothy Stickney, more manic than nimble, emerges as the main character -- dashing onto the stage, he whips his head with the fury, but it's all an act: He possesses little power of projection. What would Beavis and Butt-Head say? At least there was no air guitar.Complexions Contemporary Ballet performs through Nov. 29 at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, Manhattan; 212-242-0800; joyce­.org.Photograph Complexions Contemporary Ballet: Addison Ector, Center, and Members of This Company Performing ""Strum,"" a Premiere Choreographed by Dwight Rhoden and Set to Metallica Songs, at the Joyce Theater.

'The Statue of Liberty Must Be Crying':   Commentary,,"AS anti-refugee hysteria sweeps many of our political leaders, particularly Republicans, I wonder what they would have told a desperate refugee family fleeing the Middle East. You've heard of this family: a carpenter named Joseph, his wife, Mary, and their baby son, Jesus.According to the Gospel of Matthew, after Jesus' birth they fled to save Jesus from murderous King Herod (perhaps the 2,000-year-ago equivalent of Bashar al-Assad of Syria?). Fortunately Joseph, Mary and Jesus found de facto asylum in Egypt -- thank goodness House Republicans weren't in charge when Jesus was a refugee!The vote by the House of Representatives effectively to slam the door on Syrian refugees was the crassest kind of political grandstanding, scapegoating some of the world's most vulnerable people to score political points. As a woman named Maria Radford tweeted me after the vote, ""the Statue of Liberty must be crying with shame.""Yes, security is a legitimate concern. And, yes, we can't rule out the possibility that a terrorist will slip in with the refugees. Among refugees admitted to the U.S. since 9/11, there has been about one arrest for terrorism offenses for every 250,000 refugees, according to the Migration Policy Institute.Then again, by my back-of-the-envelope calculations there's maybe a 100-times greater likelihood that, say, a Floridian will turn out to be a murderer over a 10-year period than that a refugee will attempt terrorism. So if we're willing to allow Floridians free entry into other states, allowing Syrian refugees shouldn't be a problem.Let's be real: Refugee admission is the most deeply vetted pathway into the United States. Even for Iraqis who worked as translators for our military, risking their lives to keep Americans alive and enjoying strong support of American officers, vetting can take a couple of years.That's why the 9/11 attackers didn't enter the U.S. as refugees, but as students and tourists. If a terrorist group wants to attack America, it won't wait two years to try to infiltrate as refugees. It'll send people in as students or tourists, use fake or stolen U.S. or European passports, or just pay a human smuggler to take their terrorists across the border from Mexico or Canada.In any case, the Paris attackers identified so far were of French and Belgian nationality, not Syrian. One was carrying a Syrian passport, true, but it apparently wasn't his own and was perhaps meant to create an anti-Syrian backlash.The Islamic State's strategy is to create a wedge in the West between Muslims and non-Muslims. Whether that strategy succeeds depends on us: Will we clamp down with the harsh reaction the Islamic State sought?When we're fearful we make bad decisions. That was true around World War II, when we denied refuge to European Jews and interned Japanese-Americans. That was true after 9/11, when we invaded Iraq and engaged in torture.As George Takei, the Japanese-American actor who was interned for four years as a child, wrote in a Facebook post after the Paris attacks: ""There no doubt will be those who look upon immigrants and refugees as the enemy as a result of these attacks, because they look like those who perpetrated these attacks, just as peaceful Japanese-Americans were viewed as the enemy after Pearl Harbor. But we must resist the urge to categorize and dehumanize, for it is that very impulse that fueled the insanity and violence perpetrated this evening.""The demagoguery about refugees leaves me with an ache in the gut because, as I noted in my last column, I am the son of a refugee. Some 65 years ago, my Armenian/Polish/Romanian father was wandering Europe just as the Syrian refugees are today. Because Americans took a chance on him, I'm in a position to write this appeal for similar empathy today.Sure, some Syrians are terrorists, but some of the people I most admire in the world are Syrian doctors and ""White Helmets"" who help the victims of violence. House Republicans would block these heroes, would bar even the Yazidi and Christian victims of terrorists.Republican leaders say they simply want to tighten security to keep America safe. That's an echo of what American officials claimed in the late 1930s and early 1940s as they blocked the entry of Jewish refugees.Breckinridge Long, then a senior State Department official in charge of visas, warned that Nazi spies were trying to enter the U.S. as refugees. In the name of security, he established vetting rules so strict that few Jews could pass.""We can delay and effectively stop for a temporary period of indefinite length the number of immigrants,"" Long boasted in a 1940 memo. His callous security requirements led to the deaths of many tens of thousands of Jews.Yes, security was a legitimate concern then, as it is now, but security must be leavened with common sense and a bit of heart.To seek to help desperate refugees in a secure way is not naïveté. It's not sentimentality. It's humanity.AuthorAffiliation NICHOLAS KRISTOF I invite you to sign up for my free, twice-weekly newsletter.

Kings vs. Underdogs:   [Arts and Leisure Desk ],,"N.W.A., the group that brought gangster rap to the mainstream, angering conservatives and the F.B.I. along the way, burned hot and fast. The core group as it's remembered today -- Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, MC Ren, DJ Yella -- was together for only about two years, and in total the group lasted for maybe five, from the late 1980s to early '90s.But N.W.A. crammed several lifetimes into that short space, many -- but not all -- of which get airtime in the new biopic ""Straight Outta Compton,"" which opens on Aug. 14.Here we see the group members as fresh-faced Compton teenagers, as buddy collaborators and, eventually, as firebrands. What you don't see much of, though, is them as successful rap stars. Apart from a handful of scenes that show how quickly N.W.A. turned into an arena-worthy live act, and some flashes of the excess -- primarily wealth and women -- that came with their triumph, the group's most robust period is largely clouded here by other concerns.But the de-emphasis on the group's era of peak achievement is consistent with how Hollywood has long approached hip-hop. Like most of the hip-hop films before it, ""Compton"" does much better capturing the group -- and by extension, hip-hop -- as a product of struggle. Naturally, watching people overcome long odds thanks to their creative gifts has strong narrative impact. Everyone loves an underdog.But what about a king? When it comes to capturing hip-hop success -- the period that comes after the ascent -- Hollywood has been ambivalent at best. If hip-hop was still primarily an underdog story, this would be understandable, but the genre is at the center of pop culture, both commercially and aesthetically. It's minted several generations of stars. Film is maybe the last place it's infantilized.Excluding first-wave cash-in films like ""Beat Street"" and ""Krush Groove"" and also documentaries -- more on those later -- hip-hop films have fallen into roughly two categories. There are the biopics that purport to tell true stories, like ""Compton"" and ""Notorious,"" the 2009 retelling of the life of the Notorious B.I.G., who was killed in 1997; and the lightly fictionalized films in which actual artists' back stories are used as inspiration for original characters. Think of ""8 Mile,"" the 2002 film based on Eminem's early years, and ""Get Rich or Die Tryin',"" the 2005 film modeled after 50 Cent's origin story.All these films favor their subjects' years of initial struggle over their years in the spotlight. Take the romance associated with the written word, which runs through all of them. In ""Compton,"" a young Ice Cube obsesses over his rhyme notebook on the bus, while in ""8 Mile,"" Eminem's B. Rabbit does the same, scribbling on tattered sheets of paper at odd angles. Most of these films use lyric-writing as a means of overcoming a difficult situation -- in ""Get Rich"" it's childhood trauma, and also jail; in ""Notorious"" it's childhood teasing, and also jail.But N.W.A. was much more than that. It was among the first rap acts to focus lyrics strictly on violent, street life fantasy, and also the loudest in its protest of overzealous policing, including its 1988 single that spawned a vulgar catchphrase that persists to this day.But given the intensity of N.W.A.'s breakthrough, though, this narrow approach feels naïve. There's a clear tension between the two sections of ""Compton"": its heroic beginning, in which five unlikely stars climb their way to fame and infamy; and its protracted, staggering conclusion, packed thick with contract squabbles, Eazy-E's decline and death from AIDS-related complications in 1995 and maudlin reconciliations. The film skips uncomfortable chapters of the group's rise -- Dr. Dre's assault on the TV host Dee Barnes, accusation of racial insensitivity and homophobia in Ice Cube's ""Black Korea"" and ""No Vaseline"" -- in favor of the ones that make its members look like achieving underdogs, such as their public quarrel with the F.B.I. (""Notorious,"" by contrast, shows the Notorious B.I.G. being violent with two of the most important women in his life, Faith Evans and Lil Kim.)This is at least partly a reflection of who's doing the producing. You can feel the guiding hands of Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy-E's widow, Tomica Woods-Wright -- all executive producers -- each looking to boost post-N.W.A. reputations. ""Compton"" also capitulates to Hollywood's need for neat endings. Dr. Dre and Ice Cube are shown moving on to their next lucrative ventures: Dr. Dre departs Death Row in a principled fury and announces the name of his (troubled) new label, Aftermath; Ice Cube works on the script for ""Friday,"" the movie that would give him his first real foothold in Hollywood, now his home. Eazy-E's failing health and eventual death is used as a loud cautionary tale, and an opportunity for the formerly warring group members to find common ground.But ""Compton,"" a film about a spectacularly complex group, doesn't benefit from its Hollywood ending. It also doesn't help that this era has already been satirized in two films, ""CB4"" and ""Fear of a Black Hat"" -- richly, with both venom and love. That was also two decades ago, which means that for at least that long, the tropes of the era have been absorbed into the pop culture slipstream and no longer need to be sanitized.Still, for all its flaws, ""Compton"" is a rarity: a studio-produced hip-hop film, one with a budget of $29 million, according to The Hollywood Reporter. (That's $9 million more than ""Notorious,"" and roughly $11 to $12 million less than ""8 Mile"" or ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'."")In part, that's because the genre is young: Biopics typically focus on artists whose careers are complete, whether because of old age or death; plenty of hip-hop's first wave of megastars are still making music. There are also omnipresent issues around music rights. That means there are many great rap biopics yet to be made -- about Jay Z; Master P; Sean Combs; Lil Wayne and the Cash Money Records story; and Tupac Shakur (who's been given the documentary treatment).Any of those would demand a real reckoning with hip-hop success, though. Hip-hop has been an organic healing force, sure, but it's also a product and tool of capitalism. As recently as ""8 Mile,"" in 2002, a film about hip-hop could effectively skip mentioning its commercial potential. B. Rabbit, Eminem's character, isn't a rising star navigating the treacherous waters of new fame but a battle rapper in search of respect; he doesn't even quit his day job. In ""Get Rich,"" rap stardom is a goal but not achieved. 50 Cent is one of the most commercially successful rappers of the 2000s, but the film ends with his character, Marcus, removing his bulletproof vest onstage at a concert in his old stomping grounds, still lightyears away from fame.Unexpectedly, it's fallen to television to tackle hip-hop as an continuing, commercially successful art form. In 2003, there was the short-lived UPN series ""Platinum,"" and last year came ""Empire,"" the breakout primetime soap opera, which collapsed oodles of familiar rap narratives into one, rummaging through the genre's history at breakneck speed for inspiration. Television isn't above excavating the genre's innocent past, too. Baz Luhrmann is spearheading ""The Get Down"" for Netflix, about a crew of South Bronx teenagers at the birth of hip-hop, and VH1 recently filmed ""The Breaks,"" an original movie-cum-backdoor pilot -- inspired by ""The Big Payback,"" Dan Charnas's detail-packed hip-hop history book -- set in 1990, just at the dawn of hip-hop's commercial explosion.And sometimes, hip-hop success manifests itself in unexpected film choices. Only a group at the height of its powers could have survived ""Tougher Than Leather,"" the bizarre 1988 Run-DMC movie notable mainly for Rick Rubin's role as a bigoted criminal who giddily uses racial epithets. The film is also, in many ways, the seed of the Rapsploitation movement of low-budget, straight-to-VHS movies, a mode refined by Master P in the late 1990s with his No Limit Films. That shingle released clunky but engaging gangster flicks -- ""I'm Bout It,"" ""MP Da Last Don"" and more -- usually paired with album releases on No Limit Records. (Eventually, No Limit released films in movie theaters, but none as amusing or raw.) Rather than make films about hip-hop, Master P used his emerging celebrity and financial clout to remake himself as a multimedia mogul, a more interesting choice than those made by most rappers who would rather be immortalized in films than make them.By the late 2000s, digital documentation was becoming standard, so it shouldn't be a surprise that two of the most revealing and provocative hip-hop films have been recent documentaries. Michael Rapaport filmed A Tribe Called Quest on a 2008 tour, a decade after its final album, and captured a group in perennial distress. The resulting 2011 film, ""Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest,"" is both reverent and distressingly unvarnished, taking the group's importance largely as a given and letting the members' disagreements steer the narrative.That film captures a great hip-hop group well past its peak. Even more striking and revealing is ""The Carter,"" from 2009, directed by Adam Bhala Lough and capturing Lil Wayne at the height of his drug-addled productivity and popularity, releasing endless numbers of songs online for free and selling one million copies of his album ""Tha Carter III"" in its first week. In between recording his outrageously dexterous rhymes, Lil Wayne is a cipher; he watches ESPN, sips syrup and never sits for a formal interview. It's a little like watching Nero fiddle just before Rome begins to burn.In an age of perpetually running cameras, the possibility of an honest, robust, glamour-and-warts hip-hop film only increases. And in a way, one already exists: ""Tupac: Resurrection,"" the impressionistic 2003 posthumous documentary narrated almost wholly in Mr. Shakur's own words, much like ""Amy,"" the recent Amy Winehouse documentary. Mr. Shakur was one of the great hip-hop provocateurs, a charismatic musician and also a savvy actor. He was tender and tough. He was constantly renegotiating his public self, drawing people in and then pushing them away.And because of his popularity, he was forever on camera. This film was made in partnership with MTV and relied heavily on interviews, especially from the years when Mr. Shakur was beset with legal issues. A clear child of N.W.A. who also understands the art of persuasion, he speaks frankly -- about his upbringing, about his unlikely ascent, about the bad choices he made along the way, and about things that wouldn't fully reveal themselves to be bad choices until after his murder, in 1996. His candor and charm make for a film that understands hip-hop not just as a means of overcoming struggle, but also a place of easy thrills, a war zone that poses danger to its heroes, and a world without neat endings.Photograph The Fictional N.W.A.

Woman Killed in French Police Raid Had Unlikely Path to Extremism:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. LONDON -- When about 100 heavily armed police officers and soldiers took position shortly after 4 a.m. Wednesday outside the building in the Paris suburb of St.-Denis where the presumed ringleader of the Paris attacks was holed up, a young woman appeared in a window.""Help!"" she shouted, according to the reports of witnesses. ""Help me!""But Hasna Aitboulahcen, a cousin of Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the Islamic State jihadist believed to have orchestrated France's deadliest terrorist attacks to date, did not fool the officers, who suspected a trap. Two hours and 5,000 rounds of ammunition later, this 26-year-old daughter of a Moroccan immigrant was dead, in the end not by becoming the first woman to blow herself up in a suicide vest on Western soil, as first suggested by the authorities -- but by being killed in a fierce battle with the police.Ms. Aitboulahcen has been widely portrayed in the news media as a onetime wild child, at least by fundamentalist Muslim standards: smoking, drinking, staying out late, wearing cowboy hats, having lots of boyfriends and rarely going to the mosque. A widely circulated photograph shows her lying in a bubble bath, smiling coquettishly at the camera. In short, she seemed to be the thoroughly secular antithesis of how the pious Islamic State expects its women to behave.""She drank alcohol and went to nightclubs,"" said the son of one neighbor, who said he had not seen her in a while.But others, interviewed Friday in her old neighborhood, say that image was seriously out of date. Neighbors in the building where her mother lived and Ms. Aitboulahcen spent time intermittently, in the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, said the daughter had recently been wearing a face-covering veil outside the house. ""She was very respectful,"" said one woman, who recalled first seeing Ms. Aitboulahcen last summer. ""May God have mercy on her, whatever she did."" The woman declined to give her name for reasons of privacy.On a now-defunct social media account, Ms. Aitboulahcen apparently posted a photo of herself in full Muslim garb in June, French and Belgian news organizations reported, and wrote, ""Soon I will go to Syria, God willing.""She never made it there. But in the Wednesday morning raid in which Mr. Abaaoud and one other person also died and eight were captured, Ms. Aitboulahcen was said to have been the first one to open fire, with a Kalashnikov rifle. The authorities in Paris confirmed late on Friday night that forensic analysis had shown that it had not been Ms. Aitboulahcen who had donned a suicide belt in the face of the onslaught, but a third person, whose badly mangled body has not yet been identified.A tense exchange, captured on a neighbor's video around 5 a.m., preceded a battle of uninterrupted gunfire that would last for almost an hour.""Where is your boyfriend?"" an officer shouted.""He's not my boyfriend,"" Ms. Aitboulahcen shouted back.Seconds later the crack of an explosion rocked the building. Part of the third floor collapsed.A childhood friend who gave her name as Khemissa told a newspaper, Le Parisien, that she was shaken and saddened by the transformation of someone she had gone to school with and described as close.""She was not the kind of girl who blows herself up,"" said Khemissa, who declined to give her last name. ""She was a little crazy and loved life, made the most of life. She went through a bad patch and was influenced by these murderers.""Ms. Aitboulahcen's brother, who withheld his first name, said his sister radically changed over the past six months, though he questioned the sincerity of her religiosity. ""She was unstable,"" he told RTL radio. ""She fabricated her own bubble. In no way did she want to study her religion. I never saw her open a Quran."" Her mother said she had been ""brainwashed.""It is still not clear what role Ms. Aitboulahcen played in Mr. Abbaoud's Islamic State cell. Was she a part of a fourth suicide team, aimed at the moneyed towers of La Défense, the business district on the western edge of Paris, or Charles DeGaulle Airport, as the French police have hinted?Investigators are ruling nothing out. But it would have been a striking departure from Islamic State strategy and ideology so far if she were a commando.ISIS actively courts women as wives, mothers, recruiters and sometimes online cheerleaders of violence. Those who make it to Syria sometimes receive military training for defensive purposes. But they are barred from combat. Unlike other Islamist groups from Chechnya to Nigeria, including Al Qaeda in Iraq, the Islamic State has not used women as suicide bombers (the closest they got was a man dressed in women's garb).Instead, officials and terrorism experts say, Ms. Aitboulahcen was more likely to have been in charge of logistical support, organizing the safe house where she died and, by her mere presence, making the men look less suspicious.That Ms. Aitboulahcen was not a suicide bomber may prove irrelevant in the long run, experts say.""She is a martyr in their eyes,"" said Katherine Brown, a lecturer in the Defense Studies department of King's College London who specializes in female Muslim violence. The Islamic State is unlikely to pass up this opportunity to exploit her dramatic death, she said.It would not be the first time. Before a Jordanian pilot was filmed being burned alive in January this year, ISIS was demanding the release of a prisoner, Sajida al-Rishawi, an Iraqi woman whose suicide bomb failed to go off during a 2005 attack in Amman. The group called her a ""sister,"" said Sasha Havlicek, co-founder and chief executive of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a counterterrorism policy group that monitors female ISIS-affiliated social media accounts.And when Hayat Boumeddiene, the girlfriend of Amedy Coulibaly, an accomplice of the Charlie Hebdo attackers, managed to escape to Syria, the Islamic State's in-house magazine Dabiq praised her in a lengthy interview.Ms. Aitboulahcen was a fan. On Aug. 3, she posted a new profile picture on her Facebook page featuring Ms. Boumeddienne with a crossbow.In many ways, Ms. Aitboulahcen's life story mirrors that of the male members of her terrorist cell. She had a modest upbringing as the child of immigrants in a sometimes hostile society and fell into petty crime. The local police had a file on her for drug peddling.One of four children, she was born in the northern Paris suburb of Clichy-la-Garenne, a heavily immigrant neighborhood. Her upbringing appears to have been troubled. The parents split up early and all four siblings are believed to have spent some time in foster care. Her father moved to Creutzwald, the mayor of the town, Jean-Luc Wozniak, said, but Ms. Aitboulahcen appears to have lived mostly with her mother in the Paris suburbs.She was 16 when immigrant neighborhoods across the country erupted in a monthlong outburst of rioting in 2005.Neighbors told the mayor that she had spent the summer of 2011 in Creutzwald but had not been seen there recently. The father, who was born in Marrakesh and came to France in 1973 to work at a car factory, left for Morocco in July.It is unclear what triggered Ms. Aitboulahcen's radicalization. She was close in age to Mr. Abaaoud, a 28-year-old Belgian-Moroccan whose mother is the sister of Ms. Aitboulahcen's mother, officials confirmed.Investigators presume that Mr. Abaaoud, who is believed to have risen through the ranks of the Islamic State in part because he proved his aptitude in recruiting volunteer fighters in Europe, lured his cousin into the ISIS orbit, just as he had drawn in his younger brother Younes last year.If Ms. Aitboulahcen's role in the Paris attacks was to help keep the ringleader and a possible fourth attack team safe, it did not work out that way. In the end, it was her cellphone -- traced to the safe house -- along with a sighting of Mr. Abaaoud that helped lead investigators to the third-floor apartment in the suburb of St.-Denis, officials said.""She was the weak link,"" said one official close to the investigation.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"With Early Outburst, Rays End Mets', and Syndergaard's, Dominant Stretch:   [Sports Desk ]",,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Amid the clang of cowbells, Noah Syndergaard stalked off the mound, his face buried in his glove and hanging toward the ground.The Tampa Bay Rays had just pasted Syndergaard, an imposing 22-year-old pitcher for the Mets, for four runs in the first inning. He walked to the dugout soberly.Syndergaard, who in his previous nine starts was 4-1 with a 1.80 E.R.A., struggled uncharacteristically as the Mets fell, 5-4, to the Rays at Tropicana Field on Saturday. The loss broke the Mets' seven-game winning streak and cut their lead in the National League East to one and a half games.""Wasn't really sure what was going on in the first inning,"" Syndergaard said. ""It was kind of like a merry-go-round.""The Mets, who had been finding ways to win during their Florida trip, were afflicted not by the problem that had hurt them for much of the season -- no offense to aid their dominant pitching -- but by the opposite one, especially in the first inning.""Offense did their part,"" said Syndergaard, whose record on the road dropped to 0-5. ""I just wasn't able to uphold my end of the bargain.""On the second pitch of the game, Curtis Granderson hammered a fastball over the center-field wall for his sixth leadoff home run of the season. Daniel Murphy followed with a deep double, and Yoenis Cespedes with an opposite-field single. Lucas Duda then scored them both with a double to center field.Eight pitches in, the Mets' four batters had nearly combined for the cycle, and the team led, 3-0.In many games this season, three runs, let alone three first-inning runs, would have seemed like a luxury -- and would have provided ample offense for the Mets' starting pitcher. But in many games this season, the Mets' starting pitcher was not rocked for four runs in the first inning.Syndergaard's troubles started with the first batter, John Jaso, who pumped a ground-rule double to center field. Grady Sizemore then launched a two-run homer to right field, and the Rays had life. Syndergaard punched his glove and let out a deep breath.""Right down the middle,"" Mets Manager Terry Collins said of Syndergaard's pitch to Sizemore.After Syndergaard struck out Evan Longoria with a curveball, he gave up four singles and two runs. Mets reliever Sean Gilmartin started warming up.""I got a little too fastball happy,"" Syndergaard said. ""If I had mixed in a couple more off-speed pitches, that weak contact would have turned into outs, or swings and misses.""Finally, Curt Casali -- the ninth batter of the inning, who Collins said would have been Syndergaard's last of the game -- grounded a curveball to Syndergaard, who picked it up and tossed it to first base, mercifully ending the inning. Syndergaard had thrown 38 pitches and had given up six hits and the Mets' lead.""With them coming back with a four-spot, that's huge,"" Rays starter Nathan Karns said of his team's offense. ""It just puts me right back in the game.""Syndergaard said he had felt fine before the game and had not expected to struggle.""After warming up in the bullpen, I thought I was going to go nine scoreless,"" he said.Collins added: ""You saw the good fastball, but you didn't see the location. He just didn't have his command.""The four runs Syndergaard allowed in the first inning were the most he had given up in any full start since June 20 and deviated from his recent strong form: a dazzling Sunday night performance against the Washington Nationals that punctuated an emphatic sweep; eight shutout innings against the San Diego Padres, a game in which he carried a perfect game into the seventh; a 13-strikeout tour de force about a month ago.But perhaps the most damaging run came not in the first inning but in the fourth, when Longoria hit a sharp ground ball to shortstop Ruben Tejada with two outs and Jaso on third base. Tejada clutched the ball a few times before firing to first. Longoria beat the throw, and Jaso scored. That gave the Rays the lead again, and they held it for the rest of the game. Tejada said it was a play he should have made.""If Ruben doesn't double-clutch, he throws him out,"" Collins said. ""Just couldn't get the ball out of his glove. That happens.""Syndergaard, relieved after the fourth inning, allowed eight hits and five runs while striking out six. He threw 98 pitches.Before the game, Collins said he had noticed that Matt Harvey and Jacob deGrom had been affected by the emotional series against the Nationals last weekend, that it had taken a lot out of them during their starts on this trip. The intensity ""beats you down a little bit,"" Collins said, adding that it might happen to Syndergaard as well.But then he expressed hope.""I don't even know what's going to happen; this guy may pitch a no-hitter tonight,"" Collins said of Syndergaard. ""Who knows?""By the time Syndergaard walked off the mound at the end of the first inning, Collins knew.INSIDE PITCHCurtis Granderson, who had two home runs, hit a foul ball off his right ankle in the ninth inning. Granderson, hobbling in the clubhouse after the game, said it would not require X-rays. Terry Collins said Granderson would be evaluated on Sunday.Photograph Curtis Granderson Homered in the Top of the First, but the Rays Scored Four Runs in the Bottom.

The Uber-ization of Activism:   Commentary,,"The nasty battle between Uber and the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio over New York City's proposed cap on livery vehicles has ended, at least for now, with the city and the ride-hailing giant agreeing to postpone a decision pending a ""traffic study."" There's no doubt who won, though. The mayor underestimated his opponent and was forced to retreat.It wasn't just conventional pressure -- ads, money, lobbying -- that caught the mayor off guard. Uber mobilized its customers, leveraging the power of its app to prompt a populist social-media assault, all in support of a $50 billion corporation. The company added a ""de Blasio's Uber"" feature so that every time New Yorkers logged on to order a car, they were reminded of the mayor's threat (""NO CARS -- SEE WHY"") and were sent directly to a petition opposing the new rules. Users were also offered free Uber rides to a June 30 rally at City Hall. Eventually, the mayor and the City Council received 17,000 emails in opposition. Just as Uber has offloaded most costs of operating a taxi onto its drivers, the company uses its customers to do much of its political heavy lifting.Uber's earlier strategy to win entry into the Portland, Ore., market followed a similar pattern. When the city wasn't allowing the company to operate taxis, Uber exploited rules that allowed it to act as a delivery company, and distributed free ice cream around town. Using data on these deliveries, the firm shrewdly recruited recipients as pro-Uber citizen lobbyists, pressuring local officials to allow their cars to pick up passengers. It worked.Many tech firms now recognize the organizing power of their user networks, and are weaponizing their apps to achieve political ends. Lyft embedded tools on its site to mobilize users in support of less restrictive regulations. Airbnb provided funding for the ""Fair to Share"" campaign in the Bay Area, which lobbies to allow short-term housing rentals, and is currently hiring ""community organizers"" to amplify the voices of home-sharing supporters. Amazon's ""Readers United"" was an effort to gain customer backing during its acrimonious dispute with the publisher Hachette. Emails from eBay prodded users to fight online sales-tax legislation.So it's reasonable to ask whether there's still a bright line between being a business and being a campaign organization, or between consumer and activist. Tech companies' customers may think they are being served. But they are often the ones providing the service.To be sure, in the clash with Mr. de Blasio, Uber also deployed traditional public relations tools: TV ads, robocalls, mass mailings, celebrity endorsements and political operatives like David Plouffe, the former Obama strategist who now sits on Uber's board and serves as a ""strategic adviser."" Recent estimates indicate that even without counting its army of municipal strategists, Uber now retains over a third more state lobbyists than Walmart.But traditional methods will get you only so far in today's political-advocacy environment. Hence the new preference for what I call ""grass-roots for hire,"" where companies and interest groups galvanize their own users as unpaid campaigners, all with the tap of an app.These practices are redefining what it means to take part in politics. Social-media platforms were briefly perceived as democratizing tools, engendering transparency and empowerment in the digital age. But these new protest-on-demand movements blur the distinction between genuine citizen organizing and what often is called ""astroturf"": participation that looks grass roots but actually isn't, because it's been orchestrated to benefit a well-heeled patron.This Uberization of activism allows corporate sponsors to call the tune: Consider how for-profit colleges leaned on vulnerable students for political pressure, how Comcast enlisted its philanthropic beneficiaries to support the Time Warner merger or the way that the beverage industry hired protesters to oppose soda taxes.Technology may be neutral, but grass roots should mean bottom up, not top down. The #blacklivesmatter movement is a genuine grass-roots civil rights campaign, mobilized through social media. So is the environmentalist Bill McKibben's 350.org, with its blend of online organizing, social media strategy and in-person campaigning around climate change. But Uber's corporate populism is not. We should learn to recognize the difference.AuthorAffiliation EDWARD T. WALKER Edward T.

Cuomo Rejects U.S. Plan to Lend Money for Tunnels:   [Metropolitan Desk ],,"When it comes to paying for new train tunnels under the Hudson River, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wants the federal government to send, not lend, money to New York.Mr. Cuomo made that position clear in a letter he sent on Friday to the federal transportation secretary, Anthony Foxx. The governor said that the Transportation Department's offer to extend a loan to build the tunnels was ""not viable,"" and he urged Mr. Foxx ""to obtain actual funding from the administration or from Congress.""The response from Mr. Cuomo was his second since Mr. Foxx sent a letter on July 27 to Mr. Cuomo and New Jersey's governor, Chris Christie, inviting them to meet with him to devise a plan for a new rail crossing of the Hudson. Last week, the governors indicated that the project would require billions of dollars from the federal government.In a statement on Friday night, Suzanne Emmerling, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Department, acknowledged that it would be difficult to complete the project, but that the alternative would be much worse.""We're willing to go to extraordinary lengths to help move this project forward using existing federal resources,"" she said. ""If there are tools we need from Congress, we're willing to consider joining regional leadership to get them. But all of that is predicated on getting to yes on an approach, and we remain committed to doing so as long as the region is.""Nicole Sizemore, a spokeswoman for Mr. Christie said, ""The State of New Jersey and New York are committed to ensuring their taxpayers will not be forced to cover the cost of the project in the absence of significant federal funding.""The two passenger train tunnels between New York City and New Jersey are more than 100 years old, and their owner, Amtrak, has said that they need to be overhauled after being flooded by Hurricane Sandy. But shutting either of them for an extended period would cripple the region's transportation network and leave tens of thousands of commuters seeking alternative ways to get into and out of the city.Amtrak has proposed building two one-track tunnels to supplement the existing tubes. That project, known as Gateway, has been estimated to cost as much as $14 billion, Mr. Cuomo said. So far, Amtrak has committed about $300 million to get the project started, but none of the remaining funding has been arranged.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, and Mr. Christie, a Republican, have indicated that their states are willing to contribute to the project, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which the governors jointly control, has pledged to serve as an active partner in getting the tunnels built.Securing a large sum from the federal government may have been complicated by Mr. Christie's cancellation in 2010 of an earlier plan to build a train crossing. That project, which was known as ARC, had received commitments of $3 billion each from the federal government and the Port Authority. Mr. Christie later redirected the authority's money to other transportation projects in New Jersey.Mr. Christie said the ARC project placed an unfair share of the cost on New Jersey.Last month, Mr. Christie, who is running for president, said in a radio interview that if he were president, he would call together his transportation secretary and the governors of the two states and tell them that ""if we're all going to put in an equal share, then let's go build these tunnels under the Hudson River.""In an interview with NY1 on Friday, Mr. Cuomo said that there had been a number of meetings with federal officials.""The funding help turns out to be a loan,"" he said. ""We don't need a loan. Thank you, but no thank you.""",0.0
"My Little Pony and Transformers Toys Help Lift Hasbro Sales, and Its Profit Jumps:   [Business/Financial Desk ]",,"Strong sales of Transformers action figures, My Little Pony products and other licensed toys helped Hasbro's revenue rise 5 percent last year, despite negative currency fluctuations and broader industry woes.The company said on Monday that its adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter rose to $154.9 million, or $1.22 a share, up from $148.8 million, or $1.12 a share, in the same period last year. The company's shares closed up more than 7 percent on Monday, at $59.66.As children have increasingly favored digital toys and games, big toymakers have struggled to compete with smaller, nimble upstarts to create new products.International markets have become increasingly important to Hasbro, which has bolstered its foreign operations in recent years. Last year, overseas sales of $2.02 billion made up nearly half of Hasbro's total revenue and increased 8 percent from 2013. By comparison, revenue in the United States and Canada rose just 1 percent to $2.02 billion in 2014.But the strength of the United States dollar created unfavorable currency fluctuations for the company.While Hasbro's revenue grew 5 percent to $4.28 billion in 2014, it would have grown 7 percent if not for changes in foreign exchange rates.Net revenue increased 1 percent to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, but would also have risen 7 percent, excluding a $75.4 million negative impact from currency fluctuations.Adjusted net earnings rose 10 percent to $408.7 million, or $3.15 earnings a share, in 2014.Hasbro's results come after Mattel reported bleak financial results for the fourth quarter. Hasbro has done a good job of navigating some of the industry's problems, like a decline in demand for traditional toys, especially those for younger children, said Sean McGowan, an analyst with Needham & Company.""They've got a better portfolio of licensed brands,"" Mr. McGowan said.Mr. McGowan credited sales of Transformers action figures internationally, for example, for helping to increase revenue in emerging markets by 20 percent, to $689.8 million.On a call, Brian D. Goldner, Hasbro's president and chief executive, credited the strength of the company's Transformers and My Little Pony franchises, as well as a spike in boys' toys over all, with helping sales last year.Hasbro is also sitting on a potential windfall from some of its new licensing agreements, a major focus for the company.Hasbro won the rights to make toys based on some of Disney's princess characters beginning in 2016, and Mr. Goldner said that the company's entertainment and licensing segments posted their highest annual revenue ever last year.Hasbro will also introduce toys based on this year's latest installment of ""Star Wars,"" the toy industry's most anticipated film in a year crowded with big Hollywood movies.While Hasbro toys for films including ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" ""Jurassic World"" and ""Fantastic Four"" will hit shelves between four and eight weeks before the films' release, consumers will begin to see some ""Star Wars"" products beginning in September, and then more film-related products closer to the movie's December premiere, Mr. Goldner said.Some of Hasbro's growth was offset by a 4 percent decline in sales of preschool products, including Playskool and Sesame Street brands, last year.Sales also declined for Furby, a cuddly talking creature that Hasbro revamped in 2012.Shipping delays at some of California's ports required Hasbro to account for higher shipping costs, but Mr. Goldner said he did not expect the impact of the strikes to be significant in 2015.Photograph Two Men in Transformer Costumes in Beijing.

The Professor on Lee Child's Shoulder:   [Op-Ed ],,"THE tough-guy hero Jack Reacher first appeared 18 years ago in Lee Child's novel ""Killing Floor."" On Sept. 1, 2014, Mr. Child started writing ""Make Me,"" the 20th in his best-selling Reacher series. But for once he was not alone in his office in Manhattan. He was being observed by Andy Martin, a longtime Reacher fan and University of Cambridge lecturer, sitting a few feet behind him and shadowing the creative process all the way from the first word (""Moving"") to the last (""needle"").While Mr. Child was writing, Mr. Martin was simultaneously writing about him writing, typically for several hours a day.The bare-bones plot of ""Make Me"": A big guy called Keever is buried using a backhoe; Reacher gets off a train in the town of Mother's Rest; a mysterious woman is waiting for him (or is she?) at the station; the town is visited by death and destruction.In a recent conversation, the authors reflected on their cheek-by-jowl arrangement, beginning with a progress report on Mr. Child's current novel.>Lee Child Listen to this: ""In the morning they gave Reacher a medal, in the afternoon they sent him back to school."" The first sentence of ""Night School."" What do you think? I started writing it on September 1, as usual. And I turned around ... and you weren't there. Weird. I wanted to discuss the comma. The balance of the sentence. Should it be ""and""? I'll have to get back in the habit of talking to myself. Instead of you.>Andy Martin Hold on. Eleven syllables, each side of the caesura. Diminished alexandrine. Nicely symmetrical. And that rhythm. Like a limerick. Did you know you were doing that?>CHILD See, I'll miss all that.>MARTIN I know. It's like the end of a romance. There's one immigration guy convinced I was having an affair. Wanted to know why I kept coming back to New York. I said I wasn't working, it was just pleasure. How was it for you?>CHILD The earth didn't move. Except when the subway went by under the building. I'm used to having a housekeeper knocking around the apartment. It's similar. And you had a knack of getting out just before I started to feel physically oppressed. I mean, I understood why you wanted to do it, but sometimes I thought, why me?>MARTIN It could have been almost anyone. In theory. Maybe not Donna Tartt -- too slow! But you were willing. I liked your economy of style -- very degree zero. I'm still trying to work out why you let me do it, though. I used to think it was something to do with an aging boxer wanting a spectator for his last big fight. Or maybe a magician who finally decided to twitch aside the curtain and say, ""O.K., come back here and see how it's done."">CHILD Do you ever think there is something crazy about writing 20 books about the same guy?>MARTIN Well, no crazier than 19, I suppose.>CHILD That's why I did it. I thought it would make a change. I've been writing about Reacher for 20 years. I never had anyone watch me do it before. And it was a world first. A mad experiment. Literary criticism, but in real time. You were a wild card. What was the worst that could happen?>MARTIN I was sitting about two yards behind you while you tapped away. Trying to keep quiet. I could actually make out a few of the words. ""Nothingness"" I remember for some obscure reason. And ""waterbed."" And then I kept asking questions. I couldn't help myself. How? Why? What the...? Oh surely not! A lot of people thought I would destroy the book.>CHILD Here is the fundamental reality about the writing business. It's lonely. You spend all your time writing and then wondering whether what you just wrote is any good. You gave me instant feedback. If I write a nicely balanced four-word sentence with good rhythm and cadence, most critics will skip right over it. You not only notice it, you go and write a couple of chapters about it. I liked the chance to discuss stuff that most people never think about. It's weird and picayune, but obviously of burning interest to me.>MARTIN And the way you care about commas -- almost Flaubertian! I tried to be a kind of white-coated detached observer. But every observer impinges on the thing he is observing. Which would be you in this case. And I noticed that everything around you gets into your texts. You are an opportunistic writer. For example, one day the maid was bumping around in the kitchen and in the next line you used the word ""bucket."" Another time there was some construction work going on nearby and the next verb you used was ""nail."" We go to a bookstore and suddenly there is Reacher, in a bookstore.>CHILD You're right, that's my method. Like the thing with the bucket. In one ear, straight to the page.>MARTIN The funny thing is you are clearly a frustrated academic. For starters, you have officially seen ""Waiting for Godot"" 39 times. And you are good at the professorial analysis, be it of Shakespeare's ""stony limit"" (""Romeo and Juliet"") or your own lexis. Onomatopoeia and all that. At a certain point I started to feel de trop. All I had to do was quote you.>CHILD I believe it was Kant who said something like, Newton knew what he was doing and could take you back through the steps logically, whereas Homer had no idea and couldn't possibly explain it either. I sort of thought: Maybe I can explain it, I've been doing it long enough. Lots of readers ask me how I do this or that. I thought this was an opportunity to tell them. Or at least to figure it out for myself. Which was the main thing, to be honest. Normally I operate in a fog of instinct. I wondered if being required to explain as I went along might actually be more illuminating for me than you.>MARTIN That was the thing that drew me in: You never knew in advance what you were going to be writing about. It was a real tabula rasa. You really were making it up as you went along. I can certify that. I remember what you said when we started off down this road. ""I have no plot and no title."" No plan, no notes, no synopsis.>CHILD The beginning of a new book feels like stepping off a cliff into the abyss. A long free-fall. One of these days I'm going to end up flat on my face. Or not, as the case may be.>MARTIN Sublime confidence. And no rules.>CHILD Elmore Leonard had rules. Made to be broken. ""Never use an adverb."" Never is an adverb! If you want to start with, ""It was a dark and stormy night,"" go for it. I mean, suppose it really was a dark and stormy night? What are we supposed to do? Lie?>MARTIN Do you think you learned anything from watching me watch you for a year?>CHILD Well, I learned that line about Kant and Newton and Homer, that was one of yours, so thanks to Cambridge for that.

"Seeking Prize in East, Russia Floods a Ukrainian City With Troops",Invasions; Artillery; Military aid; Military reserves; Military personnel,"Enlarge this image.Russian forces are ratcheting up pressure on the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, pouring in waves of fighters to break Ukraine’s resistance and targeting supply lines in a bloody campaign aimed at securing Moscow’s first significant battlefield victory in months.Eleven months after Moscow launched its invasion, Bakhmut and the areas around it have become a center of intense fighting, with growing importance as both sides add forces to the battle. Russia intensified its effort to capture Bakhmut, which may be key to seizing the entire Donbas area, after months of bombardment beginning in the summer yielded few gains.“The situation is very tough,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a recent nightly address after meeting with military leaders. He said, “There are constant attempts to break through our defense.”Over the course of the war, firepower has proved critical to Russian gains, but the battle for Bakhmut has been different.Increasingly, Ukrainian fighters and analysts say, Moscow has been relying on a cruder tactic: trying to tip the city into its win column through the sheer weight of troop numbers. As a result, the Ukrainians say, Russian casualties in recent fighting in Bakhmut have been higher than in previous months.Part of Russia’s evolving strategy appears to be to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses with waves of soldiers, many drawn from President Vladimir Putin’s call-up of 300,000 men in September. That would be a departure from Moscow’s summer campaigns elsewhere in the Donbas, when artillery pounded cities for weeks before Russia launched a sustained ground offensive.In Bakhmut, Ukraine, too, has suffered heavy casualties. But the calculation for each side is not the same.Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Virginia, said the battle there has cost Russia more in human losses, because its fighters have often fought on foot, unsupported by armored vehicles. But while Ukraine’s losses may be fewer in number, he said on a recent episode of a military affairs podcast, War on the Rocks, they may be more painful.Many of the troops fighting for Russia around Bakhmut have been recruited from prison, and are less well trained than many of the soldiers Russia began the war with. Ukraine has mostly relied on national guard and other forces to hold its main defensive line in Bakhmut, with better-trained infantry units rushing in if those fighters are attacked or retreat.“Ukraine’s been forced to essentially trade higher-quality troops to hold Bakhmut against expendable Russian forces,” Kofman said on the podcast. That, he said, could “impede Ukrainian plans for an offensive down the line.”Bakhmut’s strategic value, military analysts say, is as a crossroads for some of the region’s highways. Capturing the city, which is in Donetsk province, would not guarantee that Moscow could make major advances in the east, but it would put Russian forces in better position to do so.Despite suffering setbacks elsewhere in eastern Ukraine and in the south, since last fall, Russian troops edging toward Bakhmut from the east have gradually squeezed the city. In January, they took the salt mining town of Soledar, 6 miles to the northeast.To the south, Ukrainian soldiers who recently left the front line said that a paved road that had been their main supply route into Bakhmut was now within range of Russian artillery and tanks, though still in Ukrainian hands. This leaves Ukraine relying on a road west to the town of Chasiv Yar, itself the target of frequent Russian attacks and harder to traverse.In past battles in the Donbas, Russian forces have often aimed to encircle a city first, leaving Ukraine to decide whether to expend costly resources to defend it. The pitched battle over Bakhmut suggests that Ukraine has overcome its qualms about engaging directly in a drawn-out fight for a city and is prepared to sustain losses in the hope that it can deplete its enemy’s strength still further.On Tuesday, fighting was also ranging elsewhere in Donetsk, in the town of Vuhledar.Moscow has moved from small-scale probing attacks around the town to a more concentrated assault, Britain’s Ministry of Defense said Tuesday, two days after Zelenskyy described Vuhledar as among the areas “under constant Russian attack.”The town, which had a prewar population of around 14,000, has been almost destroyed, but a Ukrainian military official emphasized on Tuesday that it was still under Ukrainian control.Military analysts say Ukrainian forces have been using their positions in and around Vuhledar to launch attacks on the region’s main railway hub in the occupied town of Volnovakha, less than 10 miles away, in a bid to weaken Russia’s resupply efforts. The head of Ukraine’s regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said Tuesday that there had been “intense fire” in the area.In the coming weeks and months, as both sides prepare for the offensives expected in the spring, Ukraine will be strengthened by new weaponry, including tanks and rocket systems supplied by the United States and other allies.On Tuesday, the French defense minister announced that his country would deliver 12 more Caesar howitzers to Ukraine and step up efforts to train Ukrainian soldiers, a significant increase in military aid from a country that had recently shown reluctance to part with more of its advanced artillery.And last week, the United States and Germany agreed, after a prolonged Ukrainian campaign, to provide battle tanks to Ukraine, among other military aid. Ukraine is also pressing its allies for jet fighters, although President Joe Biden has resisted sending Ukraine F-16s.But for now, the many new troops drafted in the fall are giving Moscow an advantage.

"Wagner Group May Have Committed War Crimes in Mali, U.N. Experts Say",Councils; Insurgency; War crimes; Atrocities; Rebellions; Minority & ethnic violence; Criminal investigations; Mercenaries; Murders & murder attempts; Human rights; Massacres,"Enlarge this image.DAKAR, Senegal — Mercenaries from the Wagner private military company may have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the West African nation of Mali along with the country’s military, United Nations experts said Tuesday, calling for an independent investigation into multiple instances of human rights abuses.“Since 2021, the experts have received persistent and alarming accounts of horrific executions, mass graves, acts of torture, rape and sexual violence, pillaging, arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances perpetrated by Malian armed forces and their allies” of the Wagner company, a group of independent experts, enlisted by the U.N. Human Rights Council to look into the group, said in a statement.Since the Kremlin-affiliated group began conducting operations with the Malian military, its mercenaries have been suspected of disproportionately targeting civilians, raising alarms among human rights groups and Western governments that have repeatedly denounced the group at the U.N. Security Council.African officials have also increasingly warned about the risk of destabilization and ethnic violence that the group could provoke.The United States named the Wagner military group as a significant transnational criminal organization in January, a move expected to discourage countries and institutions from doing business with the company.Wagner has drawn international attention in the past year as a vital adjunct to the Russian military, often more effective than the regular army, in the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has tried to cast himself and his mercenaries as an essential, brutal instrument of Russian military and foreign policy.In Africa, Wagner has been involved in at least a half-dozen countries, and in Mali Western officials estimate that around 1,000 Wagner operatives may be deployed alongside the country’s military, which has been fighting a jihadi insurgency that has swept the country’s north and center.But these tactics have come at a high price for local populations. Among other instances of human rights abuses, Wagner mercenaries and Malian soldiers have been accused of a massacre in the village of Moura, killing hundreds of people — including many unarmed captives and people who had no apparent ties to the insurgency — during a five-day siege last March.Those killings echo methods deployed in the Central African Republic, where the group also operates. “There’s a pattern of extreme violence carried out against civilians by Wagner working with the government, in Mali and in CAR,” said Sorcha MacLeod, chair of the United Nations Working Group on the use of mercenaries.The statement on Tuesday marks the first time that U.N. experts have publicly linked Wagner to atrocities committed in Mali, but in practice, their call for an investigation into the crimes is unlikely to yield significant results. Malian authorities have prevented U.N. investigators from accessing Moura or other sites of suspected human rights abuses.In their statement, the U.N. experts, who work for the Human Rights Council on a volunteer basis, warned that most of the victims of the crimes committed by the Malian military and Wagner operatives belonged to the Fulani minority.They argued that the ambiguity over the legal status of the Wagner group, as well as the reprisals against those daring to speak out, created a climate of terror for victims of the group’s abuses.“The first priority is to make sure that these types of atrocities stop,” said MacLeod, one of the statement’s authors. “The second priority is making sure that the victims and their families are given a voice and that they get access to justice.”The investigators stopped short of saying how many people suffered from human rights abuses in Mali, but Malian authorities received a more detailed set of allegations in January, which they have 60 days to respond to.These investigations are also unlikely to bring the Wagner group or any of its members before the International Criminal Court, for instance, since it has seldom dealt with mercenary organizations and prosecutes individuals rather than groups.Ornella Moderan, an associate researcher in the conflict unit of the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch research institute, said the experts’ statement would likely worsen an already deteriorated relationship between the government and the U.N. peacekeeping operation in the country, known as MINUSMA.“MINUSMA will pay the price for that kind of communications because they are the ones on the ground,” she said.Malian military officials and a representative for the Wagner company did not respond to requests for comment.Last week, Mali’s foreign minister, Abdoulaye Diop, said at the U.N. Security Council that his country would keep working with Russia, although he didn’t mention the Wagner group. He also rejected an offer by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres to reshuffle the peacekeeping mission.Several countries, including Britain, Egypt and Germany, announced last year that they would pull troops out of the mission, which will mean a loss of around 2,250 personnel — 17% of the current force.“Mali is one of the most difficult operating environments for peacekeeping,” Guterres said in an internal review of MINUSMA.

Ukraine and Russia Locked in 'Very Tough' Battle for Bakhmut,Invasions; Military reserves; Funerals; Humanitarianism; First aid; Cemeteries; Military personnel,"Enlarge this image.Russian forces are ratcheting up pressure on the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, pouring in waves of fighters to break Ukraine’s resistance and targeting its supply lines in a bloody campaign aimed at securing Moscow’s first significant battlefield victory in months.Eleven months after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion, Bakhmut and surrounding areas have become an epicenter of fighting, their importance growing as both sides have added forces to the battle. Russia and Ukraine are each believed to be preparing for larger offensives as warmer spring temperatures arrive, and as Kyiv’s Western allies try to rush armored vehicles and other heavy weapons to the front.Russia has intensified its effort to capture Bakhmut — which it sees as key to President Vladimir Putin’s objective of seizing the entire Donbas area in the east — after months of bombardment beginning in the summer yielded little progress. Civilians have streamed out of Bakhmut under Russian shelling, abandoning a city that before the war had a population of about 70,000, as the armies fought a series of battles in surrounding towns and villages that left heavy casualties on both sides.Despite suffering setbacks elsewhere in eastern Ukraine and in the south, since last fall, Moscow’s troops edging toward Bakhmut from the east have gradually squeezed the city. This month, Russian forces took the salt mining town of Soledar, six miles to the northeast. They have also cut off a road running north toward the town of Siversk.Bakhmut’s strategic value, military analysts say, is as a crossroads for some of the region’s highways. Capturing the city would not guarantee that Russia could make major advances in the east, but would put its forces in better position to do so.To the south, Ukrainian soldiers who recently left the front line said that a paved road that had been their main supply route into Bakhmut was now within range of Russian artillery and tanks, though still in Ukrainian hands. This leaves Ukraine relying on a road west to the town of Chasiv Yar, itself the target of frequent Russian attacks, and this road is harder to traverse.In past battles in Donbas, Russia has aimed to encircle a city first, leaving Ukraine to decide whether to expend costly resources to defend it. Military experts said that while the outcome of the battle for Bakhmut remained unclear, and while Ukraine could still manage to send in reinforcements to stabilize their defense of the city, a similar pattern appeared to be at play in the current fighting.Much of last year’s fighting around Bakhmut was spearheaded by Wagner, a Russian private military group that the United States last week designated as a transnational criminal organization and that U.N. officials accused on Tuesday of potential war crimes in Mali. Now, analysts say that regular Russian forces are increasingly prominent around Bakhmut and Vuhledar, a town about 60 miles southwest that has been virtually obliterated by shelling.“The situation is very tough,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine said in his nightly address Sunday after meeting with military leaders that focused on the fighting in Donetsk, one of two regions that make up Donbas.“Bakhmut, Vuhledar and other areas in the Donetsk region are under constant Russian attacks,” Zelenskyy said. “There are constant attempts to break through our defense.”Military analysts say that Ukrainian forces have been using their positions in and around Vuhledar to launch attacks on the region’s main railway hub in the occupied town of Volnovakha, less than 10 miles away, trying to weaken Russia’s resupply efforts. The Ukrainian head of the regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on the Telegram social media app Tuesday that there had been “intense fire” in Vuhledar and the surrounding area, without offering details.The fighting around Bakhmut has intensified in recent days, Ivan Tymochko, a serviceman and chairman of the country’s council of reservists, said on Ukrainian television.He said that Russian forces partly controlled the village of Sakko i Vantsetti, north of Bakhmut, and were attacking a sparkling wine factory on the eastern edge of the city and a meat processing plant, suggesting that they may be moving closer to the city. The battle lines are “constantly moving in one direction or another,” he said, adding that the situation around Vuhledar was under Kyiv’s control after heavy Russian losses.

"Mossad Conducted Drone Attack on Iran, Intelligence Officials Say:   [Foreign Desk ]",Drones; Missiles; Manufacturing; Research & development--R & D; Prime ministers; Intelligence services,"While the target's purpose is unclear, the city of Isfahan is a major center of Iranian missile production, research and development.TEL AVIV -- A drone attack on an Iranian military facility that resulted in a large explosion in the center of the city of Isfahan on Saturday was the work of the Mossad, Israel's premier intelligence agency, according to senior intelligence officials who were familiar with the dialogue between Israel and the United States about the incident.The facility's purpose was not clear, and neither was how much damage the strike caused. But Isfahan is a major center of missile production, research and development for Iran, including the assembly of many of its Shahab medium-range missiles, which can reach Israel and beyond.Weeks ago, American officials publicly identified Iran as the primary supplier of drones to Russia for use in the war in Ukraine, and they said they believed Russia was also trying to obtain Iranian missiles to use in the conflict. But U.S. officials said they believed this strike was prompted by Israel's concerns about its own security, not the potential for missile exports to Russia.The strike came just as Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken was beginning a visit to Israel, his first since Benjamin Netanyahu returned to office as prime minister. The director of the Central Intelligence Agency, William J. Burns, visited Israel last week, though it is not clear anything about the operation in Isfahan was discussed.American officials quickly sent out word on Sunday morning that the United States was not responsible for the attack. One official confirmed that it had been conducted by Israel but did not have details about the target. Sometimes Israel gives the United States advance warning of an attack or informs American officials as an operation is being launched. It is unclear what happened in this case.Isfahan is the site of four small nuclear research facilities, all supplied by China many years ago. But the facility that was struck on Saturday was in the middle of the city and did not appear to be nuclear-related.Iran made no effort to hide the fact that an attack had happened, but said it had done little damage. In statements, senior Iranian officials contended that the drones -- apparently quadcopters, a kind of aircraft with four separate propellers -- had all been shot down.Iran's official news agency, IRNA, reported on Sunday that the drones had targeted an ammunition manufacturing plant, and that they had been shot down by a surface-to-air defense system. It is not clear why Iran would build an ammunition production plant in the middle of a city of roughly two million people.Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, said at a news conference in Tehran on Sunday that ""a cowardly drone attack on a military site in central Iran will not impede Iran's progress on its peaceful nuclear program.""This is Israel's first known attack inside Iran since Mr. Netanyahu reassumed office, and it may indicate that he has adopted the strategy formed under his two predecessors and political rivals, Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid, who expanded Israeli attacks inside Iran.The quadcopters have become a signature of such operations.In August 2019, Israel sent an exploding quadcopter into the heart of a Hezbollah-dominated neighborhood in Beirut, Lebanon, to destroy what Israeli officials described as machinery vital to the production of precision missiles.In June 2021, quadcopters exploded at one of Iran's main manufacturing centers for centrifuges, which purify uranium at the country's two major uranium enrichment facilities, Fordow and Natanz. That attack was in Karaj, on the outskirts of Tehran. Iran claimed that there was no damage to the site, but satellite images showed evidence of significant damage.A year ago, six quadcopters exploded at Kermanshah, Iran's main manufacturing and storage plant for military drones.And in May 2022, a drone strike targeted a highly sensitive military site outside Tehran where Iran develops missile, nuclear and drone technology.The targets -- presumably including the military facility in Isfahan -- have been chosen in part to shake the Iranian leadership, because they demonstrate intelligence about the locations of key sites, even those hidden in the middle of cities.But the strikes also reflect a change in Israeli strategy made after Mr. Bennett became prime minister in June 2021. He lasted a year in the post.Mr. Bennett says in a forthcoming YouTube video shared with The New York Times that he decided to ""create a price tag"" and strike inside Iran in response to any attack on Israelis or Jews around the world. ""The Iranians beat us, and soldiers die on the border,"" Mr. Bennett says in the self-produced interview, while Iranian leaders ""sit quietly in Tehran and we do nothing to them.""It was not just the quadcopter attacks.After ""Iran tried to murder Israelis in Cyprus, in Turkey,"" Mr. Bennett says, the Revolutionary Guards Corps commander behind it ""was eliminated in Tehran."" He is referring to the assassination of Sayad Khodayee, who Israel claimed was a leader of a covert unit responsible for the abduction and killing of Israelis and other foreigners around the world.After Israel adopted the new strategy, Mr. Bennett says in the video, President Biden, during a meeting, made a ""sharp request"" that Israel inform the United States in advance ""of any action we take in Iran.""Mr. Bennett refused, he says.""There are things you do not want to know about in advance,"" he recalls telling the American president.The intelligence communities of Israel and the United States clashed on the issue in April 2021 after an operation by the Mossad to blow up bunkers at the Natanz enrichment site surprised the United States.Mr. Burns called his counterpart at the Mossad at the time, Yossi Cohen, to express concern over the snub. Mr. Cohen said that the belated notification was the result of operational constraints and uncertainty about when the Natanz operation would take place.Julian E. Barnes and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.Julian E. Barnes and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.Illustration This article appeared in print on page A10.",1.0
Battling Over Villages in East as Russia Strives to Encircle Bakhmut:   [Foreign Desk ],Invasions,"The area is a flash point in an offensive that Moscow views as crucial for its goal of seizing the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.Russian forces were wrestling for control of villages in eastern Ukraine near the city of Bakhmut over the weekend, the latest flash point in a battle that Moscow views as crucial for its push to seize the Donbas region in the east.Ukraine's general staff said on Sunday that its soldiers had repelled attacks on the small village of Blahodatne and several other settlements in the area. The statement came a day after Russia's Wagner group, a private military company that has conducted much of the fighting around Bakhmut on Moscow's behalf, claimed that its forces had captured Blahodatne, near a key supply line for Ukrainian forces.""Blahodatne is under our control,"" Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman and the head of the Wagner group, said on Saturday in a statement posted on a website for one of his companies. Russia's defense ministry has not confirmed the report and the claim could not be independently verified. Mr. Prigozhin has sought to cast his mercenaries as the most effective fighting force in the area and previously has claimed credit for battlefield advances ahead of Kremlin confirmation.Blahodatne lies between Soledar, a salt-mining town that Russian forces recently captured after weeks of intense fighting, and a road that runs north from the city of Bakhmut. The road serves as a crucial supply line for Ukrainian forces defending the city.Since the summer, Bakhmut has become a focal point of the fighting in eastern Ukraine and the target of Moscow's most significant attack. Moscow aims to encircle Bakhmut, cut off its supply routes and then force the city's defenders to withdraw. Despite some recent success, Russia's progress in the campaign has been grindingly slow and both sides have sustained heavy casualties.But since capturing Soledar earlier this month, Russian forces have stepped up shelling of the villages just to the west of it, including Blahodatne.Many civilians have followed a directive from the government in Kyiv to leave Donetsk, which is home to Bakhmut and one of the two areas that make up the Donbas region. Civilians who have stayed remain vulnerable to shelling and artillery attacks, with dozens killed in recent weeks. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of Donetsk's military administration, said on Sunday that five civilians had been killed a day earlier in the region.Almost a year after Russia launched invaded Ukraine, both sides are expected to launch renewed attacks in the coming months, as Kyiv puts to use the heavy weapons sent from allies and Russia deploys the huge numbers of men it drafted last year.Amid warnings that Russian forces were regrouping for an anticipated spring offensive, Ukraine's allies pledged new sophisticated weapons for the fight.Germany and the United States last week announced that they would send battle tanks to Ukraine, a move that came after weeks of tense back-channel negotiations between European and U.S. officials. But it may be months before the tanks rumble across the battlefield.Britain's defense ministry said on Sunday that the first Ukrainian soldiers had arrived in Britain for training on the Challenger 2 tanks that were promised earlier this month.In a speech on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine expressed gratitude for the latest promises of military aid, but said that his country's allies should still do more.""Ukraine needs long-range missiles, in particular, to remove this possibility of the occupiers to place their missile launchers somewhere far from the front line and destroy Ukrainian cities with them,"" he said in an overnight address.The city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, has faced repeated strikes in recent weeks. On Sunday, shelling there killed at least three people and wounded six others including a nurse, according to the regional military administration.""Today, the Russian army has been shelling Kherson atrociously all day,"" Mr. Zelensky said in his nightly address. ""Residential buildings, various social and transport facilities, including a hospital, post office, and bus station, have been damaged. Two women, nurses, were wounded in the hospital. As of now, there are reports of six wounded and three dead.""Russian forces have shelled Kherson on a near daily basis following their retreat from the city in November.The northeastern city of Kharkiv, recaptured by Ukraine in September, has regained much of its prewar population, but at just 25 miles from the Russian border remains well within striking distance. Late Sunday, the regional governor said a Russian missile strike on the city had killed at least one person and injured three.There have been signs that Russian forces are regrouping for a possible new offensive that could once again threaten Kharkiv. Ukrainian officials have said that а Russian tank division that had been deployed in Belarus had been diverted, possibly as part of a buildup of forces that could once again push into the Kharkiv region.But the Kremlin has set full control of the Donbas, where it has held considerable ground since 2014, as its immediate military objective. To that end it has mobilized tens of thousands of new recruits, though it has failed to achieve sweeping territorial gains in the region in recent months.Military authorities in Ukraine say that Moscow's advances in the Donbas region have come at the expense of heavy casualties, not least among the ranks of the Wagner private military company. Some analysts of the conflict say that Wagner's failure to secure Bakhmut, even after months of fighting, has dimmed its star in some Russian military circles.The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said in a report on Saturday that conventional Russian forces were ""likely replacing exhausted"" Wagner forces ""to maintain the offensive in Bakhmut"" after the capture of Soledar.But Russia might be less willing to sustain heavy losses among regular conscripts than among Wagner fighters, the report said. ""The Russians' ability to execute large-scale rapid offensives on multiple axes this winter and spring is thus very questionable,"" the report said.Photograph Viktor, a 62-year-old Ukrainian soldier, awaited transfer from a hospital where the wounded are brought from fighting in the Donbas region, which includes Bakhmut.

Russia and Ukraine Battle for Control of Villages Near Bakhmut,Invasions; Humanitarian aid; Humanitarianism; War; Violence; Military personnel,"Enlarge this image.Russian forces were wrestling for control of villages in eastern Ukraine near the beleaguered city of Bakhmut over the weekend, the latest flashpoint in a battle that Moscow views as crucial for its push to seize the whole of the eastern region of Donbas.Ukraine’s general staff said Sunday that its soldiers had repelled attacks on the small village of Blahodatne and several other settlements in the area. The statement came a day after Russia’s Wagner group, a private military company that has conducted much of the fighting around Bakhmut on Moscow’s behalf, claimed that its forces had captured Blahodatne.“Blahodatne is under our control,” Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessperson and the head of the Wagner group, said Saturday in a statement posted on a website for one of his companies.Russia’s defense ministry has not confirmed the report, and the claim could not be independently verified. Prigozhin has sought to cast his mercenaries as the most effective fighting force in the area and previously has claimed credit for battlefield advances ahead of Kremlin confirmation.Blahodatne lies between Soledar, a salt-mining town that Russian forces recently captured after weeks of intense fighting, and a road that runs north from the city of Bakhmut. The road serves as a crucial supply line for Ukrainian forces defending the city.Since the summer, Bakhmut has become a focal point of the fighting in eastern Ukraine and the target of Moscow’s most significant offensive.Moscow aims to encircle Bakhmut, cut off its supply routes and then force the city’s defenders to withdraw. Despite some recent success, Russia’s progress in the campaign, which began over the summer, has been grindingly slow, and both sides have sustained heavy casualties in intense fighting.But since capturing Soledar earlier this month, Russian forces have stepped up shelling of the villages just to the west of it, including Blahodatne.Many civilians have followed a directive from the government in Kyiv to leave Donetsk, which is home to Bakhmut and one of the two regions that make up the Donbas region. Civilians who have stayed remain vulnerable to shelling and artillery attacks, with dozens killed in recent weeks. Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of Donetsk’s military administration, said Sunday that five civilians had been killed a day earlier in the region.Almost a year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, both sides are expected to launch renewed offensives in the coming months, as Kyiv puts to use the heavy weapons sent from the West and Russia deploys the huge numbers of men it drafted last year.Amid warnings that Russian forces were regrouping for an anticipated spring offensive, Ukraine’s allies pledged new sophisticated weapons for the fight.Germany and the United States last week announced that they would send battle tanks to Ukraine, a move that came after weeks of tense back-channel negotiations between Western officials. But it may be months before the tanks rumble across the battlefield.Britain’s defense ministry said Sunday that the first Ukrainian soldiers had arrived in Britain for training on the Challenger 2 tanks that were promised earlier this month.In a speech Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine expressed gratitude for the latest promises of military aid but said that his country’s allies should still do more.“Ukraine needs long-range missiles, in particular, to remove this possibility of the occupiers to place their missile launchers somewhere far from the front line and destroy Ukrainian cities with them,” he said in an overnight address.The city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, has faced repeated strikes in recent weeks. On Sunday, shelling there killed at least three people and wounded six others, including a nurse, according to the regional military administration.“Residents of Kherson, go to the nearest shelter or stay at home,” it said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. “In no case stay outside.”Russian forces have shelled Kherson on a near-daily basis following their retreat from the city in November.But the Kremlin has set full control of the Donbas, where it has held considerable ground since 2014, as its immediate military objective. To that end it has mobilized tens of thousands of new recruits, although it has failed to achieve sweeping territorial gains in the region in recent months.Military authorities in Ukraine say that Moscow’s advances in the Donbas region have come at the expense of heavy casualties, not least among the ranks of the Wagner private military company.

"In Kharkiv, a Stillness That May Be Short-Lived:   [Foreign Desk ]",Invasions; War; Heat; Neighborhoods,"KHARKIV, Ukraine -- The trenchworks along the northern edge of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, have begun to erode and fill with refuse, and the soldiers who used them to defend the city from the Russian onslaught have now departed to other fronts. Today, the fortifications are manned only by mannequins in military uniforms, including one, perhaps too optimistically, wearing a blue United Nations peacekeeping helmet.All around, the blackened and pockmarked high-rise apartment buildings testify to the ferocity of the fighting that occurred here in Ukraine's northeast in the early months of the war. But there is a stillness now, and residents are not quite sure how to interpret it.Ukrainian forces expelled the Russian military from almost the whole region in a blitz offensive in September that took much of the world by surprise. Not only did it inject new vigor into the Ukrainian war effort, but it also gave Kharkiv some breathing space.But the Ukrainians could push their enemies only so far. The border is about 25 miles from the city center, well within range of many Russian weapons.Kateryna Vnukova, 19, an economics student in Kharkiv, said that from her 12th-floor apartment in the city center, she can sometimes see shelling off in the distance.""I think now it's all calm and quiet in Kharkiv, but it's not calm and quiet,"" said Ms. Vnukova, who was out for a twilight walk last weekend, but was trying to get home before sundown. ""Normally when it gets dark, the devils come out, the ones there, over the border.""Now there are signs that Russian forces are regrouping for a possible new offensive that could once again threaten the city. On Monday, Vadym Skibitsky, the deputy head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency, told a Ukrainian news outlet that а Russian tank division that had been deployed in Belarus had been diverted, possibly as part of a buildup of forces that could once again push into the Kharkiv region.As Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches its first anniversary, Kharkiv has become a showcase of Ukrainian military success, but also of its limitations. For the past four months, residents have slowly trickled back into the city; power, heat and gas have been restored to most dwellings; there is traffic in the streets and there are patrons in the restaurants and cafes, though many of their windows remain broken and boarded up.Kharkiv's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, boasted that the city population had doubled since the first months of the war to about 1.1 million people (from a prewar population of 1.4 million) and that construction was underway to repair some of the 4,500 homes severely damaged in Russia's failed effort to take the city. Though mindful that the fighting is far from over, the mayor is working with the acclaimed architect Norman Foster on a postwar development plan.""We have to return Kharkiv residents to the city, but they can't come back and find themselves in a broken shell,"" he said. ""The general plan for the development of London in 1943 was done under bombardment by the Fascists.""But his development plan does not envision a speedy end to the conflict, or a total respite for Kharkiv. Among its provisions is a requirement that all newly built apartment blocks include underground parking lots that can double as bomb shelters.While it is quieter in Kharkiv than it has ever been since the invasion began, to residents, the war does not seem all that far away. The air-raid sirens sound constantly, and Ukrainian fighter jets roar through the air on patrol. On a recent night, several burly men in camouflage uniforms and balaclavas entered an upscale Japanese restaurant to hand out draft notices to Ukrainian men, sending the waiters into hiding.Last weekend, a contingent of Ukrainian troops from the Kharkiv region was taking advantage of the relative quiet to hone their rifle skills and their combat maneuvers in a wooded training ground just outside of town.""We have some time, and we're not going to waste it,"" said their instructor, a 22-year-old lieutenant with the call sign Clover.Russian artillery and rockets pound outlying villages in the region, and heavier missiles regularly hit the city center as Russian forces continue to target critical infrastructure like power plants.An enormous thermal power plant has been attacked several times, including with an Iranian-made Shahed explosive drone. The attacks have blown a gigantic hole through the roof, broken all of the windows, and knocked out heating to the city for several days. Inside, workers keep equipment from freezing with large, gas-fed fire pits and plastic tarps to divide the huge boiler room into more easily warmed sections. The plant's main boiler remains mangled and out of commission, but workers have managed to keep the plant churning out heat with auxiliary boilers.No workers have been killed in the strikes.""Thankfully, God is protecting us,"" said Yevhen Kaurkin, the plant's technical director.The war is closer still in the northern neighborhood of Saltivka, which was ravaged by the fighting and remains a difficult place to live despite efforts to improve conditions. On a recent day, city workers in fluorescent green vests were raking leaves in front of a bombed-out building that looked like a wobbly tower of Jenga blocks.Because so many people have been killed while waiting at bus stops, the city has installed fortified concrete shelters designed to protect people from shelling. Each has a monitor inside showing a live feed of the street so that people can know when the bus arrives.During the worst of the fighting, hundreds of people sheltered in the musky basement of Kharkiv Municipal Gymnasium No. 172. Though no one now shelters there full time, hundreds still come back daily for warm meals prepared in the school's kitchen.The school's director, Oleksandra Utkina, who also teaches mathematics, said she was excited for the day when children could return, but acknowledged that would not happen anytime soon.""We need for them to stop shooting first,"" she said.Nearby, at a large army tent set up amid burned-out apartment blocks, a few locals were warming themselves and watching a soccer game on a large flat-screen television. Svitlana Kaminska, 62, was heating her dinner in a microwave. Though most residents of Saltivka left the neighborhood during the most intense fighting, Ms. Kaminska stayed, sheltering in her windowless corridor as rockets hit her apartment building again and again. In the entire building, she is the only one who remained.Just to get to her front door, she has to scramble over mounds of debris and avoid falling into a large hole in the sidewalk where a shell landed in August. Some of the apartments in her building have been gutted by fire, and none have windows. Successive blast waves have knocked in some of the interior walls and punched out the steel frames of the elevator doors.Ms. Kaminska's existence is grim. She has rigged up a small space heater and a lamp to a thin white extension cord plugged into the only working plug in the building, at the bottom of the stairs, and has managed to heat her home to a few degrees above freezing. Only the audio on her television is working.But these discomforts do not bother her much, she said.""For me, the most frightening thing is not the cold or the fact that I'm alone here, but heaven forbid the possibility of another attack,"" she said. ""Doesn't anyone have influence over this Russia, to quiet them down a little?""Natalia Yermak contributed reporting.Natalia Yermak contributed reporting.Photograph A resident towing water to his home in the battered neighborhood of Saltivka in Kharkiv, Ukraine, where it's still difficult to live despite efforts to improve conditions.; Top, an abandoned Russian tank in the forest of Ruski Tyshky, a village north of Kharkiv.

Fight Over Supply Routes May Signal an Offensive:   [Foreign Desk ],Invasions; Assaults; Military strategy,"While the heaviest fighting is still around the city of Bakhmut, in recent days Russian forces have stepped up assaults on a strategic town farther to the south.KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian troops mounted a fierce assault on Ukrainian forces on Saturday in an effort to dislodge them from critical positions in eastern Ukraine, with Moscow seeking to protect vital supply routes and both armies jockeying for position in anticipation of new offensive campaigns.Russia has been trying for months to break through well-fortified Ukrainian defensive positions across the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, throwing wave after wave of soldiers into the fight and suffering heavy casualties but making few territorial gains.Those efforts have taken on greater urgency as Western and Ukrainian officials warn that Moscow plans to launch a large-scale assault aimed at regaining the upper hand, nearly a year after Russia invaded Ukraine. Military experts and Western officials say they also believe that Ukraine will try to mount an offensive of its own to drive Russia out of occupied areas in the east.""It is no secret that they are preparing for a new wave by Feb. 24,"" Oleksiy Danilov, the head of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told Radio Liberty on Friday, referring to Russian forces and what will be the first anniversary of their full-scale invasion. Moscow's immediate goal, he said, is to capture the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions and then ""to completely go beyond the borders of the regions.""President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia this month abruptly replaced the top commander of Russia's war effort with Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, who American officials believe secured the top job by vowing to go on the attack, with an initial goal of gaining ground quickly in the east.The epicenter of the fighting in eastern Ukraine since the summer has mainly been around the city of Bakhmut, which has taken on a symbolic significance that military analysts say outweighs its strategic importance.But in recent days Russian forces have stepped up their assaults on the town of Vuhledar, just over 90 miles south of Bakhmut. It sits at the intersection of the eastern front in the Donetsk region and the southern front in the Zaporizhzhia region, a location that makes it well positioned for resupplying Russian forces moving between the two fronts.Military analysts say that Ukrainian forces have been using their positions in and around Vuhledar to launch attacks on the region's main railway hub in the occupied town of Volnovakha, less than 10 miles away, threatening Russia's resupply efforts. Trains are essential for moving heavy equipment and large troop formations across the battlefield, so the more Ukrainian forces can cut off the lines running from Russia to southern Ukraine, the more they can isolate Russia's forces in the region.In that light, pushing the Ukrainians back from Vuhledar would help Russia secure the train lines. It ""guarantees Russia a stable supply of the southern part of the occupied territories,"" according to an analysis issued on Saturday by the Conflict Intelligence Team, an independent group that analyzes open-source intelligence.Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-appointed leader of the Donetsk region, said that an eventual capture of Vuhledar by Russian forces ""solves many problems,"" and predicted that the town ""may become a new, very important success for us,"" according to Russian news reports on Friday.Ukrainian officials have rejected recent reports from Kremlin proxy officials and Russian military bloggers of advances in the area. Col. Sergei Cherevaty, the spokesman for Ukraine's eastern military command, reported fierce fighting around Vuhledar but said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces had thwarted the Russian attacks.Neither the Russian nor the Ukrainian claims could be independently verified. Britain's Defense Intelligence Agency said on Friday that Russian military sources were probably ""deliberately spreading misinformation in an effort to imply that the Russian operation is sustaining momentum.""In his overnight address to the nation on Friday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called the intensity of the fighting around Bakhmut and Vuhledar ""extremely acute"" and destructive.""The occupiers are not just storming our positions -- they are deliberately and methodically destroying these towns and villages around them,"" he said.The intense fighting has led to numerous casualties on both sides as the Ukrainian and Russian militaries pound away at one another with artillery and missiles. At a military hospital near Bakhmut on Saturday, there were at least eight bodies of Ukrainian soldiers in the morgue, and the sound of incoming and outgoing artillery shells was incessant.On Saturday evening, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that Ukrainian forces had used an American-made multiple rocket launcher known as HIMARS to strike a hospital in the Russian-controlled Ukrainian region of Luhansk, killing at least 14 people.But Ukrainian officials said the building, located near the town of Novoaidar, was actually a division headquarters of the Russian military. The building was equipped with an antenna and special communications equipment, which is not typically found at a hospital, said a senior Ukrainian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.The official said the Ukrainian forces spent several days trying to determine whether the building was in fact a headquarters and whether they would be in violation of international law in case of an attack. The decision to fire was made only after precise confirmation, including photos and videos of the communications equipment installed there, the official said.The devastating toll on civilians from those attacks was evident on Saturday morning in the village of Kostyantynivka, roughly 15 miles southwest of Bakhmut, where a Russian missile strike killed three people and wounded 14 others.In the courtyard of a residential neighborhood, the body of a man lay sprawled on the ground amid wreckage and debris. His mother knelt over him, sobbing and stroking his side. Another corpse was covered by a sheet, splayed out near a wheelbarrow that the man had likely been pushing at the moment of impact.A woman, smoking on a balcony above the courtyard, cried and shouted out to no one in particular: ""I hate you all.""Marc Santora reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Michael Schwirtz from Kostyantynivka.Marc Santora reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Michael Schwirtz from Kostyantynivka.Photograph Ukrainian security forces collected fragments on Saturday after a deadly strike on a residential building in Kostyantynivka, in eastern Ukraine.

Annexed Area Will Soon Use Moscow Time:   [Foreign Desk ],Time zones; Alliances,"Russia, which has many time zones, is seeking to integrate the regions after illegally annexing them in September.Russia will switch four occupied areas of Ukraine to Moscow's time zone, it said Friday, a shift that carries symbolic meaning far heavier than its practical effect as it highlights the Kremlin's attempt to solidify control of the illegally annexed regions.Russia's Ministry of Industry and Trade said in a statement that the four regions -- Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia -- would switch to Moscow time ""in the near future"" as part of a process of ""gradual synchronization of Russia's legislature."" The regions are one hour behind Moscow now.But Moscow has long had a particular focus on time zones, cherishing its own 11 divisions as a source of national pride. There is no rational justification for its having that many, experts say, and their multiplicity can lead to absurdities, particularly in its far east. When it is noon in Vladivostok, for example, it is 11 a.m. in Tokyo, even though it lies farther east.So it was perhaps predictable that the Kremlin would seek to manipulate time zones in Ukraine as part of its ""Russification"" campaigns over the course of the war. These have involved forcing teachers to use a Russian curriculum, replacing local officials with occupation appointees, substituting the Ukrainian currency with the ruble and issuing Russian passports.Moscow illegally annexed the regions of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia in September, despite international condemnation and even as parts of the areas remained under Ukrainian control. Since then, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has been urging his government officials to speed up the process of integrating the regions into Russia's economic, legal and social infrastructure.""Russia needs to gain a solid foothold there,"" he said in December at a meeting with young Russian scientists. ""It means working on those territories and with those people so that the people feel the benefit of the accession to Russia.""However, it promises to take far more than shifting to Moscow time for Russia to establish that perch in Ukraine, as the front lines continue to shift and few Russian officials, teachers or other municipal workers are willing to risk their lives by working there. Russia has had to resort to offering higher salaries for teachers in the regions, and several officials there have been targeted in attacks by pro-Ukrainian fighters.On Thursday, Mikhail Mishustin, Russia's prime minister, said that the four regions would be part of the Russian social insurance system, which issues payments to workers when they fall ill or become disabled. And on the same day, Russia's Parliament approved a bill on integrating schools and universities in the regions into the Russian education system.It remains to be seen what contribution the time switch will make in the effort to win over Ukrainian hearts and minds, when even Russians themselves are resistant to such changes. In 2009, Dmitri A. Medvedev, then Russia's president, suggested eliminating some of Russia's time zones as part of a broader modernization effort for Russia. His proposal went nowhere.Illustration This article appeared in print on page A9.",1.0
Strikes Kill 12 in Ukraine as Russia Again Tries to Pull Plug on Electricity:   [Foreign Desk ],Missiles; Cities; Armed forces,"Russia's forces once again pounded energy infrastructure and other civilian sites, a day after the United States and Germany pledged to send dozens of tanks to Ukraine.KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia fired dozens of missiles at Ukrainian cities on Thursday, piercing snow clouds and air defenses to kill at least 12 people across the country, in the Kremlin's campaign to punish civilians while its army fights in Ukraine's east.The wave of strikes came a day after Germany and the United States pledged to send dozens of battle tanks to Ukraine, a significant step up in Western military support. Ukraine managed to shoot down 47 of the 55 missiles, according to its Air Force command, including 20 in the area around the capital, Kyiv.But a variety of Russian strikes still killed 11 people across 11 regions, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. Another 11 people were wounded, and 35 buildings were damaged, it said.A 12th civilian was killed later in the day when a Russian rocket hit a village council building in Kochubeivka, a tiny community in the Kherson region, a military official said on Telegram.As it has for months, Russia appeared to target Ukraine's energy grid in subfreezing winter weather. ""The main goal is energy facilities providing Ukrainians with light and heat,"" Ukraine's prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in a post on Telegram.Since October, Russia has launched more than a dozen major waves of missiles and drones on Ukraine's energy facilities, as well as many smaller attacks, in a campaign to impair the power supply and leave civilians without power, heat and light over winter.The barrages have sometimes come after Ukrainian successes, like its fall campaigns in the northeast and the south, but have continued as the pace of fighting has slowed to a grueling battle of attrition in the east and south.The missile strikes have often landed in residential areas, as well, sometimes to devastating effect, as when more than 40 people were killed in a strike on an apartment building in Dnipro, in central Ukraine.Large booms shook Kyiv about 10 a.m. local time on Thursday, sending residents fleeing into subway shelters and basements. The mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said one person had been killed and two wounded when a projectile hit a building in the city's south.At least one blast could be heard on camera, interrupting an interview that a member of Ukraine's Parliament was giving to the broadcaster Sky News. ""Where was it?"" a woman asks in the video, as the lawmaker and journalist stand amid destroyed Russian tanks. ""Not far away.""Three people were killed in a Russian strike on infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia, the state prosecutor general's office said on Telegram. There were also reports of missile strikes in the Vinnytsia region in western Ukraine and outside the port city of Odesa, causing ""massive power outages"" there, according to Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba.France's foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, was in Odesa on Thursday to meet with Mr. Kuleba -- diplomatic talks that were literally forced underground by the Russian strikes.""Thanks to a Russian missile, I experienced my 1st diplomatic bilateral meeting in a shelter,"" Ms. Colonna tweeted on Thursday, sharing a photo of the ministers at a table in a bare room. ""Coffee was warm, merci!""Mr. Kuleba, who noted that Odesa's historic center was designated a world heritage site in danger this week by UNESCO, said on Twitter that the meeting was ""probably the first time in history when Foreign Ministers hold talks in the basement of an Opera House.""The U.N. agency's designation gives the city, which was conquered in the late 18th century by the Russian Empire and given the name Odesa by the empress Catherine the Great, ""access to reinforced technical and financial international assistance,"" UNESCO said. ""Ukraine may request this to ensure the protection of the property and, if necessary, assist in reconstruction if attacked.""Ms. Colonna said that the ministers had discussed French support for Ukraine, saying, ""Our assistance will continue in all areas and for as long as necessary.""Mr. Kuleba -- who joked that the French minister was ""the Catherine I'm pleased to see in Odesa"" -- has pressed Ukraine's supporters in Europe and the United States to significantly increase their military aid. Not long after Germany and the United States announced they would send dozens of battle tanks to Ukraine, he called for ""Western-type fighter jets.""Ukrainian officials have argued that such warplanes would help them defend against Russia's missile volleys.For the past week, Russia's Air Force has been conducting exercises north of Ukraine in Belarus, keeping Ukraine on heightened alert. Countrywide air attack sirens have sounded each time Russian planes take to the air.Overnight, according to Ukraine's Air Force Command, Ukraine's air defenses shot down 24 Iranian-made Shahed exploding drones.Both the United States and Germany have pledged Patriot air-defense missile batteries to Ukraine, and the U.S. military is training Ukrainian troops in Oklahoma on how to use the weapon, which is the most advanced American ground-based air-defense system.The Biden administration has significantly increased its military aid to Ukraine over the past year, gradually expanding the array of arms it has agreed to provide to include HIMARS rocket artillery systems last summer, Stryker armored fighting vehicles, Patriot missiles and, now, M1 Abrams tanks. Britain has promised to send some of its Challenger 2 tanks, while Germany has agreed to supply some of its Leopard 2 tanks and to allow other countries to give theirs to Ukraine.Military experts and Western officials say they believe that Ukraine and Russia will both attempt offensives in the spring, as Kyiv puts to use the heavy weapons sent from the West and Russia deploys the huge numbers of men it drafted last year.""The spring and summer look like they're going to be fairly decisive,"" said Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va. Speaking on the podcast ""War on the Rocks"" this week, Mr. Kofman said that in its next offensive, Ukraine would have ""a strong opportunity to show that it can continue retaking territory.""But unlike its past offensives in the Kharkiv region to the northeast and the Kherson region to the south, ""the next offensive comes with risk,"" he said. ""If it's not successful, Ukraine faces the real danger of a counteroffensive.""Michael Schwirtz reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Alan Yuhas from New York.Michael Schwirtz reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Alan Yuhas from New York.Photograph Waiting to receive aid in Oleksandrivka, a village in the Kherson region.

U.S. Copter Raid Kills an ISIS Leader in Somalia:   [Foreign Desk ],Leadership; Military withdrawals; Counterterrorism,"Officials said the man helped facilitate a network of ISIS affiliates around the world.WASHINGTON -- U.S. Special Operations commandos killed a senior Islamic State leader in an early-morning helicopter raid in a remote area of northern Somalia on Thursday, U.S. officials said.The Pentagon identified the leader as Bilal al-Sudani. American officials said he was operating in Somalia but that his influence as one of the terrorist group's top financial operatives extended across Africa, into Europe and even to the ISIS branch in Afghanistan that carried out the August 2021 bombing at Kabul's international airport that killed 13 American service members.In a statement on Thursday, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said Mr. al-Sudani ""was responsible for fostering the growing presence of ISIS in Africa and for funding the group's operations worldwide, including in Afghanistan.""Biden administration officials said no civilians were injured or killed in the raid. They also said none of the American troops involved were hurt, although one was bitten by a dog they had brought with them.During a call with reporters Thursday afternoon, a senior administration official described Mr. al-Sudani as ""a key operative and facilitator for ISIS' global network."" The official said the operative was killed along with 10 other Sudanese Islamic State associates.The raid took place in a remote mountainous cave complex in the Puntland region of northern Somalia, months after American spy networks detected Mr. al-Sudani's hidden headquarters and monitored the location to study his movements.The senior administration official said that the Special Operations troops had been prepared to capture Mr. al-Sudani but that the response from his associates when American troops arrived at their cave complex ""resulted in his death.""Nonetheless, based on previous raids, the commandos almost certainly scooped up laptop computers and hard drives, cellphones and other information from Mr. al-Sudani's hide-out that could provide tips for future counterterrorism operations.The fact that the Pentagon sent commandos to kill or capture Mr. al-Sudani -- a decision that required President Biden's approval this week -- rather than using a less risky drone operation indicated his significance.One senior administration official said there was no one else in the Islamic State's global constellation of operatives who rivaled Mr. al-Sudani in his ability to receive and distribute illicit funds -- as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars at any given time -- to far-flung ISIS affiliates on at least three continents through a network of clandestine contacts he built over more than a decade.In another sign of Mr. al-Sudani's importance, the military built a mock-up of his mountainous cave complex to allow commandos to rehearse their secret mission -- just as Navy SEAL Team 6 forces did before the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 in Pakistan.American officials did not reveal which Special Operations unit carried out Thursday's raid, but SEAL Team 6 has historically conducted the most sensitive counterterrorism missions in Somalia.Mr. Biden redeployed about 450 U.S. troops to Somalia last year, reversing former President Donald J. Trump's abrupt withdrawal in January 2021. But those forces only provide training to Somali forces and do not conduct counterterrorism operations, Pentagon officials said.Somalia is better known as a harbor for Al Shabab, the terrorist group linked to Al Qaeda, than for the Islamic State. Indeed, before Mr. al-Sudani joined the Islamic State, he was designated a terrorist by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2012 for helping foreign fighters travel to a Shabab training camp and for facilitating financing for foreign insurgents in Somalia.The raid represents the latest in a string of setbacks this year for the Islamic State and its core leadership in Iraq and Syria, the most serious since the end of the jihadists' so-called caliphate nearly four years ago.In late November, the Islamic State announced that its overall leader, whose identity has remained shrouded in mystery, had been killed in battle in Syria less than nine months after taking charge of the terrorist organization.Outside the Middle East, the group has experienced mixed success. Its branch in Afghanistan is locked in a stalemate with the Taliban government. But ISIS fighters have struck highly symbolic targets in Afghanistan, including Russian and Chinese interests.Islamic State fighters, along with Qaeda cells, are gaining strength in West Africa, with the violence now threatening countries like Ghana, Togo and Benin.At its peak, the Islamic State ruled a self-proclaimed caliphate the size of Britain that spanned the border between Syria and Iraq and boasted tens of thousands of fighters from around the globe. Its extremist vision of eternal combat between its forces and anyone who opposed them inspired deadly attacks in Paris, Brussels, Istanbul, Berlin, Baghdad and other major cities.But an international coalition led by the United States worked with local forces in Iraq and Syria to fight it, finally pushing it from its last patch of territory in eastern Syria in March 2019.Illustration This article appeared in print on page A7.",1.0
Death Toll of Russian Strike on City Far From the Front Lines Rises to 40:   [Foreign Desk ],Cities; Civilians; Apartment buildings; War; Military air strikes; Casualties,"The authorities said 34 people remained missing after three days of searching for the living and the dead at an apartment building struck by a Russian missile in Dnipro.Climbing over shards of concrete and metal, scraps of cloth and pulverized furniture, emergency workers found one body after another on Monday, lifting them out of the cratered wreckage that had once been bedrooms and kitchens in one of Ukraine's largest cities.The crews reported a new toll on Monday, days after the desperate search began: at least 40 people killed by a Russian strike over the weekend, one of the single deadliest for civilians since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly a year ago.Dnipro, the city where the ordinary, nine-story apartment building had stood, is far from the front lines where Ukrainian and Russian troops have been fighting viciously over abandoned villages and even mere yards of land. But the strike on Saturday fit a pattern of Russia firing long-range missiles at civilian targets, including residential neighborhoods and electrical plants -- what military analysts say is a Russian strategy, in the wake of battlefield setbacks, to terrify civilians and pressure the Ukrainian government into talks.""After this horror that I saw, I cannot imagine they wanted anything else,"" said Viktoria Tamich, 33, an event organizer whose apartment, across the street from the strike site, is now a chaotic jumble of debris and broken glass.At a coffee shop when the air raid siren sounded on Saturday, she narrowly avoided being home during the strike. When she did return, she said, she saw a ""terrible scene"" of smoking rubble and bloodstains in the stairways of her own building.""I could hear people screaming under the ruins,"" she said.The United Nations said on Monday that it had confirmed the deaths of more than 7,000 Ukrainian civilians since last February, including 398 children. But the numbers include only deaths it has been able to corroborate, and U.N. monitors acknowledged that the full civilian toll is much higher.Russia's recent strikes have hit cities far from the most intense fighting, which is currently in eastern Ukraine. Russian shelling on Monday hit a boarding school, a residential building and a vacant children's hospital in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, the regional governor said, part of a days-long bombardment of the area that heavily damaged a Red Cross facility and left at least three people dead.The attacks on civilian areas come as Ukraine and Russia are locked in battles around the eastern city of Bakhmut and the nearby town of Soledar. Ukrainian officials say that their forces are still hanging onto parts of Soledar, notwithstanding claims by Russia's military and a private military company, Wagner, that they have taken the town.Military analysts say that Ukraine, Russia and Wagner have all suffered heavy losses in eastern Ukraine, describing the fighting as a contest of attrition, with Russia relying on troops drafted in the fall, Wagner on men recruited from prisons, and Ukraine on the continued support from the West.Some Ukrainian officials have raised concerns about Russian military exercises that began on Monday in Belarus, which the Kremlin used as a staging ground to attack last year. Faced with the activity in Belarus, the deep toll of the missile strikes and a long war ahead, the government in Kyiv has urged its backers in the United States and Europe to redouble their military aid, securing promises of British tanks and French, German and American armored vehicles.The United States has also started training 500 Ukrainian soldiers, a U.S. military official said on Monday, on how to coordinate units in battle using artillery, armor and ground forces. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited the U.S. base in Grafenwoehr, Germany, on Monday to view the training, which began on Sunday.To help Ukraine defend against the long-range missile strikes that have been battering civilians, like those in Dnipro, the U.S. military is working with its forces on the operation of the Patriot, an advanced air defense system. The Ukrainian troops have arrived at Fort Sill, Okla., for the training, the U.S. military announced on Monday. Both Germany and the United States have pledged the system to Ukraine.The strike on Dnipro added dozens more casualties to the staggering civilian toll in Ukraine. In addition to the 40 dead, at least 75 people were wounded in the strike and 34 remained unaccounted for as of Monday afternoon, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said in a post on Telegram.As night fell, rescue crews continued searching for the missing people, living or dead.

They included two young mothers, Olha Usova and Iryna Solomatenko. One victim, Maria Lebid, was 15 years old, a Ukrainian official said.“She was school president and ballroom dancer,” the official, Emine Dzheppar, the first deputy foreign minister, wrote on Twitter. “Her beautiful life dance was cut short.”Residents’ apartments were shorn open, exposing scenes of ordinary life disrupted violently.

Dnipro Mourns As Dozens Die In Russia Strike:   [Foreign Desk ],Missiles; Displaced persons; Military air strikes; Evacuations & rescues; Cities; War; Casualties,"Rescue workers were still digging through the ruins of a residential building in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Sunday, a day after a Russian missile attack.More than 24 hours after a heavy-duty missile built to sink ships exploded in a dense Ukrainian cityscape of homes and shops, the lights of emergency workers played across the rubble on Sunday, in search of life.Death was easy to find.As smoke and dust rose into the Dnipro sky, a light dusting of snow began to accumulate on five victims who had been pulled from the rubble and laid out in body bags in a small grassy area next to the destroyed building. They were five of 30 confirmed killed in a Russian strike on a civilian neighborhood -- 79 were injured -- and at least 30 people remained unaccounted for.Even some of those pulled from the debris that was once their homes seemed to have only an uncertain grasp on life.""I have no words, I have no emotions, I feel nothing except a great emptiness inside,"" one 23-year-old woman, Anastasiia Shvets, wrote on social media.An image of Ms. Shvets from the scene of the attack struck a chord with Ukrainians across the country. It shows a young woman clutching a stuffed animal and a golden Christmas garland as she stands in the ruins and waits to be rescued.Ms. Shvets somehow emerged with only a small head wound and bruises on her legs.

Death Toll Rises After Russian Strike Destroys Apartment Block,Invasions; Nazi era; Missiles; Looting; Displaced persons; Apartments; Evacuations & rescues; Cities,"Enlarge this image.Rescuers on Sunday continued to comb the rubble of a nine-story apartment building that was cut in half by a Russian strike, as the death toll from the attack in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro a day earlier climbed to 30. It was one of the largest losses of civilian lives far from the front line since the beginning of the war.At least one woman was pulled safely from the debris. The 27-year-old was taken to a hospital where she was being treated for severe hypothermia, local officials said.The residential building was struck late Saturday afternoon as Russia launched dozens of missiles at cities across Ukraine in two waves of strikes that coincided with the Orthodox New Year and shattered the relative calm of recent days.By Sunday evening, 30 people had been confirmed dead, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service. At least 75 people were injured, and more than 30 people were still believed to be missing, local officials said.The strike on the apartment building is one of a series of devastating large-scale attacks on residential areas of Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February. Russian strikes on targets such as train stations, theaters, shopping malls and residential neighborhoods have led to significant loss of civilian life, while the shelling of cities and towns near the front line has also caused a mounting civilian death toll.Under international law, it is a war crime to deliberately or recklessly attack civilian populations and places where civilians would be likely to congregate.More than 550 people were involved in the rescue operation as it passed the 24-hour mark, local officials said.On Sunday morning, five victims who had been pulled from the rubble in Dnipro were laid out in body bags in a small grassy area next to the destroyed building. A light dusting of snow began to accumulate on them as the hours went by and recovery efforts continued.At least 400 people lived in the large apartment building and the immediate area around it, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, and 72 apartments were destroyed in the attack.

2 Claims for 1 Conquest Lay Bare a Russian Rift:   [Foreign Desk ],Invasions; Military engagements; Leadership; Failure; Defense,"After Russia's Defense Ministry said its troops had taken Soledar, a leader of the Wagner mercenary group accused the military of stealing credit. Ukraine said its forces were still fighting there.A Russian claim of victory on Friday in a town in eastern Ukraine exposed a growing rift in Moscow's war effort, as the Russian military and a private mercenary group contradicted each other publicly about who should get credit for the gains.Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement that its troops had taken control of the town, Soledar -- which would be Russia's largest battlefield success in months -- but made no mention of the Kremlin-affiliated Wagner private military company, which has ordered waves of troops into fighting in the region.Shortly after the Defense Ministry issued the statement on Friday, Andrei Troshev, a senior Wagner commander, accused the ministry of stealing ""other people's achievements."" Three days earlier, Wagner claimed that Soledar had fallen to its fighters, pointedly saying that the Russian army was not involved, only to have the Kremlin dispute the statement.After months of intense combat and heavy casualties, who actually controlled Soledar remained unclear on Friday. The Ukrainian military said its troops were still holding onto parts of the town, but that Russia had deployed significant forces in the area and that the situation was dynamic.Although taking control of the town would provide Russia with new positions for artillery facing the nearby city of Bakhmut, where fighting has raged for months, analysts say Soledar itself has little strategic value and is unlikely to significantly change the battle for eastern Ukraine.The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said on Thursday night that geo-located footage indicated that Moscow's forces ""likely control most if not all of Soledar,"" but said capture of the town was ""at best a Russian Pyrrhic tactical victory,"" gained at a steep cost.Most of Soledar has been reduced to shattered buildings, jagged rubble and shell craters, and most of its prewar population of about 10,000 has fled. But after months of Russian military setbacks -- a chaotic collapse in the northeast in September, a retreat from a major city in the south in November, and heavy losses in the east all the while -- Russian military leaders appeared to view the town as a symbolic prize worth competing for.The public quarrel between Wagner and the Russian military highlighted the deep rifts and disorganization that have plagued Russia's invasion of Ukraine since it began almost a year ago. Late Friday, the Russian military appeared to try to patch up the dispute by issuing a second statement, this one with a rare statement of public praise for the Wagner fighters.In the statement, the Defense Ministry said it needed to ""clarify"" that a ""heterogeneous"" group had worked together in Soledar. The direct assault of city blocks, the ministry said, ""was accomplished with the courageous and selfless actions of the Wagner PMC volunteer assault troops.""The founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has for months taken a greater prominence in Russia's war efforts, recruiting prisoners to join his troops, deploying his own fighter jets and tanks, and openly denigrating and taunting Russian generals. Analysts have said that Mr. Prigozhin, by seizing on Russian military failures in Ukraine and highlighting Wagner's role, has sought to raise his stature with President Vladimir V. Putin.In the battles for Soledar and Bakhmut, where Wagner troops have been engaged for months, Mr. Prigozhin has sought to portray himself as leading Russia's only successful offensive. He has shared videos that show him with soldiers in person, purporting to be near the front, and criticized military leaders for staying far from the fighting.On Friday, one of Mr. Prigozhin's companies quoted him on Telegram saying that Wagner faced a struggle against ""corruption, bureaucracy and officials who want to stay in their places,"" calling this a ""more serious threat"" to his company than the United States. He did not specify the officials he was referring to.In a statement on Friday night, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine reveled in the rift among the Russians and said his country's troops were still fighting in Soledar. ""They are already gnawing among themselves over who should be credited with some tactical advance,"" he said, adding that the dispute was ""a clear signal of failure for the enemy"" and an incentive for Ukraine to put more pressure on Russia.In a reflection of the shifting power dynamics within the Kremlin, the top commander of Russia's war effort -- a general praised by Mr. Prigozhin -- was abruptly replaced on Wednesday by Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, a longstanding member of Russia's military establishment.Mr. Gerasimov, the chief of the military general staff, was an architect of the invasion that has exposed to the world the dysfunction within Russia's vaunted military. Russian nationalists and war hawks have increasingly criticized his leadership of the armed forces in the wake of Russian defeats and struggles.The general he replaced, Sergei Surovikin, was widely regarded as a competent commander: In his three months overseeing the war effort, he ordered a retreat from Kherson, a major city in Ukraine's south, redeployed Russian troops to shore up defenses and concentrated efforts on eastern Ukraine. On Wednesday, he was named one of Mr. Gerasimov's deputies.The shake-up probably reflected systemic issues in the Russian military, Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, said on Thursday. He cited ""logistics problems, command and control problems, sustainment problems, morale and the large failure to achieve the strategic objectives that they've set for themselves.""Western officials say that Russia, Wagner and Ukraine have all suffered heavy losses in the region, especially as Russia and Wagner have sent waves of men into battle in an effort to overwhelm Ukraine's troops.Russian forces in the area far outnumber the Ukrainian troops who remain, according to people familiar with the matter on the Ukrainian side in the eastern Donbas region. They said the fighting was fierce and that resupply efforts were hindered by heavy Russian tank fire.Military analysts say that even if Soledar were to fall, it would not necessarily mean that Bakhmut -- or the whole of the Donbas -- was next.The White House's national security spokesman, John Kirby, when asked on Thursday about the status of Soledar, cautioned that it was important to ""keep this in perspective.""""We don't know how it's going to go, so I'm not going to predict failure or success here,"" he told reporters. ""But even if both Bakhmut and Soledar fall to the Russians, it's not going to make a -- it's not going to have a strategic impact on the war itself.""He added: ""If you look at what's been happening over the last 10 and a half months, particularly in the Donbas, towns and villages have swapped hands quite frequently.""Thomas Gibbons-Neff, Cassandra Vinograd and Carly Olson contributed reporting.Thomas Gibbons-Neff, Cassandra Vinograd and Carly Olson contributed reporting.Photograph A frame from a video released by the Russian Defense Ministry purportedly showed howitzers firing in eastern Ukraine.

"Russia is Sending More Troops to Eastern Ukraine, Kyiv Says",Invasions; Funerals; Alliances; Military personnel; Emergency services,"Enlarge this image.Russia is building up its forces in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian defense official said Thursday, as Moscow’s forces struggle on in their bid to capture a small salt-mining town in the east that has largely been reduced to rubble.The battle over Soledar has become emblematic of Moscow’s labored and costly offensive in eastern Ukraine.After days of intense street fighting, uncertainty over which side controlled the town of Soledar in Donetsk province remained Thursday, though there was no doubt about the devastation that had been wrought. Images released by the satellite company Maxar showed a score of apartment buildings and houses shattered beyond repair.Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, Hanna Maliar, said that “Russia is building up its forces in Ukraine but Ukrainian forces are holding out in fierce fighting for control of the eastern town of Soledar.”Citing the country’s intelligence service, she said Russia was moving troops trained in Belarus and Russia to the combat zone to focus on Donetsk and Luhansk provinces in the east of the country.Soledar and a number of other locations in the Bakhmut region “were subject to tank, mortar, barrel and rocket artillery attacks,” according to an update from Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces.The general staff bulletin claimed that about 100 Russian soldiers had been killed by Ukrainian special forces working with other front-line teams. It was not possible to confirm the figure independently.“The enemy is suffering great losses,” said Serhiy Cherevaty, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern forces.The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Thursday that “a huge amount of work has been done” in the battle for Soledar, but that “there is still a lot of work ahead.”While it is technically a city, Soledar had a prewar population of just 10,000 people. It lies about 6 miles from Bakhmut, a town with a prewar population of 70,000 that Russian forces have targeted since the summer, pouring in troops and attacking with artillery in the surrounding towns and villages.Russia sees Bakhmut as a gateway to the complete conquest of Donbas, the industrial region that includes Donetsk province. Moscow seized part of the region in 2014 and established breakaway republics.The Kremlin on Wednesday named Gen. Valery Gerasimov, who helped plan Russia’s stumbling invasion in February and who had served as Putin’s military chief of general staff for more than a decade, to replace Gen. Sergei Surovikin as the head of Russian forces in Ukraine.But that failed to reassure some Russian commentators, whose critical views of the conduct of the war have become increasingly influential.“The sum does not change, just by changing the places of its parts,” wrote one prominent blogger who goes by the name Rybar.If Russia were to take Soledar, it would be the first victory for Moscow’s forces after months of territorial gains by Ukraine in the northeast and south.“Ukraine starts the year in better shape than Russia. The Ukrainian Armed Force have momentum,” said Mick Ryan, a recently retired Australian army major general, noting the growing impact of air defense systems and weapons, which may soon include tanks, being supplied to Ukraine by its allies in Washington and Europe.

"Battle for Soledar Isn't Over, Ukraine Says",Invasions; Military vehicles; Mercenaries; Military air strikes; Military personnel; Emergency services,"Enlarge this image.KYIV, Ukraine — Fighting continued in the eastern Ukrainian town of Soledar on Wednesday, despite a claim by the founder of a mercenary force leading Russia’s offensive there that his troops had seized control of the town.President Volodymr Zelenksyy of Ukraine said at 7 p.m. local time that his forces were still holding Soledar and the nearby city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. He called the claim the town had been captured the work of “propagandists.”“But the fighting continues,” he said. “The Donetsk direction is holding out.

Ukraine Battles for Eastern Town as Russia Advances,Invasions; Military vehicles; Mercenaries; Military personnel,"Enlarge this image.KYIV, Ukraine — Intense fighting continued in the eastern Ukrainian town of Soledar on Wednesday, despite a claim by the founder of a mercenary force leading Russia’s offensive there that his troops had seized control of the town.A morning update from Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces gave no indication that the battle for Soledar, a small salt-mining municipality enmeshed in Russia’s quest to take a bigger city, Bakhmut, had ended. And Russia’s Defense Ministry and the Kremlin did not confirm the claim by the mercenary force, the Wagner private military company, that Soledar had fallen, saying that the town was only blocked for now.In the Russian Defense Ministry’s daily briefing, it said that its paratroopers “had blocked Soledar from the north and south” and that its assault units were “fighting in the city.” Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, urged reporters to wait for official announcements about whether the city had been captured, adding that “tactical successes are certainly very important as they come at a rather expensive price.”Peskov’s recommendation to wait for official announcements came days after the founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, asserted that it was his fighters who were leading the assault on Soledar and that he would be the one to announce its fall. On Tuesday, he circulated a photograph of himself purporting to be in a salt mine in Soledar and claimed that his forces had taken the city.On Wednesday, Prigozhin doubled down on his claim of full control over Soledar, saying that there was only some residual resistance in the mines.The competing claims over who has the authority to announce the fall of Soledar appeared to suggest growing strains between Russia’s military and Wagner. Prigozhin, an entrepreneur, is a longtime ally of President Vladimir Putin of Russia but has also been publicly critical of Russia’s Defense Ministry. He has become increasingly outspoken after acknowledging in September that he was the founder of the group.The group’s fighters have also been deployed in support of the Kremlin’s military campaigns in Africa and the Middle East. Wagner, which now includes recruited prisoners, has become the main force in the battle in the area of Bakhmut, and the fighting has been brutal.The claims played out in Russian media. Even as the Kremlin expressed caution, Russia’s Channel One — one of the two main state-run television networks — trumpeted in its news report Wednesday that Russian forces had achieved “a strategically important victory in the Donbas,” saying that “Soledar is under control.”The report said that Russian forces had pushed through a “labyrinth of underground strongholds” to capture Soledar. “The road is now open to other important towns,” the anchor said. No mention of Wagner was made.If Soledar did fall, the seizure of the relatively small municipality would be Russia’s first notable victory in months, after a string of humiliating losses. Ukraine changed the course of the war with its capture of the Kharkiv region in September and then the city of Kherson in November, successes of far greater magnitude.Moscow sees its campaign in the area around the city of Bakhmut as important to achieving its goal of occupying all of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. Military experts say that although taking Soledar would be significant, it would not signal that Bakhmut was about to fall into Russian hands. Ukraine has strongly reinforced its positions in the area, presenting a formidable obstacle to further progress by Moscow.The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research group, concluded in a Tuesday analysis that even if Russia captured Soledar, Ukraine could defend and resupply soldiers in Bakhmut.“The reality of block-by-block control of terrain in Soledar is obfuscated by the dynamic nature of urban combat,” the analysis said, though it noted that “Russian forces have largely struggled to make significant tactical gains in the Soledar area for months.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.",1.0
Russian Mercenaries Claim to Take Embattled Eastern Town,Artillery; Military personnel; Towns,"Enlarge this image.The founder of a Russian mercenary force leading Moscow’s assault on the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine claimed Tuesday that his troops had seized control of the town, according to the Russian state news agency TASS.The claim that Soledar had fallen to soldiers-for-hire working for Wagner Group could not be verified. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said on Twitter just before midnight local time that Russia was still trying to capture the town. The assault is part of Russia’s broader push in the area around the city of Bakhmut that Moscow sees as important to achieving its goal of occupying all of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.If true, the fall of Soledar, a relatively small municipality, would be Russia’s first significant victory in months, since Ukraine regained momentum with its capture of the Kharkiv region in September and then the city of Kherson in November, successes of far greater magnitude that changed the course of the war.The entrepreneur who started the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, maintained in a post on the Telegram messaging app that his troops had control, although he added that urban battles were still being fought in the town.In his nightly address Tuesday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine thanked the troops defending Soledar. “Today, I would like to pay special tribute to the warriors of the 46th separate airmobile brigade for their bravery and steadfastness in the defense of Soledar!” he said.How a tiny, salt-mining town with a prewar population of 10,000 people became a focus of such a sustained assault by Wagner’s forces has been an open question. In his overnight address Monday, Zelenskyy asked, “What did Russia want to gain there?”The most critical factor is perhaps not what Russian forces hope to gain in Soledar, but rather what Prigozhin and his mercenaries fighting there have to gain in terms of reputation. In Bakhmut, the Wagner Group, a private military contracting company that has recruited prisoners into its ranks, has become the main force leading the offensive for Russia, and the fighting has become bloodier.Before the emergence of the Wagner Group’s claims Tuesday, Britain’s Defense Ministry said in its daily intelligence update that Russian forces and the Wagner Group were likely now in control of most of Soledar after intense fighting over the past four days, The capture of the city, which is about 6 miles north of the city of Bakhmut, was likely to be part of “an effort to envelop Bakhmut from the north, and to disrupt Ukrainian lines of communication,” the update said.In his address Monday, Zelenskyy said that the fighting in Soledar was “extremely difficult” for Ukrainian forces, but that their resilience had “gained additional time and additional power for Ukraine.” “Everything is completely destroyed — there is almost no life left,” he said.The Ukrainian leader also said that thousands of fighters on Russia’s side had been killed there. “The whole land near Soledar is covered with the corpses of the occupiers and scars from the strikes,” he said. “This is what madness looks like.”A spokesperson for the eastern group of Ukraine’s army, Serhiy Cherevatyi, said on national television Tuesday that Russian artillery had struck Soledar 86 times over the past day. He said that the situation was “very challenging.”The tactics employed by the Wagner Group have resulted in a high number of casualties. In recent days, reporters for The New York Times embedded with a Ukrainian drone crew on the front line saw the bodies of Russian fighters scattered across open ground in the area around Bakhmut. Images and videos on Ukrainian social media in recent days also appear to have come from these aerial reconnaissance missions and show similar scenes.Prigozhin, a caterer and businessperson who is a close associate of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, is thought to want a victory in Bakhmut to boost his own political standing at home. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research group, noted in an analysis Monday that Prigozhin “continues to use reports of Wagner Group success in Soledar to bolster the Wagner Group’s reputation as an effective fighting force.”Prigozhin has emphasized that the group is the only Russian force fighting in Soledar, although Ukrainian officials and the Russian military say that Wagner is not the only group fighting for the city on Moscow’s behalf.Some Ukrainian messaging around the battle for Soledar on Tuesday appeared to suggest that losing control of the city to Russian forces would not be a major setback. Zelenskyy emphasized the importance of his forces’ broader goal of retaking the eastern Donbas region.“The result of this difficult and long battle will be the liberation of our entire Donbas,” he said in his overnight address.The larger battle is the fight for Bakhmut. For Russia, capturing it would be the most significant success in months.

Kyiv Commits To Tough Fight Over Bakhmut:   [Foreign Desk ],Invasions; War; Military engagements; Military strategy,"Earlier in the war, Ukraine's leadership was more equivocal about pitched battles with high casualties. There's no second-guessing this time. Some analysts say it makes sense strategically.BAKHMUT, Ukraine -- It was midmorning last Friday when the camera of a Ukrainian drone zoomed in on a Russian soldier moving furtively among trees on the edge of town. Another enemy assault was underway in the eastern city of Bakhmut.The drone pilot marked coordinates as he watched, then sent them by satellite link to artillery commanders.Within a few minutes, Ukrainian artillery units struck the houses where they had seen the Russians taking cover. Smoke from the hits could be seen rising silently on the drone operator's screen.Later that day, however, an armored vehicle rumbled out of an eastern neighborhood carrying wounded Ukrainian soldiers toward a stabilization point in the city's west. Ukraine's army was taking its hits, too.It's a grim stalemate that has taken on the rhythms of a heavyweight title bout, with each side going toe to toe in one of the longest-running battles of the war. That stands in contrast to Ukraine's strategy elsewhere along the front line, where it succeeded by avoiding direct confrontations, relying instead on nimble maneuvers, deception and Western-provided long-range weapons to force Russian retreats.In an earlier phase of the war, Ukraine's leadership had been more equivocal about pitched battles like Bakhmut. President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a rare moment of public self-doubt, mulled then whether the deaths of about 100 Ukrainian soldiers per day in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk were worth the fight for two already ruined cities.But this time, there has been no second-guessing. And new research suggests the lethal urban combat last summer was not as senseless as it might have seemed at the time.An analysis by two leading military analysts published last month by the Foreign Policy Research Institute vindicated the attritional fighting. The pitched battle weakened the Russian Army enough for two Ukrainian counterattacks in the fall to succeed, wrote the analysts, Rob Lee and Michael Kofman. Those offensives, in the Kharkiv region in the north and Kherson in the south, delivered two of the most embarrassing defeats of the war to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.""The amount of ammunition Russia expended and the casualties they took set up the Russian Army for failure,"" Mr. Lee said in an interview.Whether Bakhmut winds up playing a similar role ahead of expected spring offensives by Ukraine depends on many variables, he said, including how many soldiers Russia can field after a mobilization this past fall.Fierce fighting continued to rage on Monday along the front line that extends from Bakhmut northeast toward the city of Soledar, with the Russians claiming to have taken a nearby village and Ukraine saying that it had repelled Russian attempts to storm Soledar itself.Ukraine's deputy defense minister, Hanna Maliar, said in a post on Telegram that after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Soledar and subsequent retreat, the enemy regrouped ""and launched a powerful assault."" Ukrainian forces were ""bravely defending every inch,"" she wrote.At the Pentagon on Monday, a senior U.S. military official described the combat in and around Bakhmut as ""really severe and savage"" with both sides slugging it out.Bakhmut's strategic value is debatable, but it carries symbolic importance for both sides. For Russia, capturing it would be the most significant success in months. In Ukraine, the long battle and heavy losses have turned Bakhmut into a national symbol of defiance. Mr. Zelensky cited the city in a high-profile appearance before the U.S. Congress last month, and presented House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a Ukrainian flag signed by soldiers fighting in Bakhmut.(The imperative to ""Hold Bakhmut,"" as Ukrainians say, nevertheless carries some risks, analysts warn, saying that it could cloud military judgment and potentially delay a retreat if one becomes necessary).Viewed from the sky, on the monitor of a drone pilot, Bakhmut slides silently by in sepia hues of brown mud roads, gray rubble of homes and white smoke rising from fires. The stalemate has transformed a swath of ruins and mangled, muddy fields on the city's eastern rim into scenes reminiscent of World War I: Shell craters are ubiquitous, and the abandoned bodies of Russian soldiers lie about, with Ukrainian troops often complaining of the stink.""It's a place like Verdun in the First World War, where each side is trying to bleed out the other,"" Lt. Gen. Frederick B. Hodges, the former American commanding general in Europe, said of the battle of Bakhmut, now in its sixth month.A drone overflight of the wasteland on Thursday recorded a typical scene: two Russian bodies lying on the battlefield beside an artillery crater. ""It looks like apocalypse,"" Pvt. Oleksiy Kondakov, a Ukrainian soldier who rotated out of Bakhmut last month, said of the area.Inside the city, few civilians remain, most on the less heavily damaged western bank of the small river that divides Bakhmut, the Bakhmutovka. The eastern neighborhoods are panoramas of collapsed and burned houses.Soldiers settle into a familiar routine. Last Friday, a team of Ukrainians careened down a muddy street in a sport utility vehicle, wheeled into a courtyard and piled out, standing next to a wall with rifles ready, just as they do most days.Inside the relative safety of a ruined building, one soldier set about unspooling cable for a satellite link. Another unpacked a drone. They exchanged pleasantries with another unit that happened to be using the same devastated building that day, sharing tea with them and ignoring the booms and rattle of gunfire outside.In czarist times, the city was a trading hub in eastern Ukraine and a center of salt mining. The Soviet authorities renamed it Artyomovsk, after a Bolshevik who helped quash a short-lived Ukrainian independent republic in the early 1920s. Before Russia's invasion, it was home to red brick merchant houses and universities, nestled between rolling, grassy hills in the eastern Donbas region.Today, about 7,000 people remain of the city's prewar population of about 100,000, according to Tetiana Scherbak, a director of a volunteer soup kitchen on the western bank, where a few dozen civilians huddled around a wood stove on Friday, warming their hands and charging phones from a generator.In the central square, heedless of the explosions, on some days a drunken woman spirals and dances, arms out like a child mimicking the flight of an airplane. She is a character known to the locals who have remained.""Everybody suffers"" in her own way, said Svitlana Shpachenko, 54, a former accountant warming up at the soup kitchen.The battle in Bakhmut has been fought in two phases: for the first 100 days or so the Russian regular army was involved, and from then on a private military contracting company, the Wagner Group, which has recruited prisoners into its ranks.The second phase has been the bloodier one, as the Russians have assaulted the city using brigades made up of the convicts. The company's owner, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, who is a close associate of President Vladimir V. Putin and is seen as wanting a victory in Bakhmut to boost his political standing back in Russia, tested new tactics.Many of these units were essentially throwaway soldiers; Ukrainian soldiers have called them human wave assaults.""Essentially they take the brunt of whatever Ukrainian response there is,"" said the senior American military official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational details. ""Then you have better trained forces that move behind them to claim the ground that these individuals have walked over.""Serhiy Hrabsky, a former Ukrainian colonel and commentator for the Ukrainian news media, called the fighting around Bakhmut ""a completely different nature"" of war. Ukraine persists in the city's defense, he said, in part because ""their losses are important for us.""The attack on Friday was a case in point.The Russians were moving forward from the forest into the town on foot, with no armored vehicles to be seen by the drone flying overhead. On the screen, the readings of altitude and range ticked up and down.""Without eyes, we lose people,"" said the drone pilot, who asked to be identified by his nickname, Navara, in keeping with Ukrainian military policy. ""And we cannot lose people. We have fewer anyway.""Navara asked not to reveal precise locations but said it could generally be said of the Russians moving into town that ""the bastards are about 800 meters that way,"" pointing a finger out the broken window of the building.Not long afterward, Ukrainian artillery hit the Russians as they took cover in an area of deserted and mostly destroyed one- and two-story homes.

Those offensives, in the Kharkiv region in the north and Kherson in the south, delivered two of the most embarrassing defeats of the war to President Vladimir Putin of Russia.“The amount of ammunition Russia expended and the casualties they took set up the Russian army for failure,” Lee said in an interview.Whether Bakhmut winds up playing a similar role before expected spring offensives by Ukraine depends on many variables, he said, including how many soldiers Russia can field after a mobilization this past fall and the ratio of contractors to regular army soldiers Russia is losing around Bakhmut.Fierce fighting continued to rage on Monday along the front line that extends from Bakhmut northeast toward the city of Soledar, with the Russians claiming to have taken a nearby village and Ukraine saying that it had repelled Russian attempts to storm Soledar itself.Viewed from the sky, on the monitor of a drone pilot, Bakhmut slides silently by in sepia hues of brown mud roads, gray rubble of homes and white smoke rising from fires. The stalemate has transformed a swath of ruins and mangled, muddy fields on the city’s eastern rim into scenes reminiscent of World War I: Shell craters are ubiquitous, and the abandoned bodies of Russian soldiers lie about, with Ukrainian troops often complaining of the stink.“It’s a place like Verdun in the First World War, where each side is trying to bleed out the other,” Gen. Frederick Hodges, the former U.S. commanding general in Europe, said of the battle of Bakhmut, now in its sixth month.A drone overflight of the wasteland Thursday recorded a typical scene: two Russian bodies lying on the battlefield beside an artillery crater. “It looks like apocalypse,” Pvt. Oleksiy Kondakov, a Ukrainian soldier who rotated out of Bakhmut last month, said of the area.Inside the city, few civilians remain, most on the less heavily damaged western bank of the small river that divides Bakhmut, the Bakhmutovka. The eastern neighborhoods are panoramas of collapsed and burned houses.Soldiers settle into a familiar routine. Last Friday, a team of Ukrainians careened down a muddy street in an SUV, wheeled into a courtyard and piled out, standing next to a wall with rifles ready, just as they do most days.Inside the relative safety of a ruined building, one soldier set about unspooling cable for a satellite link. Another unpacked a drone. They exchanged pleasantries with another unit that happened to be using the same devastated building that day, sharing tea with them and ignoring the booms and rattle of gunfire outside.In czarist times, the city was a trading hub in eastern Ukraine and a center of salt mining. The Soviet authorities renamed it Artyomovsk, after a Bolshevik who helped quash a short-lived Ukrainian independent republic in the early 1920s. Before Russia’s invasion, it was home to red brick merchant houses and universities, nestled between rolling, grassy hills in the eastern Donbas region.Today, about 7,000 people remain of the city’s prewar population of about 100,000, according to Tetiana Scherbak, a director of a volunteer soup kitchen on the western bank, where a few dozen civilians huddled around a wood stove Friday, warming their hands and charging phones from a generator.In the central square, heedless of the explosions, on some days a drunken woman spirals and dances, arms out like a child mimicking the flight of an airplane. She is a character known to the locals who have remained.“Everybody suffers” in her own way, said Svitlana Shpachenko, 54, a former accountant warming up at the soup kitchen.In Ukraine, the long battle and heavy losses have turned Bakhmut into a national symbol of defiance. While this has provided a beleaguered citizenry a proud rallying cry, some analysts say it risks clouding military judgment, delaying a retreat if one becomes necessary. A Russian advance might also be stopped from the high ground to the west of the city, they point out.The battle in Bakhmut has been fought in two phases: for the first 100 days or so the Russian regular army was involved, and from then on a private military contracting company, the Wagner Group, which has recruited prisoners into its ranks.The second phase has been the bloodier one, as the Russians have assaulted the city using brigades made up of the convicts. The company’s owner, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, who is a close associate of President Vladimir Putin and is seen as wanting a victory in Bakhmut to boost his political standing back in Russia, tested new tactics.Many of these units were essentially throwaway soldiers put into what Lee, the military analyst, called “not-well-supported infantry offensives.” Ukrainian soldiers have called them human wave assaults.“It’s a completely different nature” of war than elsewhere in Ukraine, Serhiy Hrabsky, a former Ukrainian colonel and commentator for the Ukrainian news media, said of the fighting around Bakhmut. Ukraine persists in the city’s defense, he said, in part because “their losses are important for us.”The attack Friday was a case in point.The Russians were moving forward from the forest into the town on foot, with no armored vehicles to be seen by the drone flying overhead. On the screen, the readings of altitude and range ticked up and down.“Without eyes, we lose people,” said the drone pilot, who asked to be identified by his nickname, Navara, in keeping with Ukrainian military policy. “And we cannot lose people. We have fewer anyway.”Navara asked not to reveal precise locations but said it could generally be said of the Russians moving into town that “the bastards are about 800 meters that way,” pointing a finger out the broken window of the building.Not long afterward, Ukrainian artillery hit the Russians as they took cover in an area of deserted and mostly destroyed one- and two-story homes. In the streets of the neighborhood a firefight was picking up, and the clatter of machine guns echoed about.After a few flights, the drone team drove out by another road, avoiding the street fighting.Private Andriy Pancheko, a member of the drone team, had been working as an electrician in Poland before the invasion but returned and volunteered in the army. Broadly, he said, Ukrainians were defending their country because “if we don’t fight, we won’t have freedom.”The purpose of holding out specifically in the ruins of eastern Bakhmut was less clear, he admitted. “I don’t know, I just take orders,” he said. “They commanded me to be here. But why not? It’s our land.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.",1.0
Ukraine Moves ‘Step by Step’ as Pace Slows in Carrying Out Offensives in East,Invasions; Military withdrawals,"Enlarge this image.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine started with an eruption of firepower last winter, as its forces poured across the border and launched a multipronged assault. In late summer, Ukraine launched a lightning offensive of its own, routing Russian troops from the northeast.Now, 10 months into the war, the tempo of the fighting has been slower for both sides. Even as Russian forces claimed gains Monday around the eastern city of Bakhmut, which it has been trying for months to seize, there was little sign that dug-in Ukrainian forces would relinquish the city any time soon.“We are moving forward little by little, step by step,” Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, Hanna Maliar, said Sunday in a post on the Telegram social messaging app.While she was referring to fighting in the eastern area known as Donbas, her assessment could be applied to the conflict as a whole.As the one-year mark of the war approaches, less territory is changing hands. Autumn rains turned the ground into mud, a challenge for fighting vehicles. But both sides have signaled an intention to carry out new offensives, not least Ukraine, which seeks to recapture all of the territory Russia has seized since 2014.Military experts say that several factors explain the slower pace and seemingly smaller gains. Among them are the relative density of Russian forces in Donbas; the natural barrier posed by the Dnieper River in the south of the country, which has impeded Ukraine’s advance; the need by Ukraine to conserve and reconstitute its forces after a series of battles; and the winter weather, which has posed difficulties for both sides.“It felt going into the winter that the Russian military was the most vulnerable and the job of the Ukrainian military was to press the Russian military, to prevent force reconstitution, to maintain the initiative heading into the winter and the spring and then conduct an offensive at the time of their choosing,” said Michael Kofman, director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Virginia. “That’s not how things have played out.”He said that Russian forces had imposed on Ukraine a “difficult, grinding fight” around two cities in Donbas: Bakhmut, in the Donetsk region, and Kreminna in the Luhansk region.Russian forces have been trying to take Bakhmut since the summer, and fierce fighting was raging near the city Monday, amid competing claims about potential Russian advances in the area.The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, told Ukrainian television Sunday that weather was posing a challenge to both sides and that heavy equipment was getting stuck in soft ground.“In a day or two, it will freeze seriously, and it will be possible to drive normally without worrying about the fact that a tank or other equipment might get stuck,” he said. “I hope that the advantage will be on our side.”Russian forces are still inflicting great pain on Ukrainians, unleashing waves of missiles and exploding drones aimed at crippling the country’s energy infrastructure. While President Vladimir Putin ordered a brief cease-fire over the weekend to observe Orthodox Christmas, there was little change in the scale of fighting. Ukraine, too, has delivered significant blows, including a strike on a Russian military barracks in Donetsk over the New Year holiday that Moscow acknowledged killed at least 89 Russian soldiers, although Ukraine claimed the toll was in the hundreds.Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia might sharply escalate the war in a winter offensive. And the new armored vehicles that Western allies offered to Ukraine last week signaled they were gearing up for another bloody year of fighting, as Ukraine seeks to dislodge dug-in Russian forces.On Sunday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, acknowledged that “the situation on the front line has not changed significantly in the first week of the year.” In his nightly address, he stressed the need for “resilience.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.",1.0
Fighting for Ukraine to Take Revenge on Russia:   [Foreign Desk ],Invasions; Military policy; Oppression; Prisoners of war & missing in action; Minority & ethnic groups; Political leadership; War; Nazi groups; Volunteers; Military personnel; Military history; Armed forces,"KYIV REGION, Ukraine -- The sharp crack of sniper fire rang out across the snowbound valley. Soldiers in white camouflage crouched low, shooting at the hill opposite to provide cover as four men evacuated a casualty.The action was part of a live-fire training exercise for new recruits on a recent morning outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. But there was an unusual element to the event. While a Ukrainian Army officer was giving the orders, the trainees were members of a volunteer Chechen battalion that also mixed in some Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians.Ukraine's military commanders have long said they do not lack soldiers for the war, but they have nonetheless welcomed to their ranks thousands of volunteers, including foreign citizens. Many of them, like the Chechens, are refugees from Russia itself. Others have come from surrounding nations, like Georgia, that have a history of opposition to Moscow and the leadership of President Vladimir V. Putin.""We saw what was happening,"" said Muslim Madiyev, a gray-bearded deputy commander of the Chechen battalion, wearing ear protectors to muffle the sound of gunfire as he watched the training exercises. ""Ukraine has no shortage of men, but we have to join and be a part of this war.""Many of the volunteers were already living in Ukraine, either for work or seeking refuge from political oppression back home. Some volunteers have struggled with visas and residency permits, while their eagerness to join the fight has aroused suspicions among some Ukrainian officials and commanders, who are on high alert for saboteurs.But the volunteers seem to be finding their place. Mr. Madiyev, a veteran of two wars in Chechnya against Moscow, was an associate of Dzhokhar Dudayev, the former Soviet general who led Chechnya's bid for independence from Russia in the 1990s. Exiled from Chechnya, Mr. Madiyev settled in Ukraine in 2016.His battalion, named for the late Chechen leader, is one of several Chechen units that have joined Ukraine in its fight against Russia in recent years, following the 2014 uprising of Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea. Mr. Madiyev declined to reveal how many active fighters he had, saying simply, ""We have enough.""He spoke about the Russian invasion the way many Ukrainians do, saying that if Moscow is not stopped in Ukraine, it will threaten many more countries of Europe.But the younger fighters in his battalion take things further.""Our aim is the liberation of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria,"" a Chechen fighter said, using the name of the erstwhile self-declared republic, ""and to help all the nations who want it, to gain freedom."" In accordance with military protocol, he gave only his code name, Maga.The Chechens are only one example of numerous ethnic-based battalions and regiments that have been forming in Ukraine since Russia's invasion last February.Fighters from Belarus have formed a regiment thousands strong. Other volunteers come from the Caucasus and Central Asia, as well as from ethnic minorities that have large populations in Russia: Chechens, Tatars and Turkic-speaking groups.Most of them are motivated by historical grievances of dispossession and suppression by Moscow. Chechens and Tatars were among many groups that were decimated by forcible deportations under Stalin in the 1940s.There is also a smattering of Russian exiles, among them Russian nationalists and neo-Nazis who are opposed to Mr. Putin. A thousands-strong regiment of Belarusians includes many opponents of the country's president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko.Their participation in the war may be useful for Ukraine, but it is also a potentially explosive issue for the Kyiv government because most of them harbor long-term political ambitions to return home and overthrow the Russian and Belarusian governments. Ukrainian military officials declined to comment on their use of the volunteer groups, while a spokesman for the Ukrainian security service, the S.B.U., said it was not responsible for managing them.But the volunteers themselves say that they are acting with the full knowledge and under the orders of the Ukrainian Army and intelligence services. Many of their operations are covert, including dangerous reconnaissance or sabotage missions behind Russian lines.In response to an appeal by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, early in the war, thousands of volunteers poured in from Western countries, including the United States and Britain. Most joined the International Legion, which has been recognized by the Ukrainian government and, to some extent, integrated into the Ukrainian Army.At a news briefing last month, Ukraine's defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said there were ideological and political benefits to having foreign soldiers fighting alongside Ukrainians in defense of European values.Foreign soldiers were also gaining valuable experience, he added: ""The experience of the modern war here, the war of technologies, drone war and electronic warfare. So I think it's a win-win exchange.""But the volunteers from former Soviet republics are, in many ways, even more useful.They have a linguistic advantage because most speak Russian, which is widely spoken in Ukraine, and sometimes Ukrainian, making coordination with the Ukrainian military easier. And some, like a group of Georgians in the Kavkaz Legion, have battlefield experience, having served with the NATO-led force in Afghanistan.Their knowledge of Russia and Russians, and their hatred of Moscow, has made the volunteers good undercover operators for Kyiv. Some Ukrainian officials and lawmakers have even expressed support for their causes. In October, for example, the Ukrainian Parliament passed a motion recognizing the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria as a territory occupied by Russia.But they also face substantial risks, given the nature of their work behind enemy lines. Not just Russian citizens, but virtually any undercover soldiers captured by Russian forces would be dealt with harshly.One of the more recently formed volunteer battalions, Turan, is composed of Turkic-speaking ethnic groups from the Caucasus, Central Asia and Russia. It is led by a refugee from Kyrgyzstan, Almaz Kudabek, who had worked as a barber on American bases in his home country and in the Afghan city of Kandahar.He says he has recruited Azerbaijanis, Tatars and Chinese Uyghurs to the group, and he talks passionately about the marginalization and oppression of Turkic-speaking minorities in Russia. He said that Moscow had unfairly drawn conscripts for the war predominantly from remote and poorer regions of Russia, including those populated by Turkic-speaking ethnic minorities, who have been killed in far greater numbers than ethnic Russians.But Mr. Kudabek said members of his unit could turn that injustice to their advantage, infiltrating Russian-occupied territory on sabotage missions and even passing themselves off as Russian soldiers.""We just want to fight Russians,"" he said. ""We know what they are.""Despite their evident value to the Ukrainian military, the commanders of ethnic battalions complained of a lack of support from Kyiv. The Chechen battalion leader, Mr. Madiyev, said that beyond weapons and ammunition, the units have to provide for their own food, fuel and equipment.The leader of a Russian regiment, a far-right nationalist who uses the code name White Rex, said he ran into multiple obstacles when he formed the unit shortly after the Russians invaded.Although he and his fellow volunteers had lived in Ukraine for several years, they were initially met with suspicion from Ukrainians on edge about Russian saboteurs. ""We were held at gunpoint,"" he said. ""We had many funny, and not so funny, encounters, but I was determined to have this regiment.""But they have also found support among Ukrainians.A Ukrainian volunteer group, Bratstvo, eventually helped the Russian regiment find a role for itself not so dissimilar from the other ethnic battalions, operating behind Russian lines and carrying out reconnaissance and sabotage missions for the Ukrainian Army.Minutes before setting out on a night mission recently, White Rex said his aim had always been to find a way to return home to Russia. But he said the war had taught him that the way to return to Russia was to overthrow Mr. Putin and his government.""The Russian Volunteer Corps marches in and destroys the current government -- that's the only way,"" he said. ""You cannot persuade a tyrant to leave, and any other force would be seen as invaders.""Oleksandr Chubko contributed reporting.Oleksandr Chubko contributed reporting.Photograph Members of a Chechen battalion training with new recruits outside Kyiv, Ukraine, last month.

"Ukraine Keeps Downing Russian Drones, but Price Tag Is High",Invasions; Military policy; Military aircraft; Infrastructure; Energy industry; Assaults; Ammunition; War; New year; Drones; Missiles,"Enlarge this image.Exploding drones are lumbering and noisy and relatively easy to shoot from the sky and, over the New Year’s weekend, Ukraine says, its military downed every single one of about 80 that Russia sent the country’s way.“Such results have never been achieved before,” a Ukrainian air force spokesperson said Tuesday.But some military experts wonder if the successes are sustainable.Ukraine is getting more and more skilled at knocking down drones, but there is a growing imbalance: Many of its defensive weapons like surface-to-air missiles cost far more than the drones do. And that, some military experts say, may favor Moscow over the long haul.Artem Starosiek, the head of Molfar, a Ukrainian consultancy that supports the country’s war effort, estimated that it costs up to seven times more to down a drone with a missile than it does to launch one. That is an equation that the Kremlin may be banking on, some analysts say.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, in an overnight speech, warned that Russia was betting on the “exhaustion of our people, our air defense, our energy sector.”Ukraine has vowed not to be cowed by the aerial assault, but the attacks have been unrelenting.Molfar said its group estimated that, since September, Russia had launched around 600 drones at Ukraine. The campaign, targeted at infrastructure and accompanied by numerous missile strikes, has knocked out power, heating and water across Ukraine just as the country’s harsh winter has started to bite, compounding the misery of a Russian invasion that is nearing its first anniversary.The Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones that Moscow has increasingly been relying on since October are relatively uncomplicated devices and fairly cheap, while the array of weapons used to shoot them out of the sky can be much pricier, according to experts. The self-destructing drones can cost as little as $20,000 to produce, while the cost of firing a surface-to-air missile can range from $140,000 for a Soviet-era S-300 to $500,000 for a missile from an American NASAMS, or National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System.Since the war began in February, both sides have used drones not just for reconnaissance but also for attacks. It is the first time the devices have been so widely deployed in a European war. Some military experts view Ukraine as a testing ground for state-of-the-art weapons and information systems that may foreshadow the shape of warfare for generations to come.Military authorities in Kyiv have said little about the details of their air defenses — in keeping with the operational secrecy that has shrouded much of their war planning — or about the cost, making analysis difficult.But it is known that while Ukraine’s forces have enjoyed some success against drones using anti-aircraft guns and even small-arms fire, that has changed as the Russians have taken to launching assaults at night. Now Kyiv is also relying heavily on missiles fired from warplanes and the ground. Over the weekend, officials said, Ukraine employed surface-to-air missiles fired from NASAMS multiple times to counter drones.Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the CNA research institute, said that Ukrainians were using “a zoo of different air defense systems” to combat the threat, including Soviet-era and NATO missile systems, each with its own cost profile.Some of Ukraine’s anti-aircraft guns, like the Gepard 2 radar-directed mobile gun system, are inexpensive in comparison with other Soviet-era and European defense systems being deployed. But some of the American-made interceptor missiles are fairly expensive compared with drones.Even so, evaluating the wisdom of downing drones with missiles is not always straightforward.George Barros, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, said he suspected that Ukraine was deploying more complex and expensive air defense systems to protect sensitive and critical infrastructure.It costs far less, for example, to shoot down a drone than to repair a destroyed power station, Starosiek noted. And then there is the human factor.“People are still alive,” he said.Mathieu Boulegue, a consulting fellow with the Russia and Eurasia Program at Chatham House, a London-based research organization, said that Ukraine currently had enough air defense weapons and ammunition to combat the threat of Russian drones.“The cost is irrelevant as long as the West keeps providing military assistance to Ukraine,” Boulegue said. “The problem for Kyiv is the moment they don’t have enough stock of ammunition in their air defense chain to shoot down these drones.”Aware of the risk that Western allies may grow weary of the cost of supporting Ukraine’s defense — a concern heightened by the transfer of leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives to Republicans — Ukrainian officials have warned that Russian tactics are changing.The White House has said that it is aware of reports that the Kremlin and Iran are seeking to establish a joint production line for drones in Russia. Over the long term, Boulegue said, that would allow Moscow to deploy still more drones in attacks.“That is going to put more stress on Ukraine’s air defense system,” he said.That helps explain why Ukraine has adapted its own tactics, in part by conducting strikes on bases deep inside Russian territory. The goal, Boulegue said, is “to increase deterrence, which they hope will place less stress on air defense.”For now, Moscow has changed how it is using the drones it already has in hand.Russian forces have increasingly been launching their explosive drones at night and low along the Dnieper River, making it harder for Ukraine to detect them, according to Yurii Ihnat, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force, who was speaking on Ukrainian radio.“The radar antenna that detects the target will not see it if the target is flying below the level of the antenna,” he said.

Ukrainian Forces Grow More Adept at Defending Against Russian Drones,Infrastructure; Energy industry; Assaults; Humanitarianism; Drones; New year; Holidays & special occasions; Military air strikes; Military personnel,"Enlarge this image.Ukraine shot down all of the exploding drones that Russia had fired over the new year, a Ukrainian air force spokesperson said on Tuesday, in a measure of the country’s growing ability to resist Moscow’s effort to incapacitate its energy infrastructure.“Such results have never been achieved before,” the spokesperson, Yurii Ihnat, said on Ukrainian television, referring to the nights of Dec. 31 and Jan. 1.Russia launched its latest swarm of the Iranian-made weapons, nicknamed “flying mopeds” for their relatively slow speed, at targets inside Ukraine on Monday. None reached their destination because of anti-aircraft guns, surface-to-air missiles and warplanes, a rare shutout. Twenty drones were downed over Kyiv alone.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine said his military began the new year by putting up stiff resistance to the unmanned attacks from above.“Only two days have passed since the beginning of the year, and the number of Iranian drones shot down over Ukraine is already more than 80,” Zelenskyy said late Monday in his nightly address.In October, about a month after Russia began deploying the Shahed drones, an adviser to Ukraine’s defense minister said that they were shooting down more than 70% of the drones.As winter bites, the fighting on the ground in Ukraine has become a war of attrition, and the focus has shifted to the struggle in the air over Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and other major cities.Russia has launched wave after wave of drone and cruise missile attacks aimed at knocking out electricity and water supplies to civilians, leaving as much as 25% of the nation without power at times. Monday’s drone attack is the latest in a series of year-end assaults, including one that killed three civilians on New Year’s Eve.Given that Ukraine’s defensive measures cost more than Russia’s aerial attack methods, some military experts fear a growing imbalance that could, over time, favor Russia. In his nightly address Monday, Zelenskyy said his government had intelligence suggesting that there was no end in sight to the Russian attacks using Shaheds.“We have information that Russia is planning a prolonged attack with Shaheds,” he said, according to a transcript put out by his office. “Its bet may be on exhaustion — on exhaustion of our people, our air defense, our energy sector.”But, with each attack, Ukraine’s forces are getting better at taking out the drones before they hit their target, giving Ukraine what Zelenskyy called small “victories over terrorists and terror.”“Each shot-down drone, each shot-down missile, each day with electricity for our people and minimal schedules of blackouts are exactly such victories,” he said.One reason for the success against the drone campaign might be the United States’ decision in early November to provide Ukraine with an advanced surface-to-air missile system, known as NASAMS. It includes radar, sensors, launchers and a mobile command center.According to the Center for Strategic Communication and Information Security, a Ukrainian government agency, the U.S. missile system played a role in Monday’s assault.“Despite having learned to operate them only a few weeks ago, our military used them almost like artillery, reloading them as fast as possible,” the center said on Twitter. “The highly successful use of these weapons show that our soldiers learn fast.”Mick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and retired CIA officer, said training had helped Ukrainian forces get better and better at managing sophisticated weaponry.Russia, on the other hand, he said, seemed to be giving up on the idea of winning the war with a traditional land fight, at least in the near future.“It appears their fallback is just to blow the country to smithereens,” he said. “You can’t win a war by airstrikes.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.",1.0
Deadly Strike on Russians in Ukraine Exposes Moscow’s Military Failings,Invasions; Infrastructure; Ammunition; New year; Missiles; Military personnel; Armed forces; Cities,"Enlarge this image.In one of their deadliest attacks yet on Russian forces, Ukrainians used American-made rockets to kill dozens — and perhaps hundreds — of Moscow’s troops in a New Year’s Day strike behind the lines, prompting outraged Russian war hawks to accuse their military of lethal incompetence.The strike by the HIMARS rockets killed 63 Russian soldiers in a building housing them in the occupied city of Makiivka, in eastern Ukraine, the Russian Defense Ministry said Monday — an unusual admission for a military that has often refused to acknowledge serious losses. A former Russian paramilitary commander in Ukraine, Igor Girkin, wrote on the Telegram app that “many hundreds” were dead and wounded and that many “remained under the rubble.”Ukrainian military officials said it appeared that “about 400” Russian troops had been killed, though they did not explicitly say that Ukraine was behind the attack.None of the claims could be independently verified, but even the lowest number would represent one of the worst Russian losses in a single episode in the war, and an embarrassment for President Vladimir Putin of Russia. He has vowed repeatedly to correct the glaring errors and weaknesses in his armed forces that the war has exposed, and in a New Year’s Eve speech filmed at a military base, Putin told the families of soldiers killed in the fighting, “I share your pain with all my heart.”Pro-war Russian bloggers and some government officials said the debacle was caused by the military’s own repeated and costly mistakes, like garrisoning troops in a dense concentration within range of Ukrainian artillery, placing them in the same building as an ammunition depot, and allowing them to use cellphones, whose signals the Ukrainians can use to zero in on their target.“Our generals are untrainable in principle,” wrote Girkin, who has used the nom de guerre Igor Strelkov.Some pro-war lawmakers demanded an investigation, and one of them, Sergei Mironov, leader of a pro-Kremlin party in the parliament, called for the prosecution of all officials responsible, “whether they wear epaulets or not.”“Obviously neither intelligence nor counterintelligence or air defense worked properly,” he said.The attack was “a massive blow,” said a spokesperson for the Russian-installed proxy government in the Donetsk region, Daniil Bezsonov. “The enemy inflicted the most serious defeats in this war on us not because of their coolness and talent, but because of our mistakes,” he wrote in a Telegram post.More than 10 months after an invasion that Russians — and many Ukrainians — thought would produce a quick Russian victory, each side has suffered more than 100,000 killed and wounded, by Western estimates, and the war has become one of attrition, with no evidence of an end in sight.Some of the heaviest recent fighting has ravaged the Donetsk region, one of four the Kremlin claimed to annex in September even as its troops were losing ground there, giving up towns they had seized earlier in the war. Since then combat in the region has slowed to a bloody slog, as Ukrainians look for places to press their advantage, while Russians build trenches and fortifications along the front lines and try to capture the city of Bakhmut.On Monday, Russia launched a flurry of Iranian-made exploding drones at Ukraine, continuing its barrage against cities and civilian infrastructure, especially the power grid. But it appeared that Ukraine’s increasingly effective air defenses once again minimized the damage.The Ukrainian military said Monday that 22 drones were shot down over Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, in the early morning hours, but at least two loud explosions were heard in the city. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said some energy infrastructure facilities had been damaged, affecting systems that heat buildings. It was not clear if the explosions were caused by drones that evaded air defenses, by drones that were shot down but detonated on hitting the ground, or by air defense missiles.The Ukraine military said it had shot down all 45 Iranian Shahed drones launched over the weekend, although some cruise missiles penetrated its defenses.In his nightly video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine warned Monday, “We have information that Russia is planning a prolonged attack with Shaheds,” aiming to exhaust Ukraine’s defenses and its ability to endure. He said, “Now is the time when everyone involved in the protection of the sky should be especially attentive.”The deadly attack on Russian forces in Makiivka used the HIMARS rocket artillery to hit a vocational school where troops were housed, Moscow said. The Russian Defense Ministry said that four HIMARS rockets had hit the building, and that two others had been shot down by Russian air defenses.As pro-war bloggers and officials reacted with fury, video posted on social media showed firefighters amid the ruins of the structure, reduced to smoking piles of rubble. The bloggers have become influential opinion-makers in Russia amid the censorship of mainstream media.Girkin, the blogger and former paramilitary commander, wrote that the vocational school in Makiivka had been “almost completely destroyed” because “ammunition stored in the same building” detonated in the strike. The ammunition was stored “without the slightest sign of disguise,” he wrote, adding that similar strikes had occurred earlier this year, albeit with fewer casualties.Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at Rand Corp., noted that the Russian officials “do not typically provide this type of information after a major loss, which suggests they want to control the narrative on this event.”Makiivka, adjacent to the city of Donetsk, lies only about 10 miles from the nearest Ukrainian-held territory, the town of Avdiivka to the northwest — well within the roughly 50-mile range of the HIMARS rockets the United States has sent to Ukraine. A U.S. military official declined to comment on the strike.HIMARS, which fires satellite-guided rockets from mobile launchers, is part of a growing arsenal of sophisticated Western weapons that have helped Ukraine change the course of the conflict.Since the Biden administration began supplying the weapons system in June, HIMARS has greatly increased the range and precision of the outgunned Ukrainians. They have been used it to hit targets far behind the front lines, like the main bridge linking the city of Kherson to Russian-held territory, which contributed to the Russian decision to abandon the city.Last month, a Ukrainian HIMARS attack destroyed a hotel in the city of Kadiivka, in the Luhansk region northeast of Donetsk. That attack killed members of Kremlin-aligned Wagner paramilitary group who were using the hotel as a base, according to Ukrainian authorities in the region.The HIMARS system is most effective when used against stationary targets that can be identified in advance and pinpointed, such as ammunition dumps, infrastructure or troop concentrations. The U.S. has so far supplied Ukraine with at least 20 HIMARS systems, which are made by Lockheed Martin.Many soldiers who were casualties appeared to be new recruits, recently mobilized in Putin’s drive to conscript more men into the fighting in Ukraine. One report in Russian state media said that “active use of cellular phones by the newly arrived servicemen” had been a prime reason for the attack, helping Ukrainian forces to pinpoint their location.Throughout the war, Russian soldiers in Ukraine have spoken on open cellphone lines, often revealing their positions and exposing the disarray in their ranks. Although the continued use of the phones, despite the devastating consequences, exposes a failing by the military command, military bloggers say this explanation shifts the blame onto the victims.It does not address why Russian commanders housed so many conscripts in an unprotected building within reach of U.S.-made rockets.“No one is assuming the responsibility for the needless deaths,” one blogger, Anastasia Kashevarova, wrote on Telegram.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.",1.0
Russian Proxy Official Calls Attack in Donetsk a ‘Massive Blow’,Housing; Artillery; New year; Missiles; Ammunition; Humanitarianism; Military personnel,"Enlarge this image.Ukrainian forces used U.S.-supplied guided rockets to hit a building housing Russian soldiers in an occupied eastern city early on New Year’s Day, both sides said, in one of the deadliest strikes on Moscow’s forces in the 10-month-old war.The deaths of at least 60 soldiers, and possibly many more, drew immediate and harsh criticism in Russia from supporters of the war, who said that the military was making repeated and costly mistakes, including housing soldiers in dense numbers within striking distance of Ukrainian weapons.The Russian Defense Ministry said Monday that 63 service members had been killed in the strike in the city, Makiivka, which is in the Donetsk region. Ukraine claimed that “about 400” Russian soldiers had died. Neither figure could be independently verified.A spokesperson for the Russian-installed proxy government in the Donetsk region, Daniil Bezsonov, called the strike “a massive blow” and hinted at errors by Russian commanders. “The enemy inflicted the most serious defeats in this war on us not because of their coolness and talent, but because of our mistakes,” he wrote in a post on the Telegram messaging app.Ukraine hit the building housing the soldiers, which both sides described as a vocational school, using HIMARS, a guided rocket system supplied by the United States. The system’s range of dozens of miles has for months helped Ukraine’s forces strike deep behind the front lines.Kyiv has shifted in recent weeks from using the American-made rocket systems to hit ammunition dumps and supply lines to targeting barracks and other troop concentrations, said Michael Kofman, director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Virginia.The Russian Defense Ministry said that four HIMARS rockets had hit the building, while two others had been shot down by Russian air defenses.Anger over the Russian military’s failure to safeguard the soldiers extended beyond pro-war military bloggers. Even some Russian lawmakers who are usually in lockstep with the Kremlin demanded an investigation.One pro-war lawmaker, Sergei Mironov, a prominent member of the upper house of Russia’s parliament, called on his Telegram channel for criminal prosecution of all officials responsible for the Makiivka disaster “whether they wear epaulets or not.”“Obviously neither intelligence nor counterintelligence or air defense worked properly,” he said.Accounts by pro-war military bloggers — who have become influential opinion-makers in Russia amid the censorship of mainstream media — suggested that the strike in Makiivka had proved so deadly partly because of a litany of errors by Moscow’s forces, some of which have been repeated throughout the war.One military blogger, Igor Girkin, a former Russian paramilitary commander in Ukraine who is also known as Igor Strelkov, said that the vocational school had been “almost completely destroyed” because “ammunition stored in the same building” detonated in the strike. Video posted on social media showed firefighters amid the ruins of the structure and piles of steaming rubble.The ammunition was stored “without the slightest sign of disguise,” Girkin wrote, adding that similar strikes had occurred earlier this year, though with fewer casualties. “Our generals are untrainable in principle,” he said.Many of the soldiers appeared to be new recruits. A report in Russian state media said that “active use of cellular phones by the newly arrived servicemen” had been a prime reason for the attack, helping Ukrainian forces to pinpoint their location.Throughout the war, Russian soldiers in Ukraine have spoken on open cellphone lines, often revealing their positions and exposing the disarray in their ranks.Still, some military bloggers said that this official explanation shifted the blame for Makiivka onto the victims, without explaining why commanders housed so many conscripts in an unprotected building within reach of U.S.-made rockets.“No one is assuming the responsibility for the needless deaths,” one blogger, Anastasia Kashevarova, wrote on her Telegram channel.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has called such strikes ""revenge of the losers.""Viktoria Dubrovina, a retired subway system worker, heard what she described as booms in the sky and then explosions near an auditorium, called Palace of Ukraine, across the street from her apartment building in central Kyiv.""I just don't have words,"" she said. ""It's outrageous. We know how vile they are and everybody knew they were ready to attack on the holiday, in theory. But we hoped something would change. But they did it.""The blast shattered windows, tore a five-story-tall hole in the wall of a hotel and left concrete slabs and broken glass sprawled on a street. Strips of insulation blew about.The Palace of Ukraine, one of the largest concert halls in the country, typically stages children's plays during the day on New Year's Eve, but it was closed this year because of the electricity outages from earlier strikes, Andriy Vydysh, the site's deputy director, said in an interview. The foyer and makeup rooms were damaged.Ihor Suruchanu, a lawyer, came to look at a nearby building at the behest of clients. The structure was standing, he said, but the blast wave had passed through it, shattering windows and tearing even interior doors from their frames.That a civilian neighborhood had been hit, he said, did not dismay him -- it showed Russia in a state of desperation.""When I look at this, I think we will win,"" he said. He said he knew of no military targets or of even electrical infrastructure in the area; a nearby factory that had once made military electronics had closed years earlier.""Of course, they did this specifically on New Year's Eve,"" Mr. Suruchanu said.

Deadly Year in Ukraine Ends With a Big Assault:   [Foreign Desk ],Explosions; Bombings; War; Speeches; New year; Missiles; Military air strikes; Military personnel; Cities,"Explosions hit the capital, Kyiv, and other cities on the final day of a year shaped by Russia's invasion. Flanked by soldiers, Vladimir V. Putin called the invasion a ""sacred duty"" of Russians.KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia rained missiles and exploding drones on Ukraine's capital and other cities on Saturday in a deadly New Year's Eve assault, punctuating President Vladimir V. Putin's stated resolve to prosecute a war he called a ""sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants.""The aerial bombardments killed at least one person and partly destroyed a hotel in the capital, Kyiv, inflicted damage elsewhere and forced Ukraine's war-ravaged electric utilities to pre-emptively shut off power.""There are explosions in Kyiv!"" Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""Stay in shelters!""Describing the New Year's Eve assault as ""inhuman"" and Russia as a ""terrorist state,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine directed his rage at Mr. Putin and his subordinates, declaring in a videotaped reaction that ""those who give orders for such strikes, and those who carry them out, will not receive a pardon. To put it mildly.""Even for residents inured to brazen Russian bombings, the wail of air-raid sirens and the explosive thuds on New Year's Eve and into the first hours of 2023 were especially galling. If Mr. Putin's intent was to demoralize them, the aerial assault only generated more hate. ""We know how vile they are and everybody knew they were ready to attack on the holiday, in theory,"" said Viktoria Dubrovina, a retired Kyiv subway worker who joined others inspecting the damage after sirens stopped. ""But we hoped something would change. But they did it.""In his New Year's address, Mr. Zelensky said that Ukrainians woke up on Feb. 24, the first day of the invasion, ""into another life."" He said that the first Russian missile barrage ""finally destroyed the labyrinth of illusions. We saw who was who. What friends and enemy are capable of, and most importantly, what we are capable of.""He added of the coming year, ""let this year be the year of return"" of soldiers to families, prisoners to homes, and Ukrainian land to Ukraine. ""The temporarily occupied will become forever free,"" he said.The attacks began in midafternoon, only hours before Mr. Zelensky had been scheduled to deliver a much-anticipated speech to a nation where the Russian invasion has shaped the past 10 months and could for many more or far longer.Air defense crews shot down 12 of at least 20 cruise missiles launched by Russia on Saturday afternoon, the top Ukrainian military commander, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said on Telegram. The missiles had been launched from Russian strategic bombers over the Caspian Sea and from land-based launchers, he said.Air raid sirens rang out again after midnight, and several loud explosions were heard in central Kyiv in the ensuing hours, ringing out in an otherwise dark and still city with residents confined in their apartments by the curfew. Ukrainian officials said air defense systems had successfully hit several targets. No injuries were immediately reported.In his own traditional New Year's Eve address, Mr. Putin broke from practice and delivered the speech not at the Kremlin, but flanked by soldiers at an unspecified military base. He struck a defiant tone, repeating claims that his invasion of Ukraine was a defensive struggle for Russia's existence.Mr. Zelensky, whose impassioned nightly speeches have been become a rallying cry for Ukrainian patriotism and defiance of Russa, had warned on Thursday that the Russian military might launch another wave of missile attacks before any year-end commemorations. Moscow fired a large volley this past week, disrupting electrical power in Kyiv and in other cities.What electricity had been available before the strikes was lost on Saturday in Kyiv, in Odesa in the south, and in cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region in central Ukraine, as the authorities switched off power to prevent short-circuits on the grid caused by any strike damage.Within a few minutes of the explosions in Kyiv, reports of damage in several neighborhoods of the capital came out, and a video posted on Telegram showed smoke rising above the city.Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an aide to Mr. Zelensky, said in a post on social media that the city of Khmelnytskyi, in western Ukraine, had been attacked by exploding drones and that two people were wounded. In the Zaporizhzhia region, he said, residential buildings were damaged.Between the larger waves of strikes on Thursday and Saturday, the Russian military had kept up the pressure on Ukraine's energy grid with smaller-scale missile attacks, according to Ukraine's military general staff.Over the past day, Russia fired five missiles and 10 exploding drones, and it carried out 29 airstrikes on civilian infrastructure, the general staff said in a statement on Saturday morning.How long Russia can sustain the barrage has been a pressing question in Ukraine, which has stymied and beat back the Russian military across several fronts since Mr. Putin launched the invasion in February.Ukraine has received increasingly sophisticated defense weaponry from the United States and other NATO nations, striking many of the incoming Russian missiles and drones before they reach their targets.Mr. Putin, who has repeatedly said Ukraine is not a legitimate country, used his year-end speech on Saturday as a platform to assert that ""moral and historical righteousness is on our side.""He defined the war in Ukraine as Russians' ""sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants."" Russian soldiers, he said, were fighting to secure ""peace and security guarantees for Russia,"" while the West was using Ukraine ""to weaken and split up Russia.""And reprising his references to antiwar Russians as traitors, Mr. Putin described the year as one that ""clearly separated courage and heroism from betrayal and cowardice.""Mr. Putin was working to rally Russian citizens who are increasingly feeling the effects of a conflict that has left their country the most economically isolated since the breakup of the Soviet Union three decades ago.Moreover, Russian troops have suffered a series of embarrassing setbacks on the battlefield, and the military's strategy has been increasingly criticized, even by domestic supporters of Russia's invasion.While the Kremlin had initially envisioned a quick conquest of Ukraine in February, sending troops speeding into cities with only a few days' supplies, the invasion has mired Russia in a grueling war and revealed weaknesses in its conventional military abilities. American officials say that more than 100,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured since the invasion in February.""We will do all we can to help the families of our killed comrades,"" Mr. Putin said in his remarks on Saturday. ""I share your pain with all my heart.""In addition to trying to raise spirits on the home front, Mr. Putin's speech also demonstrated his latest attempt to signal to the West that he has no plans to ease his onslaught against Ukraine.His singular focus on the war in his New Year's speech showed that the Kremlin had fully dispensed with its earlier strategy of playing down the war for the broader public, even though officials still refer to the fighting as only a ""special military operation.""New Year's Eve was also a reminder of one of Mr. Putin's biggest miscalculations: Western unity in the face of the invasion.Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, in his own traditional New Year's Eve speech, said that despite ""a difficult year,"" Germany and the rest of Europe had withstood unexpected hardships caused by Mr. Putin's war.Mr. Scholz's first 12 months as chancellor have been among the most tumultuous of Germany's postwar history. It was not what he, nor nearly anyone in Europe, had expected.""Putin is conducting an imperialist war of aggression at the heart of Europe,"" he said in a speech broadcast on Saturday evening. ""This watershed moment is also a tough test for us and our country.""But on the eve of a new year, Mr. Scholz argued that 2022 also reflected strengths to celebrate.""The history of 2022 is not purely one of war, suffering and worry,"" he said. ""After all, Putin did not manage, as he had planned, to overrun Ukraine in a matter of days.""""On the contrary, the Ukrainians are bravely defending their homeland -- thanks in part to our help,"" he said. ""And we will continue to support Ukraine.""Erika Solomon, Rick Gladstone and Matt Surman contributed reporting.Erika Solomon, Rick Gladstone and Matt Surman contributed reporting.The Russian attack on Saturday partly destroyed a hotel in Kyiv, above.

Russian artillery shells kept streaking overhead and thudding into Ukrainian-held territory through the afternoon and evening, just as they had for months, despite a supposed 36-hour cease-fire declared by Russia.There were scattered reports of attacks elsewhere in Ukraine, but the clearest contradiction of the promised lull in the fighting was in Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk Province, the scene of the most intense recent fighting of the war.

They dismissed it as a cynical propaganda ploy by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, as well as a bid to give battered Russian forces a breather. In any case, the Ukrainians said, they did not trust the Russians to stop shooting.Fighting continued on Friday along several parts of the front, which stretches hundreds of miles through southern and eastern Ukraine. Each side accused the other of initiating it, saying that their forces were just defending themselves. It was not immediately possible to verify their claims, or to determine how the intensity of combat compared to previous days.But a cease-fire this was not.Ukrainian officials and military analysts warned that the Kremlin would use any respite to replenish battered units, ferrying fresh troops, weapons and ammunition to the front. In his nightly video address, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Thursday that the government in Moscow ""wants to use Christmas as a cover"" to regroup and thwart Ukrainian advances.""Everyone in the world knows how the Kremlin uses lulls in the war to continue the war with new force,"" he added, and he addressed the Russian people directly, in Russian, speaking of those who ""sent all of your people to be slaughtered"" and ""do not strive for peace.""Since invading Ukraine in February, Russia has endured international condemnation and isolation, and seen its war effort stumble badly. Political analysts said that the Kremlin would try to use the Christmas cease-fire announcement -- which it cast as nothing more than a bid to allow soldiers and others on both sides to celebrate the holiday and attend church services -- for a badly needed public relations boost, both at home and abroad.Sure enough, the Kremlin and its allies on Friday portrayed Russia as the reasonable peacemaker and Ukraine as the aggressor, using the cease-fire announcement to bolster Mr. Putin's claim to be the defender of Orthodox Christianity against a decadent and godless West, though most Ukrainians are also Orthodox Christians.The Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leader publicly called for the cease-fire hours before it was announced, have developed an increasingly close alliance.""Ukrainians were offered a hand of Christian mercy on the great holiday,"" Dmitri A.

Kyiv Claims Steep Russian Toll in Strikes:   [Foreign Desk ],Artillery; New year; Military personnel; Social networks; War,"Kyiv says its forces have killed or wounded more than 1,000 Russian soldiers in a series of pinpoint attacks. Russia has confirmed only one of three waves of strikes.KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine has claimed a string of successful artillery attacks on Russian barracks in the first days of the year, asserting that it hit newly drafted men and other soldiers where they were sleeping or congregating, killing or wounding more than 1,000.The Russian military has confirmed one of the three waves of claimed strikes, though it gave a much lower death toll than the Ukrainians estimate. Even the lower toll of 89 soldiers killed in that attack, however, represents a startling setback for the Russian military.Social media posts, reports from local residents and Russians who blog about military affairs offered partial confirmation of the other strikes claimed by Ukraine, but not corroboration of the casualty counts.Military analysts say the Ukrainians' use of long-range artillery, including American-provided HIMARS precision rockets, to target barracks marks a shift for the artillery forces, which for months had concentrated on matériel like ammunition depots.The Ukrainian military's focus on the Russian infantry is among the first changes seen in its tactics with its American-provided weaponry, in response to Russia's mobilization of hundreds of thousands of soldiers over the fall. The haphazard movement of additional soldiers into the war zone, many of them poorly trained and led, has presented new targets behind the front lines for howitzers that can fire more than 20 miles and HIMARS rockets with a range of up to about 50 miles, analysts say.The Russian authorities say that draftees' use of personal cellphones on New Year's Eve helped the Ukrainians pinpoint a vocational school, being used to house soldiers, that was hit in the city of Makiivka in eastern Ukraine.Ukraine said the attack killed or wounded several hundred soldiers, while the Russians reported 89 dead. The casualty estimates could not be independently confirmed, and militaries often exaggerate the losses of their enemies and downplay their own.

"Ukraine Keeps Shooting Down Russian Drones, but at a Steep Price:   [Foreign Desk ]",Invasions; War; Military policy; Military aircraft; Missiles; Defense; Assaults,"When costly missiles take out cheap drones, the real winner over time may be the country that spends less.Exploding drones are lumbering and noisy and relatively easy to shoot from the sky and, over the New Year's weekend, Ukraine says, its military downed every single one of about 80 that Russia sent the country's way.""Such results have never been achieved before,"" a Ukrainian air force spokesman said on Tuesday.But some military experts wonder if the successes are sustainable.Ukraine is getting more and more skilled at knocking down drones, but there is a growing imbalance: Many of its defensive weapons like surface-to-air missiles cost far more than the drones do. And that, some military experts say, may favor Moscow over the long haul.Artem Starosiek, the head of Molfar, a Ukrainian consultancy that supports the country's war effort, estimated that it costs up to seven times more to down a drone with a missile than it does to launch one. That is an equation that the Kremlin may be banking on, some analysts say.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in an overnight speech, warned that Russia was betting on the ""exhaustion of our people, our air defense, our energy sector.""Ukraine has vowed not to be cowed by the aerial assault, but the attacks have been unrelenting.Molfar said its group estimated that, since September, Russia had launched around 600 drones at Ukraine. The campaign, targeted at infrastructure and accompanied by numerous missile strikes, has knocked out power, heating and water across Ukraine just as the country's harsh winter has started to bite, compounding the misery of a Russian invasion that is nearing its first anniversary.The Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones that Moscow has increasingly been relying on since October are relatively uncomplicated devices and fairly cheap, while the array of weapons used to shoot them out of the sky can be much pricier, according to experts. The self-destructing drones can cost as little as $ 20,000 to produce, while the cost of firing a surface-to-air missile can range from $ 140,000 for a Soviet-era S-300 to $ 500,000 for a missile from an American NASAMS.Since the war began in February, both sides have used drones not just for reconnaissance but also for attacks. It is the first time the devices have been so widely deployed in a European war. Some military experts view Ukraine as a testing ground for state-of-the-art weapons and information systems that may foreshadow the shape of warfare for generations to come.The military authorities in Kyiv have said little about the details of their air defenses -- in keeping with the operational secrecy that has shrouded much of their war planning -- or about the cost, making analysis difficult.But it is known that while Ukraine's forces have enjoyed some success against drones using antiaircraft guns and even small-arms fire, that has changed as the Russians have taken to launching assaults at night. Now Kyiv is also relying heavily on missiles fired from warplanes and the ground. Over the weekend, officials said, Ukraine employed surface-to-air missiles fired from NASAMS -- for National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System -- multiple times to counter drones.Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the CNA research institute, said that Ukrainians were using ""a zoo of different air defense systems"" to combat the threat, including Soviet-era and NATO missile systems, each with its own cost profile.Some of Ukraine's antiaircraft guns, like the Gepard 2 radar-directed mobile gun system, are inexpensive in comparison with other Soviet-era and European defense systems being deployed. But some of the American-made interceptor missiles are fairly expensive compared with drones.Even so, evaluating the wisdom of downing drones with missiles is not always straightforward.George Barros, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, said he suspected that Ukraine was deploying more complex and expensive air defense systems to protect sensitive and critical infrastructure.It costs far less, for example, to shoot down a drone than to repair a destroyed power station, Mr. Starosiek noted. And then there is the human factor.""People are still alive,"" he said.Mathieu Boulegue, a consulting fellow with the Russia and Eurasia Program at Chatham House, a London-based research organization, said that Ukraine currently had enough air defense weapons and ammunition to combat the threat of Russian drones.""The cost is irrelevant as long as the West keeps providing military assistance to Ukraine,"" Mr. Boulegue said. ""The problem for Kyiv is the moment they don't have enough stock of ammunition in their air-defense chain to shoot down these drones.""Aware of the risk that Western allies may grow weary of the cost of supporting Ukraine's defense -- a concern heightened by the transfer of leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives to the Republicans -- Ukrainian officials have warned that Russian tactics are changing.The White House has said that it is aware of reports that the Kremlin and Tehran are seeking to establish a joint production line for drones in Russia. Over the long term, Mr. Boulegue said, that would allow Moscow to deploy still more drones in attacks.""That is going to put more stress on Ukraine's air defense system,"" he said.That helps explain why Ukraine has adapted its own tactics, in part by conducting strikes on bases deep inside Russian territory. The goal, Mr. Boulegue said, is ""to increase deterrence, which they hope will place less stress on air defense.""For now, Moscow has changed how it is using the drones it already has in hand.Russian forces have increasingly been launching their explosive drones at night and low along the Dnipro River, making it harder for Ukraine to detect them, according to Yurii Ihnat, the spokesman for the Ukrainian air force, who was speaking on Ukrainian radio.""The radar antenna that detects the target will not see it if the target is flying below the level of the antenna,"" he said.Andrew E.

"U.S. Troops Train Near Crimea, Sending a Warning to Russia:   [Foreign Desk ]",Invasions; Military policy; Military exercises; War; Military personnel; Armed forces; Military aid; Military training; Military deployment,"The deployment to a NATO country near the conflict in Ukraine is seen as a model of deterrence for a U.S. military that has recently stepped back from direct fighting.MIHAIL KOGALNICEANU AIR BASE, Romania -- The soldiers of the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division train, eat and sleep on a drab, sprawling post in southeast Romania, a mere seven-minute rocket flight from where Russia has stockpiled munitions in Crimea.Farther north, in military exercises with Romanian troops just a few miles from the Ukrainian border, U.S. soldiers, also from the 101st division, are firing artillery, launching helicopter assaults and digging trenches similar to those on the front lines in the region near Kherson, the Ukrainian port city from which Russian troops retreated in November.It is the first time the 101st Airborne Division has been deployed to Europe since World War II, and with their presence in Romania, a member of NATO, its soldiers are now closer to the war in Ukraine than any other U.S. Army unit.Its mission is considered a model for an American miliary that has newly stepped back from two decades of actively fighting wars and into an era of trying to deter adversaries -- using a show of force as well as training, weapons shipments and other aid to drive home the point.""This is a regional conflict, but it has global implications,"" the U.S. Army's chief of staff, Gen. James C. McConville, said in a mid-December interview at the air base, which shares a runway with an adjoining commercial airport named for the former Romanian prime minister, Mihail Kogalniceanu, near the Black Sea.The troop deployment in Romania is meant as a warning to Moscow, part of President Biden's pledge to defend ""every single inch"" of NATO territory without tempting President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into escalating. But holding joint exercises is also a way of ensuring that allies in southeast Europe are ready to hold the line.It is unclear what kind of footprint the United States will keep at the base; the Pentagon will soon decide whether to maintain the number of American troops and senior commanders there.Some in Congress are wary of the cost of meeting Ukraine's continuing demands for support -- with the top House Republican, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, suggesting in October that his party might be unwilling to write a ""blank check"" to Ukraine.But supporters of maintaining a strong presence in Eastern Europe pointed to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February as proof that the United States and its NATO allies did not do enough to deter Moscow last winter.""This is one of the most important lessons that we have to take away from Ukraine,"" Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, told reporters after returning from a brief trip to Ukraine in early December. ""When we look at the other scenario that might unfold like Ukraine, in the Pacific with China and Taiwan, we have to ensure that deterrence is successful.""Military planners echoed that strategy, noting that the 101st Airborne Division was also using the Black Sea for coastal defense training -- a useful skill should China ever become more aggressive and invade Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing has long claimed as its own.The division was ordered to deploy about 4,000 soldiers and senior commanders just weeks after Russia invaded. They arrived at the air base, near the Romanian coastal city of Constanta, over the summer. The base previously served as a sleepy outpost for training NATO troops, including several hundred American soldiers, and was known more broadly in the military as a way station with a small mess hall for U.S. forces heading to and from Afghanistan.The mission here is somewhat different from those elsewhere in Europe, where some U.S. troops are training Ukrainian forces on advanced weapons systems that are being shipped to the Ukrainians. The division's commander, Maj. Gen. J.P. McGee, said that training with other Eastern European soldiers had its own value.""You get a chance to train and operate on the very ground that you might have to defend,"" General McGee said.He added: ""You have to work with a NATO ally, and it's almost unimaginable in the future that we would ever go fight without allies.""In addition to the troops in Romania, General McGee has also sent smaller teams of soldiers to train with NATO allies in Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary and Slovakia. The unit prides itself on being the closest one to the combat, but it is by no means the largest: Officials said that an estimated 12,000 troops attached to the Army's First Infantry Division, added after the invasion, are based mostly in western Poland and the Baltics.Together, they represent a buildup of U.S. forces in Europe since Russia invaded Ukraine, as Mr. Biden promised allies at a NATO summit meeting in Madrid in June.As part of military exercises with American and British forces, Romanian troops have been testing the HIMARS rocket launching systems -- the same weapons that have helped Ukraine push Russian forces into retreat -- against simulated targets in the Black Sea over the past few months. Romania bought three of the rocket systems years ago, and officials said they are still in the process of being delivered.Lt. Gen. Iulian Berdila, chief of the Romanian land forces -- who has welcomed the deployment -- said regional officials had been warning the West of ""incremental and toxic"" advances by Russia since it seized control of Crimea from Ukraine in a 2014 local referendum that much of the world views as illegal.""We've been very attentive to what Russia does, and what are the consequences,"" General Berdila said. Of the training with U.S. troops, he said, ""We've war-gamed together the different scenarios and are prepared to synchronize plans as we speak.""The number and senior command level of American forces currently in Romania are enough, he said, for ""predictable deterrence and defense together.""General McConville would not predict what the Biden administration might do in Romania, but broadly speaking, he said the troops at the air base had ""really made a difference, and I think we will continue to provide those capabilities as required.""Having a division commander and staff so close to the border with Ukraine is more than symbolic, said Becca Wasser, a war analyst at the Center for a New American Security, a research institute in Washington. It allows for quick decisions about where to position thousands of troops and weapons should Russia push the war into NATO territory.""What you are seeing is indicative of a change in how the U.S. military is approaching posture and deployments around the globe as the era of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have changed,"" Ms. Wasser said. ""It's not necessarily going to be this combat deployment -- what you really have is a deterrence deployment.""It is the same kind of mission, Ms. Wasser said, that was undertaken by tens of thousands of American troops sent to bases across the U.S. Central Command in 2020 as tensions with Iran flared across the Middle East.For Command Sgt. Maj. Vitalia Sanders, who leads a battalion at Mihail Kogalniceanu air base, the mission is as personal as it is professional.She was born in a town outside Uzhhorod, in western Ukraine, and moved to northwest Indiana when she was 12 to live with her grandmother. She was last in Ukraine in 2005, and her brother is still there -- although their communications over WhatsApp and Facebook have been limited because Russian strikes have taken out power grids.Sergeant Major Sanders has been in the U.S. Army for 21 years, and served in Afghanistan and Kuwait. But she never forgot the threat that Russia posed to Ukraine.""Just being here, so close to home,"" she said, ""makes me hungry and makes me fight, and hopefully spreads that energy to soldiers to let them know how important this is for everybody.""Photograph Maj.

Ukrainian Strike Exposes Mistakes By Putin's Forces:   [Foreign Desk ],Invasions; Rockets; Casualties; War; Military air strikes,"A Ukrainian attack with U.S.-made rockets may have left hundreds of casualties, and pro-war Russians accused their military commanders of repeating fatal errors.In one of their deadliest attacks yet on Russian forces, Ukrainians used American-made rockets to kill dozens -- and perhaps hundreds -- of Moscow's troops in a New Year's Day strike behind the lines, prompting outraged Russian war hawks to accuse their military of lethal incompetence.The strike by the HIMARS rockets killed 63 Russian soldiers in a building housing them in the occupied city of Makiivka, in eastern Ukraine, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Monday -- an unusual admission for a military that has often refused to acknowledge serious losses. A former Russian paramilitary commander in Ukraine, Igor Girkin, wrote on the Telegram app that ""many hundreds"" were dead and wounded and that many ""remained under the rubble.""Ukrainian military officials said it appeared that ""about 400"" Russian troops had been killed, though they did not explicitly say that Kyiv was behind the attack.None of the claims could be independently verified, but even the lowest number would represent one of the worst Russian losses in a single episode in the war, and an embarrassment for President Vladimir V. Putin. He has vowed repeatedly to correct the glaring errors and weaknesses in his armed forces that the war has exposed, and in a New Year's Eve speech filmed at a military base, Mr. Putin told the families of soldiers killed in the fighting, ""I share your pain with all my heart.""Pro-war Russian bloggers and some government officials said the debacle was caused by the military's own repeated and costly mistakes, like garrisoning troops in a dense concentration within range of Ukrainian artillery, placing them in the same building as an ammunition depot, and allowing them to use cellphones, whose signals the Ukrainians can use to zero in on their target.""Our generals are untrainable in principle,"" wrote Mr. Girkin, who has used the nom de guerre Igor Strelkov.Some pro-war lawmakers demanded an investigation, and one of them, Sergei Mironov, leader of a pro-Kremlin party in the Parliament, called for the prosecution of all officials responsible, ""whether they wear epaulets or not.""""Obviously neither intelligence nor counterintelligence or air defense worked properly,"" he said.The attack was ""a massive blow,"" said a spokesman for the Russian-installed proxy government in the Donetsk region, Daniil Bezsonov. ""The enemy inflicted the most serious defeats in this war on us not because of their coolness and talent, but because of our mistakes,"" he wrote in a Telegram post.More than 10 months after an invasion that Russians -- and many Ukrainians -- thought would produce a quick Russian victory, each side has suffered more than 100,000 killed and wounded, by Western estimates, and the war has become one of attrition, with no evidence of an end in sight.Some of the heaviest recent fighting has ravaged the Donetsk region, one of four the Kremlin claimed to annex in September even as its troops were losing ground there, giving up towns they had seized earlier in the war. Since then combat in the region has slowed to a bloody slog, as the Ukrainians look for places to press their advantage, while Russians build trenches and fortifications along the front lines and try to capture the city of Bakhmut.On Monday, Russia launched a flurry of Iranian-made exploding drones at Ukraine, continuing its barrage against cities and civilian infrastructure, especially the power grid. But it appeared that Ukraine's increasingly effective air defenses once again minimized the damage.The Ukrainian military said on Monday that 22 drones were shot down over Kyiv in the early-morning hours, but at least two loud explosions were heard in the city. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said some energy infrastructure facilities had been damaged, affecting systems that heat buildings. It was not clear if the explosions were caused by drones that evaded air defenses, by drones that were shot down but detonated on hitting the ground, or by air defense missiles.The Ukraine military said it had shot down all 45 Iranian Shahed drones launched over the weekend, though some cruise missiles penetrated its defenses.In his nightly video address, President Volodomyr Zelensky warned on Monday, ""We have information that Russia is planning a prolonged attack with Shaheds,"" aiming to exhaust Ukraine's defenses and its ability to endure. He said, ""Now is the time when everyone involved in the protection of the sky should be especially attentive.""The deadly attack on Russian forces in Makiivka used the HIMARS rocket artillery to hit a vocational school where troops were housed, Moscow said. The Russian Defense Ministry said that four HIMARS rockets had hit the building, and that two others had been shot down by Russian air defenses.As pro-war bloggers and officials reacted with fury, video posted on social media showed firefighters amid the ruins of the structure, reduced to smoking piles of rubble. The bloggers have become influential opinion-makers in Russia amid the censorship of mainstream media.Mr. Girkin, the blogger and former paramilitary commander, wrote that the vocational school in Makiivka had been ""almost completely destroyed"" because ""ammunition stored in the same building"" detonated in the strike. The ammunition was stored ""without the slightest sign of disguise,"" he wrote, adding that similar strikes had occurred earlier this year, albeit with fewer casualties.Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, noted that the Russian officials ""do not typically provide this type of information after a major loss, which suggests they want to control the narrative on this event.""Makiivka, adjacent to the city of Donetsk, lies only about 10 miles from the nearest Ukrainian-held territory, the town of Avdiivka to the northwest -- well within the roughly 50-mile range of the HIMARS rockets the United States has sent to Ukraine. A U.S. military official declined to comment on the strike.HIMARS, which fires satellite-guided rockets from mobile launchers, is part of a growing arsenal of sophisticated Western weapons that have helped Ukraine change the course of the conflict.Since the Biden administration began supplying the weapons system in June, HIMARS has greatly increased the range and precision of the outgunned Ukrainians. They have used it to hit targets far behind the front lines, like the main bridge linking the city of Kherson to Russian-held territory, which contributed to the Russian decision to abandon the city.Last month, a Ukrainian HIMARS attack destroyed a hotel in the city of Kadiivka, in the Luhansk region northeast of Donetsk. That attack killed members of Kremlin-aligned Wagner paramilitary group who were using the hotel as a base, according to Ukrainian authorities in the region.The HIMARS system is most effective when used against stationary targets that can be identified in advance and pinpointed, such as ammunition dumps, infrastructure or troop concentrations. The United States has so far supplied Ukraine with at least 20 HIMARS systems, which are made by Lockheed Martin.Many soldiers who were casualties appeared to be new recruits, recently mobilized in Mr. Putin's drive to conscript more men into the fighting in Ukraine. One report in Russian state media said that ""active use of cellular phones by the newly arrived servicemen"" had been a prime reason for the attack, helping Ukrainian forces to pinpoint their location.Throughout the war, Russian soldiers in Ukraine have spoken on open cellphone lines, often revealing their positions and exposing the disarray in their ranks. Though the continued use of the phones, despite the devastating consequences, exposes a failing by the military command, military bloggers say this explanation shifts the blame onto the victims.It does not address why Russian commanders housed so many conscripts in an unprotected building within reach of U.S.-made rockets.""No one is assuming the responsibility for the needless deaths,"" one blogger, Anastasia Kashevarova, wrote on Telegram.Eric Schmitt and Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting.Eric Schmitt and Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting.Photograph Ukrainians fired a mortar round toward Russian forces in the Donetsk region on Sunday.

"In Wave of Strikes, Russian Missiles Kill 12 Across Ukraine",Invasions; Missiles; Armed forces,"Enlarge this image.KYIV, Ukraine — Russia fired dozens of missiles at Ukrainian cities Thursday, piercing snow clouds and air defenses to kill at least 12 people across the country in the Kremlin’s campaign to punish civilians while its army fights in Ukraine’s east.The wave of strikes came a day after Germany and the United States pledged to send dozens of battle tanks to Ukraine, a significant step up in Western military support. Ukraine managed to shoot down 47 of the 55 missiles, according to its air force command, including 20 in the area around the capital, Kyiv.But a variety of Russian strikes still killed 11 people across 11 regions, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said. Another 11 people were wounded, and 35 buildings were damaged, it said.A 12th civilian was killed later in the day when a Russian rocket hit a village council building in Kochubeivka, a tiny community in the Kherson region, a military official said on Telegram.As it has for months, Russia appeared to target Ukraine’s energy grid in subfreezing winter weather. “The main goal is energy facilities providing Ukrainians with light and heat,” Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in a post on Telegram.Since October, Russia has launched more than a dozen major waves of missiles and drones on Ukraine’s energy facilities, as well as many smaller attacks, in a campaign to impair the power supply and leave civilians without power, heat and light over winter.The barrages have sometimes come after Ukrainian successes, such as its fall campaigns in the northeast and the south, but have continued as the pace of fighting has slowed to a grueling battle of attrition in the east and south.The missile strikes have often landed in residential areas as well, sometimes to devastating effect, as when more than 40 people were killed in a strike on an apartment building in Dnipro, in central Ukraine.Large booms shook Kyiv about 10 a.m. local time Thursday, sending residents fleeing into subway shelters and basements. The mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said one person had been killed and two wounded when a projectile hit a building in the city’s south.At least one blast could be heard on camera, interrupting an interview that a member of Ukraine’s parliament was giving to broadcaster Sky News. “Where was it?” a woman asks in the video, as the lawmaker and journalist stand amid destroyed Russian tanks. “Not far away.”Three people were killed in a Russian strike on infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia, the state prosecutor general’s office said on Telegram. There were also reports of missile strikes in the Vinnytsia region in western Ukraine and outside the port city of Odesa, causing “massive power outages” there, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba.France’s foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, was in Odesa on Thursday to meet with Kuleba — diplomatic talks that were literally forced underground by the Russian strikes.“Thanks to a Russian missile, I experienced my 1st diplomatic bilateral meeting in a shelter,” Colonna tweeted Thursday, sharing a photo of the ministers at a table in a bare room. “Coffee was warm, merci!”Kuleba, who noted that Odesa’s historic center was designated a world heritage site in danger this week by UNESCO, said on Twitter that the meeting was “probably the first time in history when Foreign Ministers hold talks in the basement of an Opera House.”The UN agency’s designation gives the city, which was conquered in the late 18th century by the Russian Empire and given the name Odesa by the empress Catherine the Great, “access to reinforced technical and financial international assistance,” UNESCO said. “Ukraine may request this to ensure the protection of the property and, if necessary, assist in reconstruction if attacked.”Colonna said the ministers had discussed French support for Ukraine, saying, “Our assistance will continue in all areas and for as long as necessary.”Kuleba — who joked that the French minister was “the Catherine I’m pleased to see in Odesa” — has pressed Ukraine’s supporters in Europe and the United States to significantly increase their military aid. Not long after Germany and the United States announced they would send dozens of battle tanks to Ukraine, he called for “Western-type fighter jets.”Ukrainian officials have argued that such warplanes would help them defend against Russia’s missile volleys.For the past week, Russia’s air force has been conducting exercises north of Ukraine in Belarus, keeping Ukraine on heightened alert. Countrywide air attack sirens have sounded each time Russian planes take to the air.Overnight, according to Ukraine’s air force command, Ukraine’s air defenses shot down 24 Iranian-made Shahed exploding drones.Both the United States and Germany have pledged Patriot air-defense missile batteries to Ukraine, and the U.S. military is training Ukrainian troops in Oklahoma on how to use the weapon, which is the most advanced U.S. ground-based air-defense system.The Biden administration has significantly increased its military aid to Ukraine over the past year, gradually expanding the array of arms it has agreed to provide to include HIMARS rocket artillery systems in the summer, Stryker armored fighting vehicles, Patriot missiles and, now, M1 Abrams tanks. Britain has promised to send some of its Challenger 2 tanks, while Germany has agreed to supply some of its Leopard 2 tanks and to allow other countries to give theirs to Ukraine.Military experts and Western officials say they believe that Ukraine and Russia will both attempt offensives in the spring, as Ukraine puts to use the heavy weapons sent from the West and Russia deploys the huge numbers of men it drafted last year.“The spring and summer look like they’re going to be fairly decisive,” said Michael Kofman, director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Virginia. Speaking on the podcast “War on the Rocks” this week, Kofman said that in its next offensive, Ukraine would have “a strong opportunity to show that it can continue retaking territory.”But unlike its past offensives in the Kharkiv region to the northeast and the Kherson region to the south, “the next offensive comes with risk,” he said. “If it’s not successful, Ukraine faces the real danger of a counteroffensive.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.Enlarge this image.",1.0

U.S. Extends Its Troops At War's Edge:   [Foreign Desk ],Invasions; Military personnel; Armed forces,"The buildup is part of President Biden's commitment to increase American forces in Europe in response to the Russian invasion last February.The Pentagon will keep several thousand American troops in southeast Romania for at least nine more months, closer to the war in neighboring Ukraine than any other U.S. Army unit, officials said on Saturday.Over the last year, the sprawling Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base, just a seven-minute rocket flight across the Black Sea from where Russian forces have settled in Crimea, has become a training hub for NATO forces in southeast Europe. The forces would be a first line of defense should Russia invade further west.There are around 4,000 U.S. soldiers with the 101st Airborne Division who have been stationed at the air base since last summer, including small groups of troops that frequently train right on Romania's border with Ukraine. Before that, there was a smaller contingent from the 82nd Airborne that was sent as part of a quick-response force after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February.The 101st Airborne Division troops will leave in the next two months, and officials said they would be replaced by a different brigade from the 101st Division, which is based at Fort Campbell, Ky.Additionally, officials said, the mission will be led by the senior staff, including its two-star general and top planners, from the 10th Mountain Division, based in Ft. Drum, N.Y., for what is expected to be a nine-month deployment.Prior to Saturday, it had not been clear whether the Pentagon would keep the senior-level unit at the air base on Romania or move its forces elsewhere.Sending a two-star general that close to the combat zone, military analysts have said, would allow for quick decisions about where to position troops and weapons should Russia push the war into NATO territory.The move ""would ensure the United States continues to be well positioned to provide a robust deterrent and defensive posture alongside our allies across the European continent,"" the Army said in a statement on Saturday. ""The United States will continue to adjust its posture as needed in response to the dynamic security environment.""The buildup was part of President Biden's commitment in June to increase American forces in Europe in response to Russia's invasion. That also included about 12,000 American troops, currently based in western Poland, to work with NATO forces in Poland and the Baltics.Supporters of maintaining a strong presence in Eastern Europe have pointed to Russia's attack as proof that the United States and its NATO allies did not do enough to deter Moscow last winter.The American forces in Romania are training soldiers from NATO allies in Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary and Slovakia. Though they are among the closest units to the combat, they are not training Ukrainian forces on advanced weapons systems that are being shipped to the Ukrainians.Romanian military officials have welcomed the American troops as a force large enough to ensure what Lt.

"Safe at Home in Dnipro, Until a Russian Missile Struck:   [Foreign Desk ]",War; Military air strikes,"DNIPRO, Ukraine -- A Russian missile as long as a city bus was nearing the end of a roughly 300-mile flight, its 2,000-pound warhead armed to detonate on impact.As it was descending through a gray sky last Saturday, traveling at supersonic speed, Rostyslav Yaroshenko, 12, was watching TikTok videos in his kitchen on the third floor at 118 Victory Embankment, a sprawling apartment complex in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Six floors up, Yevgeniy Botvynov had just curled up with his wife, Olha, under a blanket, trying to keep warm during yet another power outage.On the other side of the building, two couples had gathered in their kitchens on the fourth floor, one of them warming a late lunch, the other doting on their 1-year-old son.It was what passes for an ordinary Saturday for ordinary Ukrainian people these days, in a place far from the front lines of the war with Russia, but never fully at peace. All day, air-raid warnings were sounding, forcing people to make calculations that have become habitual: Go to a shelter or stay home? Take the elevator or the stairs?Most of the time, life appears to be normal. And then, suddenly, it does not.Around 3:40 p.m. on the 325th day of Russia's full-fledged war in Ukraine, an ordinary Saturday turned extraordinary when the Russian Kh-22 missile slammed into 118 Victory Embankment.More than 30 apartments were instantly incinerated, with nothing left but a column of swirling ash. Along the singed periphery, some units were sliced apart with almost surgical precision, exposing the contents of people's living rooms, bathrooms and kitchens to the open air. A bowl of fruit sat unscathed on the table in one kitchen that had been opened up like a dollhouse; in another unit, a painting of a dog hung crookedly on a kitchen wall -- though the kitchen was no longer there.On Thursday, the authorities raised the death toll to 46, including six children; 80 were wounded. It was one of the deadliest single attacks against civilians since the early weeks of the war.The apartment building, an enormous Soviet-era edifice, forms a large inverted J that curls around an internal courtyard, with the largest section facing the Dnipro River. An estimated 1,700 people called it home.The missile hit just above the joint where the building began to curve away from the embankment. For those at the center of the impact, death came instantly: The explosion simply vaporized some residents, according to the authorities.Olha Usova, a 36-year-old dentist, happened to be walking by on her way to a newly opened gym when the missile struck. A single piece of shrapnel pierced her heart, her husband, Eduard, said, killing her instantly. He said he felt that with normal attacks, you had a decent chance of surviving just by remaining indoors. This one was different.""In this case,"" he said, ""such a rocket left no chance for survival.""Many did manage to survive, but that often depended on where in their homes they were at the moment of impact. Many found themselves trapped, the missile's force having sheared off the stairwells on two sides of the building.Mr. Botvynov, who had been cuddling with his wife under a blanket, first had to pull himself free from the twisted remains of a balcony that had crashed through his living room. Then he grabbed his heavily bleeding wife and rushed to the front door. When he opened it, there was nothing but a nine-story drop into the smoking rubble below.Across the void, he saw a woman curled in fetal position, partly buried in debris from her destroyed apartment.""I thought that it was a corpse,"" said Mr. Botvynov, 48. ""And then I see her waving her hand.""It is impossible to say whether the apartment complex in Dnipro was hit intentionally. The Kh-22 is a 1960s-era anti-ship missile launched by Russian bombers that is designed to attack warships at sea, and it may have more limited abilities to accurately attack targets on land.A power station directly across the river from the complex could have been an intended target, part of Russia's strategy of starving Ukrainians of electricity, though it was roughly two miles away. The Kremlin has denied that a Russian missile was involved, blaming an errant Ukrainian air-defense missile. Military experts have dismissed this claim as yet another Russian fabrication, pointing to the colossal damage.The day of the attack was a holiday in Ukraine, when many celebrate what is known as Old New Year, based on the Orthodox Church's pre-modern calendar. That made Olha Afanasieva, 49, anxious. After 11 months of war, Ukrainians believe that the Kremlin takes a twisted pleasure in attacking on holidays.""For me, it was such an anxious day,"" she said, adding that she had insisted that her husband not go fishing as planned. ""I felt like something was about to happen.""Ms. Afanasieva's husband, Oleh Valovyi, took things in stride, though. Rockets had rained down on a number of cities that day, and the entire country was under an alert for hours.""There are not that many bomb shelters,"" Mr. Valovyi said, ""and you get tired of running there because the air-raid alarms sound practically every day, several times a day.""The couple were seated at their kitchen table when the missile hit, she with her left side facing a window, he directly in front of it. The blast blew out the window, and glass and debris shredded half of Ms. Afanasieva's face. But her husband bore the brunt of it.""He was just all black and bloody,"" she said. ""His face started to turn black under the eyes, and all that, my God.""Finding their apartment door jammed, she went to the window screaming and waving a towel and a bathrobe, trying to catch the attention of firefighters who had started assembling below.At the same time, Mr. Botvynov, facing the nine-story drop with no stairs, was frantically signaling with his cellphone's flashlight, worried that his wife, who was bleeding profusely from her head, would lose consciousness.On the fourth floor, Kateryna Zelenska, who is 27 and deaf, was trapped under the rubble, unable to signal emergency workers. Her husband, Oleksii Zelensky, 28, and their 1-year-old son, Mykyta, were somewhere nearby, but she did not know their conditions. Slabs of concrete had collapsed onto their apartment from the floors above. Somehow, Ms. Zelenska managed to make a brief call to her mother, apparently to say goodbye.""She said, 'Mom, I love you, I love you,' and that's it, it broke off,"" her mother, Oksana Kulak, said through tears.Over the next 24 hours, rescuers using cranes and ladders saved dozens of people trapped on upper floors. It took about three hours to reach Mr. Botvynov and his wife. Ms. Afanasieva got out first, but said she regretted leaving her husband to manage by himself. He passed out on the balcony as firefighters were trying to guide him onto a platform atop a ladder.Later at the hospital, he was in surprisingly good spirits for someone whose body had been pierced by glass head to toe. But he expressed confusion over Russia's choice of target.""I work at a company that deals with agriculture, selling parts for the tractors, a completely peaceful profession,"" he said. ""Surely, my death would not have any military significance.""How rescuers noticed Ms. Zelenska, the deaf woman, is unclear, but by Sunday morning, firefighters attached to safety lines and standing on a platform suspended by a crane were working furiously at the spot where her apartment had been. They cut away debris for hours. Finally, she appeared covered in dust, alive but visibly distressed.For the next 48 hours, firefighters continued to hack at the concrete slabs that had pancaked onto Ms. Zelenska's apartment, searching for her husband and son.By Tuesday morning, the couple's families had gathered at the site in what was a mostly silent vigil, until, as the sun came up, Ms. Zelenska's father, Mykola Kulak, vented his anger.""The Russians, let them all perish, these devils,"" he screamed, holding up his phone to show a video of his grandson. ""This child is still lying under the rubble! I am cursing them, and I wish that every Russian family has two or three, just like this, lying there like our child.""Shortly afterward, rescuers brought down the bodies -- first Mykyta, then Oleksii -- using a special crane. They were placed on the ground in black body bags as their family waited to carry out the wrenching task of identifying them.Oleksii's parents knelt in front of their son's body, unzipped the bag and for several interminable minutes caressed him, sobbing.Ms. Zelenska's parents had rushed off earlier to join their daughter, who had been hospitalized since being rescued two days earlier. She had found out on the internet that the bodies of her husband and son had been recovered, the first confirmation she had that they were dead.On Tuesday afternoon, the authorities declared an end to the search, but by evening, firefighters had returned to 118 Victory Embankment for an unexpected rescue mission. One that came at the behest of Rostyslav, the boy who had been watching TikTok videos before the missile hit.He had managed to escape his mangled apartment by climbing out a window and scrambling down the building's facade with the help of bystanders. But in the confusion, he had been unable to locate his white cat, Belyash.""I was more frightened for my cat,"" he said.And so firefighters once again climbed into the building as Rostyslav, his mother, Nadiia, and a small crowd of onlookers gathered in the darkness below. After about 20 minutes, a firefighter emerged from the kitchen window, a red and white cat carrier in hand. Inside, was a dirty and frightened Belyash.""We're going home,"" said Rostyslav, peering into the carrier when at last he and his pet were reunited.

South Africa to Hold Naval Drill With Russia Despite Ukraine War:   [Correction ],Diplomatic & consular services; Military exercises; Alliances,"The move was criticized by the U.S., which has been trying to rally other countries to isolate Russia over the war in Ukraine.JOHANNESBURG -- South Africa's military said on Thursday that it planned to hold joint training exercises off its coast next month with Russia and China, a move criticized by the United States, which has been trying to rally other countries to isolate Russia over the war in Ukraine.The exercises will coincide with the first anniversary of the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb 24. South Africa was among three dozen countries that abstained last year in a vote at the United Nations General Assembly to condemn Russia for its claim to have annexed several regions of Ukraine.South Africa has conducted military exercises with Russia and China before, as well as with the United States and NATO countries. The South African National Defense Force said that the upcoming drills, to be held from Feb. 17-27 near the coastal towns of Durban and Richards Bay, were a ""means to strengthen the already flourishing relations between South Africa, Russia and China.""The United States, which has fostered a decades-long strategic partnership with South Africa, immediately expressed disapproval. David Feldmann, a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, said in a statement, ""We note with concern"" the plan by South Africa to move ahead with the joint exercises ""even as Moscow continues its brutal and unlawful invasion of Ukraine.""He added, ""We encourage South Africa to cooperate militarily with fellow democracies that share our mutual commitment to human rights and the rule of law.""The naval drill is a show of diplomatic independence for South Africa, analysts said. South Africa is part of an alliance with Brazil, Russia, India and China -- known by the acronym BRICS -- and this naval exercise reasserts South Africa's position that it will not allow the conflict between Russia and Ukraine to dictate its diplomatic relations.""It is seen as a war that is happening in Europe, and as far as South Africa is concerned, it's not part of this war,"" said Denys Reva, a maritime researcher with the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa.Photograph A sanctioned Russian container ship, center left, docked in South Africa's naval port outside Cape Town, last month.

Russian Forces Press Toward Bakhmut:   [Live Blog Post ],Aircraft,"Russian forces were shelling villages close to the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities said on Wednesday, as Moscow pressed ahead with its campaign to encircle and capture the nearby city of Bakhmut, the site of some of the fiercest recent battles in the war.Questions have swirled about the fate of Soledar, a small salt-mining town that Russia claims to have captured even as Ukraine has said in recent days that it was still holding on there. But there is growing evidence that the Ukrainian forces have withdrawn under pressure, analysts said, leaving Russia's forces in control of a town that is one of a ring around Bakhmut, a city that Moscow sees as key to its goal of taking the whole eastern area known as Donbas.The town's fall would be a small but concrete advance for Russian forces, which have been dealt setbacks in recent months, losing territory in the fall to Ukrainian counteroffensives in the northeastern region of Kharkiv and the southern region of Kherson.Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the military administration in the Donetsk region, where Soledar and Bakhmut are, said that Russian forces had shelled a handful of villages overnight to the north and west of Soledar. There was no immediate information on casualties in the attacks, he said in a post on the Telegram messaging app, describing the situation in Soledar as ""tense.""Over the weekend, the founder of the Wagner private mercenary group that has been at the forefront of Russia's forces in the area issued a video that appeared to show two Wagner soldiers walking at ease through Soledar, suggesting that they were in control. It was not possible to confirm the authenticity of the video, which followed a statement by Russia's Defense Ministry on Friday that it had seized the city.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Monday that the battle for the city and for the whole of Luhansk and Donetsk, the two regions that make up Donbas, was continuing ""without any respite, without any stop.""On Wednesday, however, a British military intelligence report said that by the end of Monday ""Ukrainian forces had highly likely withdrawn"" from Soledar, ""leaving Russian military and Wagner group proxy forces in control.""In essence, Moscow holds the territory east of Bakhmut running to the Russian border, while Ukraine largely holds the land to the west.""Ukrainian forces have likely established new defensive lines to the west,"" the intelligence report said. It did not cite a source, though the information about new Ukrainian defensive lines appeared to be consistent with Mr. Kyrylenko's report of increased fighting west of Soledar. The town had a population of about 10,000 before the war but now is largely deserted.Bakhmut is a road hub, and Russia's recent gains threaten two of the routes running north through which Ukrainian forces have brought in reinforcements and munitions for the defense of the city, Britain's Defense Ministry said.Ukrainian anti-aircraft gunners had shot down two Russian fighter aircraft near Soledar in the previous 24 hours, the general staff said on Wednesday, as well as hitting two command posts and an ammunition dump.A Ukrainian soldier on the front line near the town of Soledar in Donetsk region, where Russian forces were shelling villages.

"15 Are Killed at Border in Egypt, Officials Say:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"CAIRO -- At least 15 Sudanese migrants trying to cross from Egypt into Israel were shot and killed at the border early Sunday, possibly by Egyptian police officers, according to security officials and news reports.The death toll, if confirmed, would be one of the highest in years for migrants and asylum seekers making the treacherous journey across the Sinai Peninsula into Israel. People coming from Sudan, Eritrea and other countries in East Africa have been tortured by traffickers, beaten or shot by the Egyptian security services and have faced open-ended detention by the Israeli authorities, according to human rights groups.The circumstances of Sunday's shooting were unclear, and Egyptian government officials refused to comment on the deaths. A senior security official in northern Sinai, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, said that the Egyptian border police had shot the migrants when they ignored warnings not to cross the border fence. Fifteen were killed and at least eight others wounded, the official said, adding that another eight migrants had been arrested.But another Egyptian security official said that the Sudanese migrants had been caught in the middle of a shootout between Bedouin smugglers and the Egyptian police, and that they had been killed in the crossfire. And Reuters, citing security sources, said the police had found the migrants' bodies near the border.It was impossible to reconcile the conflicting accounts. Egypt's government, which has been battling an insurgency in northern Sinai for several years, severely restricts access for the news media to towns in the area, as well as to the border zone.Human rights groups have been warning of the perils facing migrants in Sinai for the last decade. A 2008 report by Human Rights Watch said that the Egyptian police had killed at least 33 migrants trying to cross into Israel over a 17-month period. Despite the danger on the Egyptian side, Israeli officials routinely returned the migrants, putting them into Egyptian custody, the report said.Even before the migrants reach the frontier, they have faced torture, sexual assault and other abuse by traffickers demanding money -- essentially ransom -- from the migrants' families in their home countries, human rights groups say.The flow of migrants has slowed over the last three years as northern Sinai has been transformed into a military zone, and as Israel has completed a huge steel fence, topped with barbed wire, along the border. But many still brave the risks. This month, Egyptian security forces shot at a group of asylum seekers, mostly from Sudan, near the border, killing one person and wounding five others, according to a report in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.",1.0
Strategy Shift for ISIS: Inflicting Terror in Distant Lands:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Defying Western efforts to confront the Islamic State on the battlefield, the group has evolved in its reach and organizational ability, with increasingly dangerous hubs outside Iraq and Syria and strategies that call for using spectacular acts of violence against civilians.But even as the militant attacks were playing out across Paris on Friday night, the United States carried out an airstrike -- planned days in advance -- against the leader of the Islamic State in Libya, which has emerged as a pivotal stronghold for the group in North Africa. American and British Special Operations forces have for months been conducting secret surveillance missions in Libya to monitor the rise of fighters aligned with the Islamic State.The massacre in Paris on Friday, following bombings in Beirut, Lebanon, and the downing of a Russian passenger jet over Egypt, all claimed by the Islamic State, reveals a terrorist organization that has changed in significant ways from the West's initial understanding of it as a group focused on holding territory in Syria and Iraq and building a caliphate, or Islamic state.And actions by the United States and its allies -- including a Western bombing campaign of Islamic State-held fighting positions and oil facilities, coordinated with a ground offensive by Kurdish forces to cut off a major supply line -- foreshadow how the West might respond to the growing menace in the coming weeks.The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh, has for the first time engaged in what appears to be a centrally planned campaign of terrorist attacks aimed at inflicting huge civilian casualties on distant territory, forcing many counterterrorism officials in the United States and in Europe to recalibrate their assessment of the group.""They have crossed some kind of Rubicon,"" said William McCants, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and author of ""The ISIS Apocalypse."" ""They have definitely shifted in their thinking about targeting their enemies.""When the Islamic State's Egyptian arm claimed responsibility for blowing up a Russian charter plane over Sinai two weeks ago, some analysts wondered if the group's so-called Sinai Province of the Islamic State had acted on its own and leapt out in front, even at the cost of risking a Russian military backlash on the parent group in Syria and Iraq.But the attacks last week in Paris and Beirut, which the Islamic State also said it carried out, appear to have settled that question and convinced even skeptics that the central leadership was calling the shots.""There is a radical change of perception by the terrorists that they can now act in Paris just as they act in Syria or Baghdad,"" said Mathieu Guidère, a terrorism specialist at the University of Toulouse. ""With this action, a psychological barrier has been broken.""Indeed, at a time when many Western officials were most concerned about Islamic State-inspired, lone-wolf attacks -- terrifying in their randomness but relatively low in casualties -- the attacks in Paris have revived the specter of coordinated, high-casualty attacks planned with the involvement of a relatively large number of perpetrators.American and European authorities said the Paris assault bore the hallmarks of complex attacks conducted by Al Qaeda, or of the Mumbai plot in 2008, when 10 Islamic militants carried out a series of 12 shootings and bombings in the Indian city, lasting four days and killing 164 people.""Their goal is an unconventional urban guerrilla war,"" said Franck Chaix, an officer of the Gendarmerie, France's semi-military police force, and a former head of its special intervention force, G.I.G.N.Al Qaeda, the Islamic State's principal forebear, built its identity around spectacular terrorist attacks because its leaders saw themselves as insurgents seeking to overturn Arab governments that they deemed apostates. Al Qaeda wanted to bait the West into military actions that would destabilize Arab states. The Islamic State, in contrast, has increasingly styled itself a state and, in many ways, behaved like one.The ideology and motivation behind the change may be opaque for years. Analysts suggest that the messianic and apocalyptic side of its jihadist ideology may have gotten the better of the pragmatic impulse that had previously appeared to guide the group's expansion. Or, experts say, the Islamic State may be seeking to use large terrorist attacks the way a more conventional power might use an air force as a tool of its defense policy, to retaliate against enemy attacks and seek to deter them.But, if so, its tactics may be shortsighted, causing redoubled Western attempts to crush the militant organization -- even as the spreading Islamic State structure makes those efforts more challenging.The attacks come against a backdrop of signs that the Islamic State's leaders based in Raqqa, Syria, may have been building closer cooperation with its two most significant affiliates, or ""provinces,"" in Libya and Egypt.The main Libyan arm of the Islamic State -- known as the Tripoli Province and centered in the midcoastal city of Sirte -- has long demonstrated the closest coordination with the group's Syrian hub. The two operations began advertising their cooperation as early as February with a video of Islamic State fighters beheading at least a dozen Egyptian Christians.Western intelligence agencies say Islamic State fighters with experience in Syria and Iraq have often turned up in Darnah, a militant stronghold east of Sirte, although the group's affiliate there was routed earlier this year in a dispute with militant rivals.The United States broadened its fight against the Islamic State in Libya on Friday night, targeting the group's senior leader there, the Pentagon said on Saturday. The airstrike took place in Darnah shortly after the attacks in Paris began, but had been in the works for several days and was not related to the events in France, American officials said.The strike was aimed at Abu Nabil, also known as Wissam Najm Abd Zayd al Zubaydi. He is an Iraqi national who led Qaeda operations in western Iraq from 2004 until 2010. He later moved to eastern Libya to lead Islamic State operations there, the officials said.Pentagon officials said they believed the strike, first reported by The Daily Beast, had killed Abu Nabil, though it would take a few days to confirm. It marked the first time the United States has targeted a senior Islamic State operative outside Iraq or Syria.Libyan news media reported last week that a senior Islamic State leader had personally visited Sirte, stirring speculation about the main group's plans for its local branch. The leader, known as Abu Ali al-Anbari, arrived ""by the sea,"" the Libyan news network 218TV reported, according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence Group.Mr. Anbari's arrival may represent what a senior Pentagon official said were signs that Libya could provide a redoubt for the Islamic State even if the group was driven completely out of Syria and Iraq.With no functioning government, Libya provides a variety of havens and hiding places for Islamic State militants, so airstrikes or other military action on Sirte would merely push them elsewhere. And unlike Syria and Iraq, Libya is a failed state surrounded by weak ones.The timing of the explosion aboard the Russian charter jet with the Islamic State attacks in Beirut and Paris is the most visible indication yet that the Sinai Province group may be taking directions from the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. If the attacks in all three countries were coordinated, some central planners must have been involved.The plane crash was also at least the second time that the Sinai Province has cited retribution for the Western campaign against the faraway Islamic State -- and not domestic Egyptian governance -- as a motive for its acts. It cited the same reasoning this August when it released a video in the Islamic State's trademark style showing the beheading of a Croatian working for a French energy company.",1.0
"Victory Bolsters Kurds, but Not U.S.-Iraq Ties:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"ISTANBUL -- It was a full two months after Islamic State militants stormed through Iraq, massacring captured troops and driving to within a few miles of Baghdad that the United States began taking direct military action in the country.The Obama administration only intervened with airstrikes after the militants were threatening the Kurdish capital, Erbil, and waging atrocities against the Yazidi minority in Sinjar, near the boundaries of Iraqi Kurdistan. That fact was immediately seized on by Iraqi politicians, who accused the United States of being more concerned about protecting the Kurds than Iraq's Arab majority.Now, with Kurdish forces backed by American air power driving jihadist fighters out of Sinjar on Friday, the United States-led coalition appears to have a new and important victory against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.But it may come with a cost: the further undermining of the Iraqi government's authority, and intensified concern about the Kurds' desire for independence. Political figures in Baghdad are again sounding alarmed, both about the United States' reliability as an ally and about the unity of country.The Kurdish capture of Sinjar, with no Iraqi military forces in sight, offers the Kurdistan Regional Government a chance to claim control over a city that before the Islamic State invasion was nominally under the control of Baghdad.The president of the Kurdish government, Massoud Barzani, made that intention clear, holding a news conference on Mount Sinjar in which he pointedly referred to Sinjar as being a part of Kurdistan -- and pointedly ignored the role that rival Kurdish groups played in retaking the city.The result is likely to further embolden the Kurdish government as its pushes toward its goal of statehood, something the United States has opposed, while further alienating an Iraqi government that has become closer to both Iran and Russia. Russia in particular has been more active in the region, expanding its military role in the Syrian war next door and establishing a joint intelligence command center in Baghdad with the Iraqi, Iranian and Syrian governments, over the objections of American officials.As if to drive home their complaint with the United States, a delegation of Iraqi lawmakers visited Moscow on Friday to talk about more Russian military involvement in Iraq -- a development that would further challenge both American influence in Iraq and the Obama administration's long-term strategy to defeat the Islamic State.Ayham Kamel, the director for the Middle East and North Africa at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy firm, said, ""The Sinjar operation will remind the key decision makers in Baghdad that the U.S. has a broader sense of strategic cooperation with the Kurds than with Baghdad.""""The quick gains here against ISIS,"" Mr. Kamel added, ""are going to undermine the broader picture of the unity of Iraq.""The liberation of Sinjar allowed the Kurds to again expand the borders of their region at the expense of the central government. The biggest prize came last year when Kurdish forces took control of Kirkuk and its vast oil fields, territory long disputed by Arabs and Kurds that experts worry could spark a new, ethnic conflict if the Islamic State is defeated and the Iraqi Army is revitalized.Even as the Kurds celebrated victory in Sinjar, the tense relations between them and the central government erupted into violence in the disputed city of Tuz Khurmato, near Kirkuk, as Shiite militias loyal to Baghdad battled Kurdish pesh merga forces. Several people were killed, according to officials, and a hospital, a government office and dozens of homes were set on fire.There are also longstanding tensions between Baghdad and Erbil over how to share Iraq's oil revenue, an issue that became more urgent as oil prices declined and both governments faced budget crises.When the Obama administration decided last year to begin military operations against the Islamic State, first in Iraq and then in Syria, its strategy seemed simple: combining American air power with local ground forces to defeat the militant group.The Americans found that Kurdish militias in Iraq and Syria were their most reliable proxies on the ground -- as opposed to Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq that have eclipsed the struggling Iraqi security forces.In Syria, a growing relationship with Kurdish militia fighters helped lead to a military success against the Islamic State in the northern town of Kobani. Now, Kurdish forces have succeeded in Sinjar with the help of heavy American airstrikes and Special Forces advisers on the ground.But the fact is that Kurds have been willing to fight only to protect and expand territory they see as rightfully theirs, and are unlikely to play an important role in wresting the Islamic State from Sunni Arab strongholds in places like Mosul or Anbar Province in Iraq, or in Raqqa, the group's capital in Syria.Speaking about the Kurdish victory in Sinjar, Maria Fantappie, the senior Iraq analyst for the International Crisis Group, said, ""The cost of it is the fact that you don't necessarily have the means to restrain the political ambitions of this ally.""The close relationship between the United States and the Kurds in both Iraq and Syria has also complicated relationships with two of America's most important regional allies: the Iraqi and Turkish governments.""I think Sinjar adds momentum not just to the U.S. campaign against ISIS, but also U.S.-Kurdish cooperation, which builds on U.S. support for Kurdish forces in Syria,"" Ranj Alaaldin, an expert on Kurdish affairs and a doctoral researcher at the London School of Economics, wrote in an email. ""That will no doubt alarm Baghdad, Turkey, as well as the Iranians and Russians, both of which are competing with the U.S. to bring the Kurds within their orbit of influence.""In Syria, the United States has allied with the Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K., which has long been at war with the Turkish state. And the P.K.K., which is listed as a terrorist group by the United States, Turkey and other governments, was deeply involved in the battle for Sinjar this week.Dhiaa al-Asadi, an Iraqi Shiite lawmaker, said Friday that the American-Kurdish alliance in Sinjar provides ""more proof to the Iraqi government to not rely on the United States.""""The real support given to the Kurds and the fast victories against ISIS,"" he added, ""will give another pretext to look at alternatives and establish coalitions with other countries.""For some Iraqi politicians, closer ties with Russia offer an increasingly attractive alternative -- or at least an important insurance policy.""One of the possible fallouts from this operation is that Baghdad may look more closely to Russia,"" said Ahmed Ali, an Iraq analyst and senior fellow at the Institute of Regional and International Studies at the American University of Iraq.Iran, a longstanding ally of the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government whose role has complicated the United States' efforts to influence events in the region, has welcomed a deeper Russian role in Iraq. And the Kremlin appears to be open to it.After the delegation of Iraqi lawmakers met with Russian officials in Moscow on Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying, ""The Iraqi representatives emphasized their readiness to further strengthening cooperation between Moscow and Baghdad on counterterrorism matters, and they noted the possibility for Russia to continue its security assistance to the Iraqi government.""",1.0
"'Jihadi John' Likely Killed in Airstrike on ISIS Stronghold, Pentagon Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"The Pentagon said on Friday that it was ""reasonably certain"" that an American airstrike had killed Mohammed Emwazi, the Islamic State's most notorious executioner.Col. Steve Warren, a spokesman for the American-led coalition fighting the militant group, told reporters at a news briefing that the airstrike on Thursday took place near the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, Syria. He said the Pentagon was still seeking final verification that Mr. Emwazi, 27, who became known as Jihadi John, was killed in the strike.Speaking from Baghdad over a webcast, Colonel Warren said a Reaper drone fired Hellfire missiles at a car in which Mr. Emwazi and another militant were believed to be traveling. ""We know for a fact that the weapon system hit its intended target, and that the personnel who were on the receiving end of that weapons system were in fact killed,"" he said, but it remained necessary to confirm that ""those personnel were specifically who we thought they were.""Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain defended the decision to target Mr. Emwazi, a naturalized British citizen born in Kuwait, as ""an act of self-defense"" and ""the right thing to do.""""We have been working with the United States literally around the clock to track him down,"" Mr. Cameron said in London. ""This was a combined effort, and the contribution of both our countries was essential. Emwazi is a barbaric murderer.""He called the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, an ""evil terrorist death cult,"" and said of Mr. Emwazi, ""He was ISIL's lead executioner, and let us never forget that he killed many, many Muslims, too.""At a news conference in Tunis, Secretary of State John Kerry said that the airstrike should serve as a warning.""We are still assessing the results of this strike, but the terrorists associated with Daesh need to know this: Your days are numbered, and you will be defeated,"" Mr. Kerry said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. ""There is no future, no path forward for Daesh, which does not lead ultimately to its elimination, to its destruction.""Civil liberties advocates have criticized any official British attempt to kill Mr. Emwazi as possibly unlawful, in a debate that paralleled the criticism over the Obama administration's decision to target and kill Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric and a United States citizen, in Yemen in 2011.The United States considers such strikes against specific militant leaders to be lawful acts of war or self-defense, especially when it is not feasible to attempt to capture the militants but they can be struck by a missile fired from a drone or warplane.In 2014, when the United States began its air campaign against the Islamic State, the Obama administration declared the operations to be part of the existing armed conflict that Congress authorized against Al Qaeda after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The group now known as the Islamic State was a component or affiliate of Al Qaeda for years, but it split away over internal disagreements.Mr. Emwazi, who was first known only as an unidentified, masked man with a British accent, first came to prominence in August 2014, when the Islamic State released a video in which the journalist James Foley was shown reading a statement criticizing President Obama and the American military operation against the Islamic State in Iraq. His captor then beheaded him off camera and then threatened to behead another journalist, Steven J. Sotloff, if his demands were not met.Two weeks later, the Islamic State released a video showing the masked man beheading Mr. Sotloff.The Washington Post revealed Mr. Emwazi's identity in February, reporting that he grew up in a well-off family that moved to Britain when he was a child, and that he had studied computer science at the University of Westminster. The revelation touched off intense examination of the causes of radicalization among Muslim immigrants in Europe.Mr. Emwazi was part of a group of friends, called the ""North London Boys"" by some intelligence analysts, who prayed at the same mosque and became captivated by an Egyptian-born cleric, Hani al-Sibai. Mr. Sibai is thought to have close links to the Tunisian branch of Ansar al-Shariah, a Salafist group that has been linked to a deadly attack in June on tourists in Tunisia.The leader of this network was Bilal al-Berjawi, who was stripped of his British citizenship in 2011 after he went to Somalia to join the Islamist group known as the Shabab, and was killed by an American drone strike the next year. That same year, Mohamed Sakr, another friend, was also killed by a drone strike in Somalia.British officials have said that Mr. Emwazi was on a list of potential terror suspects since 2009, but that they were unable to prevent him from traveling to Syria in 2013.Mr. Foley's parents, John and Diane Foley, said they were not comforted by the news of the attack. ""If only so much effort had been given to rescuing Jim and the other hostages who were subsequently murdered by ISIS, they might be alive today,"" they said in a statement.Reg Henning, the brother of the British aid worker Alan Henning, one of Mr. Emwazi's victims, told the BBC, ""I was glad to hear he had been killed, but I would have preferred him to have been brought to justice."" A trial, he added, might have ""dragged on for months and months.""Bethany Haines, the daughter of another victim, David Cawthorne Haines, said she felt ""an instant sense of relief"" in learning about the attack, because it meant ""he wouldn't appear in anymore horrific videos.""Mr. Emwazi's other victims were Kenji Goto, a journalist, and Haruna Yukawa, an adventurer, both Japanese, and an American aid worker, Peter Kassig, also known as Abdul-Rahman Kassig.Mr. Cameron praised the American decision to target Mr. Emwazi, saying: ""The United Kingdom has no better friend or ally.""He added, ""If this strike was successful -- and we still await confirmation of that -- it will be a strike at the heart of ISIL, and it will demonstrate to those who would do Britain, our people and our allies harm we have a long reach, we have unwavering determination and we never forget about our citizens.""The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said that Mr. Emwazi should ideally have faced trial. ""It appears Mohammed Emwazi has been held to account for his callous and brutal crimes,"" Mr. Corbyn said in a statement on Friday. ""However, it would have been far better for us all if he had been held to account in a court of law. These events only underline the necessity of accelerating international efforts, under the auspices of the U.N., to bring an end to the Syrian conflict as part of a comprehensive regional settlement.""In August, a British drone strike, its first inside Syria, killed three people suspected of being members of the Islamic State, including two British citizens, Reyaad Khan and Ruhul Amin.Britain is not formally taking part in military action in Syria -- its Parliament having rejected such an intervention two years ago -- but Britain and France are involved in the American-led air campaign against Islamic State targets.In 2009, after returning from a trip to Africa, Mr. Emwazi contacted Cage, a British advocacy organization, to complain that he had been harassed by British security services.In a statement on Friday, Cage said that Mr. Emwazi ""should have been tried as a war criminal"" and expressed concern about the attack aimed at him. ""State-sponsored targeted assassinations undercut the judicial processes that provide the lessons by which spirals of violence can be stopped,"" it said.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

U.S. Steps Up Its Attacks on ISIS-Controlled Oil Fields in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ERBIL, Iraq -- The United States and its allies have sharply increased their airstrikes against the sprawling oil fields that the Islamic State controls in eastern Syria in an effort to disrupt one of the terrorist group's main sources of revenue, American officials said this week.For months, the United States has been frustrated by the Islamic State's ability to keep producing and exporting oil -- what Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter recently called ""a critical pillar of the financial infrastructure"" of the group -- which generates about $40 million a month, or nearly $500 million a year, according to Treasury Department estimates.While the American-led air campaign has conducted periodic airstrikes against oil refineries and other production facilities in eastern Syria that the group controls, the organization's engineers have been able to quickly repair damage, and keep the oil flowing, American officials said. The Obama administration has also balked at attacking the Islamic State's fleet of tanker trucks -- its main distribution network -- fearing civilian casualties.But now the administration has decided to increase the attacks and focus on inflicting damage that takes longer to fix or requires specially ordered parts, American officials said.The first evidence of the new strategy came on Oct. 21, when B-1 bombers and other allied warplanes hit 26 targets in the Omar oil field, one of the two largest oil-production sites in all of Syria. American military analysts estimate the Omar field generates $1.7 million to $5.1 million per month for the Islamic State. French warplanes struck another oil field nearby earlier this week.The goal of the operation over the next several weeks is to cripple eight major oil fields, about two-thirds of the refineries and other oil-production sites controlled by the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL.""We intend to shut it all down,"" Col. Steven H. Warren, a military spokesman in Baghdad, said in an email on Thursday.More broadly, the intensified targeting of one of the militant group's major financing sources is part of the Obama administration's effort to accelerate the pace of the anti-Islamic State campaign. The campaign against the militant group also includes helping Kurdish fighters retake the Iraqi border town of Sinjar, and sending some 50 Special Operations troops to assist opposition fighters in eastern Syria as well as the air campaign.Lt. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the head of that campaign, headquartered in Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, said in an interview last week that allied warplanes are intensifying attacks on a series of fixed sites such as oil-production facilities, bomb-making factories and other so-called critical nodes that support the Islamic State's war effort.The revamped plan for attacking the oil-production sites comes after weeks of intense study of eight major fields -- Omar, Tanak, El Isbah, Sijan, Jafra, Azraq, Barghooth and Abu Hardan -- to determine how to inflict more financial pain on the Islamic State, American officials said.Instead of putting the group's oil-production capability out of action for days, the new goal is to knock out specific installations for six months to a year, the officials said. This involves targeting fuel oil separators and elements of pumping stations at sites in Islamic State-controlled areas of Deir el-Zour, a city on the Euphrates River near the eastern border with Iraq.At the same time, the United States shifted some of its surveillance and reconnaissance planes from bases in the Persian Gulf to Incirlik air base in Turkey, a much shorter flight to Syria to allow planes to spend more time lingering over their targets.The new operation is called Tidal Wave II, named after Operation Tidal Wave, the World War II campaign to hit Romania's oil industry and thus hurt Nazi Germany. Lt. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who in September became the commander of the international coalition's effort in Iraq and Syria, came up with the name.Much of the initial targeting was done in South Carolina at Shaw Air Force Base, which has become a leading symbol of the military's ability to carry out global operations from afar.One of the main objectives for the scores of analysts and planners at the air base has been to attack its ability to produce and sell oil.In the air campaign's first three months, for instance, allied warplanes damaged or destroyed more than two dozen smaller mobile refineries and about twice as many collection points where drivers dump their crude oil to be hauled to refineries.Now that targeting is being intensified. ""The art we had of building target sets and doing deep studies on adversaries, in some cases was a lost art,"" General Brown said. ""What targets are we not striking that we could go strike? How do we bring all the intelligence together?""On the Oct. 21 mission, American aircraft struck Islamic State-controlled oil refineries, command and control centers, and transportation infrastructure in the Omar oil field, which produced about 30,000 barrels a day when it was fully functioning. More recently, the field produced about a third of that or less, analysts said.""It was very specific targets that would result in long-term incapacitation of their ability to sell oil, to get it out of the ground and transport it,"" Maj. Michael Filanowski, a military operations officer, told reporters in Baghdad after the strike.The French defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said on Tuesday that his nation's warplanes had attacked more oil targets in the same region.It was France's fourth wave of strikes in Syria since President François Hollande decided in September to join the campaign there against the Islamic State, and the second in as many days.American commanders cautioned that it may take some time to gauge the impact of the new targeting, given the financial reserves the militant group has built up.Unlike measuring the immediate impact of bombing tanks or soldiers, ""it might be longer to feel the effect of oil fields,"" General Brown said.",1.0
"Damascus Accuses U.S. Coalition of Bombing Base, but Americans Point to the Russians:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Syria on Monday said a United States-led coalition had bombed a Syrian military base in the east of the country, killing three soldiers, wounding at least 13 and destroying vehicles and equipment. The United States denied the Syrian accusation and said a Russian warplane appeared to have been responsible.The Syrian accusation, in a statement carried by the official news agency, was the first time that President Bashar al-Assad's government had held the Americans responsible for bombing a Syrian military facility since the United States began airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria more than a year ago.The statement said that the bombing had been conducted Sunday evening in Deir al-Zour Province, and that Syria had sent letters of protest to the United Nations calling it ""a heinous aggression by the coalition.""American military officials said the coalition had carried out airstrikes in the province on Sunday, but they said no Syrian military positions had been struck. The Americans seemed anxious to avoid an escalation of tensions with Mr. Assad's government.A statement from the United States-led Combined Joint Task Force said that the coalition had conducted four airstrikes on Sunday, ""all against oil well heads,"" about 35 miles from the base. ""We did not strike any vehicles or personnel targets in this area,"" the statement said. ""We have no indication any Syrian soldiers were even near our strikes.""A senior United States official later attributed any deaths and any damage to the Syrian base to what he called ""a screw-up"" by the Russians, who joined the Syria war in September as allies of Mr. Assad and have conducted airstrikes with Backfire bombers and other aerial armaments.""We've got a radar track showing a Backfire bomber flying directly over the town that the Syrians named a few minutes before the first claims that we killed some Syrian troops,"" the American official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational details.Russian officials had no immediate comment on either the Syrian government's accusations against the American-led coalition or the American response implicating the Russians. But Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, reiterated what he called the need for a combined effort to vanquish extremist militants in Syria.""Both President Putin and Russian officials at various levels repeatedly emphasized our belief that an effective counteraction against these dangerous developments is only possible on the platform of a united coalition and an absolute coordination of any joint efforts,"" Mr. Peskov said in comments reported by Russia's Interfax news agency.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an independent monitoring group that tracks the conflict from Britain through a network of contacts on the ground, also reported on Monday that American coalition airstrikes had apparently hit a Syrian military post on Sunday near Ayyash, in the western part of Deir al-Zour.The United States has recently escalated its attacks in the province, with the stated aim of disrupting large oil fields controlled by the Islamic State, an important source of the group's revenue. In addition to the United States, Britain and France have recently started conducting airstrikes in Syria against the Islamic State.",1.0

The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, said the attack was the first United States strike against an Islamic State leader in Libya and predicted last month that it would degrade the group's ability to recruit members and establish bases in Libya.",1.0
Influx of Turkish Troops Angers Iraqi Officials:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Turkey has sent more troops, along with armored vehicles and tanks, to northern Iraq to support a longstanding mission to train Kurdish and Sunni Arab forces in the fight against the Islamic State, touching off an uproar in Baghdad, where officials called the move a violation of Iraqi sovereignty.The troop movements on the outskirts of Mosul apparently came in recent days and were done in coordination with the autonomous Kurdish government in northern Iraq, but not with the central government in Baghdad. They prompted the Iraqi foreign ministry to summon the Turkish ambassador in protest on Saturday and demand that the forces withdraw from Iraq.In a statement, the foreign ministry called the Turkish troop movements a hostile act and said they had been made ""without the knowledge of the Iraqi central government,"" adding, ""This is considered a violation and a breach of the sovereignty of the country."" Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and President Fuad Masum also voiced objections.Days earlier, Mr. Abadi, who came to power last year with the strong support of the United States, made a similarly tough statement in reaction to the United States' plans to deploy Special Operations forces to Iraq to conduct raids against Islamic State targets. He wrote on Facebook, ""Iraq doesn't need foreign ground troops,"" and added, ""This will be considered an act of aggression.""The reactions of the Iraqi authorities to the growing military role of the United States and Turkey inside Iraq highlighted Mr. Abadi's weakness as he seeks to balance his relationships with the West and Iran, which backs powerful militias in Iraq. Some of the leaders of those militias are popular on the Iraqi street and have sought to undermine Mr. Abadi, saying they will fight any foreign troops on Iraqi soil.In an interview on Saturday, Hakim al-Zamili, the head of Parliament's security committee and a Shiite militia leader, said the Iraqi military, if necessary, should strike the Turkish positions in the north.""I have sent a letter to Abadi and told him that Iraqi sovereignty must be respected, and we have weapons and F-16 planes and must use them to hit the Turkish military force in Mosul, so no one will dare violate the sovereignty of Iraq,"" he said.While a military confrontation seems unlikely, the controversy highlights the extent to which Iraq is divided, essentially split between areas controlled by the Islamic State, the northern Kurdish region, and a Shiite-dominated zone that includes Baghdad and the south and that represents the extent of the central government's control.For instance, Turkey has established its small military presence in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq without the approval of Baghdad. For nearly a year, it has trained a small group of largely Sunni Arab fighters. They are mostly former policemen from Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, which fell to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, last year.Turkish officials played down the new troop deployment, saying it was a routine move to support a continuing training mission in the north.""No one should interpret our help in a wrong way,"" Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey said Saturday, in remarks reported by the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency. ""Turkey does not have an eye on another country's soil, and she would never have. Turkey's struggle is against terror and terror organizations."" The news agency said 150 new troops had been deployed.Baghdad has been aware of Turkey's presence but chose to publicly challenge it only now -- underscoring, analysts say, the increasing pressure Mr. Abadi is facing from Iran and its proxies, including Iraq's former prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. In a report published last month, Ayham Kamel, the director for the Middle East and North Africa at the political risk firm Eurasia Group, predicted that Mr. Abadi would likely be ousted sometime next year.In the case of the United States, American officials say they negotiated with Mr. Abadi about the new deployments of Special Forces and believe his recent comments in defense of Iraqi sovereignty were made for domestic political reasons.Still, Mr. Abadi's increasingly weak position in the face of Iranian pressure complicates matters for the United States as it considers increasing its military presence in Iraq to fight the Islamic State.While the deal reached by the West and Iran to curb Iran's nuclear program raised hopes that Washington and Tehran could more closely coordinate campaigns against the Islamic State in Iraq, that now appears unlikely. The heads of powerful Iranian-backed militias have said they are willing to fight any new American troops in Iraq, as they did during the long American occupation after 2003.Rather than the United States' and Iran's becoming partners in the fight against the Islamic State, Iran's presence in Iraq is seen as a constraint on the American military's role there.Kirk H. Sowell, an analyst based in Amman, Jordan, and editor of the newsletter Inside Iraqi Politics, wrote in an email, ""The sending of ground forces to Iraq in any appreciable numbers would almost certainly open a new front in the war, with U.S. troops fighting Shia militias instead of Islamic State.""",1.0
Middle East; Yemen: Saudis to Investigate Clinic Raid:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- A military coalition led by Saudi Arabia said Friday that it would form a ""fact-finding committee"" to investigate allegations that coalition warplanes had bombed a clinic in Yemen operated by Doctors Without Borders earlier in the week, injuring nine people, according to a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.Doctors Without Borders said Thursday that it had repeatedly provided the coalition with the clinic's coordinates before the airstrikes, which occurred on Wednesday morning.The coalition has been fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen since March and controls the airspace over the country. The strikes on Wednesday were the second coalition attack on a Doctors Without Borders medical site in Yemen in less than two months.In a separate statement, Saudi Arabia urged aid agencies to coordinate movements with the coalition and to ""remain away from the places where the Houthi militias are present.""",1.0
"Iran Sent Arms to Iraq to Fight ISIS, U.S. Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"WASHINGTON -- Iran has deployed advanced rockets and missiles to Iraq to help fight the Islamic State in Tikrit, a significant escalation of firepower and another sign of Iran's growing influence in Iraq.United States intelligence agencies detected the deployments in the past few weeks as Iraq was marshaling a force of 30,000 troops -- two-thirds of them Shiite militias largely trained and equipped by Iran, according to three American officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence reports on Iran.Iran has not yet launched any of the weapons, but American officials fear the rockets and missiles could further inflame sectarian tensions and cause civilian casualties because they are not precision guided. Their deployment is another dilemma for the Obama administration as it trains and equips the Iraqi military and security services to help defeat the Islamic State, but unlike Iran is unwilling to commit fighters and advisers who join Iraqi forces in the field.One senior American military official who tracks classified intelligence reports said Iran had deployed Fajr-5 artillery rockets and Fateh-110 missiles and their launchers. Another senior American military official who also monitors sensitive government reports on Iran said the deployed weapons were similar to the Fajr-5 rockets and Fateh-110 missiles but were slightly different and had different names. The official offered no other details. The C.I.A. declined to comment.Either way, American officials agreed that the Iranian missiles introduced a new level of advanced weaponry to the battlefield in Iraq, even as some experts questioned their usefulness at this stage in the battle for Tikrit. But the Fajr-5 rockets are the same weapons that Hamas has fired against Israel in recent conflicts. Hezbollah and the Syrian Army have also been using Iranian rockets and missiles for some time, military specialists said.The second senior American military official said the Iranian missiles are ""not a big deal at this point,"" but then quickly added, ""My concern, as with artillery and other non-precise weapons, is collateral damage if they employ them.""There has been growing international pressure to avoid civilian casualties and revenge attacks on people or property in an operation by a mostly Shiite force in a hub of the so-called Sunni triangle. Appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 3, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, alluded to the deployment of the rockets and missiles when he said, ""This is the most overt conduct of Iranian support, in the form of artillery and other things.""General Dempsey also said that while the involvement of Iranian-backed Shiites in Tikrit could be ""a positive thing,"" he voiced concerns that ""it will only be a problem if it results in sectarianism.""That sentiment underscored the reality that even though American officials have deep reservations about Iran's enduring role in Iraq, Iraqis need Iranian help in defeating the Islamic State.""Are you concerned that Iran has basically taken over the fight?"" Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who heads the Armed Services Committee, asked Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter at the same March 3 hearing.""Sectarianism is what brought us to the point where we are,"" Mr. Carter replied. ""And so I do look at it with concern. We're watching it very closely.""American officials say they believe Iran imported the rockets and missiles for the Tikrit operation because other artillery was not able to reach targets around the city in what has become a difficult, protracted battle. Even after weeks of fighting, Islamic State militants remained dug in on Monday in Tikrit and still controlled parts of the city against the much larger pro-government force.And in a sign of how much this battle reflected the entire campaign against ISIS, Iraqi officials said they were pausing their offensive to summon reinforcements and to preserve property and civilian lives.The Fajr-5 rocket and Fateh-110 missile launching systems are typically carried on a specially designed truck and are formidable additions to the Iraqi arsenal. Fajr-5 rockets, which are named after the Persian word for dawn, have a range of about 45 miles. Each is 20 feet long and weighs more than 2,000 pounds. The Fajr-5 warhead alone weighs 375 pounds.It is unclear how many rockets and missiles the Iranians brought with launchers or how they would resupply their stockpile should the trained Iranian crews employ them, said one senior American military official.The Fateh-110 missile is even more capable than the Fajr-5, military specialists said on Monday, but they questioned the need for them in Tikrit now that the battle has moved to close-quarters, urban combat, when unguided rockets and missiles are not as useful. ""Generally speaking, these weapons are more effective at terrorizing civilians than providing fire support for ground operations,"" said Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation analyst at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. ""That is how Hezbollah has used them. I don't expect that either system will produce dramatically different results on the battlefield.""Military specialists speculated that Iranians might have brought the weapons into Iraq with the idea that they would use them if they could not effectively advance on Tikrit, and now may be keeping them there with the expectation of using them in a future battle, perhaps for the city of Mosul.Over all, the military specialists said it was not particularly surprising to see the Iranians deploying the advanced rockets and missiles to the fight in Iraq.These officials said that the deployment builds on a pattern of assistance that Iran and its proxies have provided Iraq since 2004, and most recently accelerated in an effort to blunt the Islamic State's momentum. Even as American warplanes provided cover, Iranian-trained Shiite militias last August broke a weeklong ISIS siege of Amerli, a group of farming villages whose Shiite residents faced possible annihilation.Last summer, when Islamic State militants first captured Mosul and got within striking distance of Erbil, the Kurdish capital, the head of Iran's Quds Force and its chief spymaster, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, flew to Erbil with two planes full of military supplies, American and regional diplomats said. The Iranian move helped to bolster Kurdish defenses around Erbil.In the Tikrit operation, General Suleimani was close at hand to help oversee the offensive led by Iranian-backed Shiite militia leaders that make up more than two-thirds of the pro-government force.His leadership did not go unnoticed in Washington. ""We are watching,"" General Dempsey said.Photograph United States Intelligence Officials Say That Fateh-110 Missiles, Like This One Displayed in 2010 in Tehran, Were Sent to Iraq.

Putin Says He Weighed Nuclear Alert Over Crimea:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- After the revolution in Ukraine last year, President Vladimir V. Putin sent military forces to secure Crimea and even weighed putting Russia's nuclear arsenal on alert because of his concerns about both anarchy and Western intervention, the Russian leader said in a documentary broadcast Sunday.The documentary, called ""Homeward Bound,"" was produced by the state-run Rossiya 1 channel to celebrate the anniversary of the March 21, 2014, annexation of Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that was given to Ukraine in 1954 when both were a part of the Soviet Union.The film presented the events as a triumph of security planning and execution, with Mr. Putin at its heart. Throughout the documentary, which ran for two and a half hours, Mr. Putin tried both to justify the move -- which most Western nations considered outside international law and led to economic sanctions that have magnified Russia's current, oil-related recession -- and to boast about it.""The overall tone is upbeat: Russia's greatness and fulsomeness being restored,"" wrote Dmitri V. Trenin, the head of the Carnegie Moscow Center, in response to a question via email. ""With respect to the U.S./West: keep away from this, it's our people, our historical land, our stakes are so much higher than yours, we will always outbid you if necessary.""The documentary appeared as a mood of unease gripped Moscow, not least because Mr. Putin has not been seen in public since March 5. His sudden withdrawal followed the Feb. 27 assassination of an opposition leader near the Kremlin, a killing that some analysts have suggested was rooted in a rivalry between different branches of the security services.Mr. Putin is scheduled to reappear in public on Monday, when he is supposed to meet the president of Kyrgyzstan in St. Petersburg.The takeover of Crimea, the site of an important Russian naval base, proved wildly popular with Russians, who always considered it a part of the motherland. In the aftermath, Mr. Putin's approval rating rose as high as 88 percent, even though the annexation and subsequent Russian support for separatists in Ukraine brought Moscow's relations with the West to their lowest point since the Cold War.""I was speaking with colleagues and said, 'Frankly, this is our historical territory and Russian people live there, they were in danger, and we cannot abandon them,' "" he said in the documentary.Before now, Mr. Putin had emphasized that he had felt compelled to act after the overwhelming majority of Crimeans approved a referendum on joining Russia.That element remains, but in the latest version Mr. Putin puts a much greater stress on the abrupt manner in which President Viktor F. Yanukovych of Ukraine was overthrown and on his own concerns about a potential Western military reaction.""We never thought about severing Crimea from Ukraine until the moment that these events began, the government overthrow,"" he said.Russia has never accepted the idea that Mr. Yanukovych was toppled by a popular revolution, instead saying that Europe and particularly the United States engineered the crowds that camped out in Kiev's Maidan square for months and eventually brought down the government on Feb. 21, 2014. ""The real puppeteers were our American partners and friends,"" Mr. Putin said.Mr. Putin said that he told his security chiefs at dawn on Feb. 23, after an all-night meeting, that it was time to start planning for the return of Crimea to Russia. He also said that concerns that the West might intervene militarily prompted him to consider putting Russia's nuclear weapons on alert. He was ready to face ""the worst possible turn of events,"" he said, but ultimately decided it was unnecessary.During the Soviet period, when Russia was considered a superpower, its nuclear arsenal was rarely if ever mentioned. More recently, as the West has categorized Russia as weak and not that important, the government and the state-run news media have repeatedly made not-so-subtle mention of the country's nuclear abilities.Mr. Putin said he sent thousands of troops, particularly the special forces, to secure Crimea and to ensure that some 20,000 Ukrainian soldiers there did not try to control it. ""We monitored the situation and had to bring in our equipment,"" Mr. Putin said. ""They would have been wiped out after the first salvo.""",1.0
Leading Role for France as Africa Battles Back:   [Foreign Desk ],,"NDJAMENA, Chad -- Deep in the Sahara, late at night, a Reaper drone silently tracked a six-vehicle convoy crossing the desert into Niger from Libya. Minutes later, French attack planes and helicopter gunships swooped down on the convoy of Qaeda-backed fighters, turning the militant caravan into smoldering wreckage.The raid last October by French combat aircraft and commandos killed or captured 15 Islamist fighters, and recovered nearly three tons of weapons, including Russian-designed SA-7 shoulder-fired missiles and several hundred anti-tank rockets, all bound for guerrilla operations in Mali, French officials said.The attack also provided a view of an increasingly violent, multifront campaign that France has joined here in the Sahel, a vast area on the southern flank of the Sahara that stretches from Senegal to Chad. The battle is being waged to combat Al Qaeda's affiliate in North Africa and other Islamist extremists in Mali, and more recently to thwart Boko Haram, a violent militancy that is spilling across from Nigeria to attack Chad, Niger and Cameroon.Last summer, France reorganized its 3,000-member force in West Africa to carry out its counterterrorism fight more effectively in some of the harshest terrain on the planet.The French military has concentrated its air power and mission headquarters here in Chad, its reconnaissance drones in Niger, its special operations troops in Burkina Faso, and its logistics hub in Ivory Coast. It has also deployed about 1,200 soldiers to Gao and another site in northern Mali to fight the remnants of militant organizations that French-led forces rolled back in early 2013.""The fight against terrorist groups is our daily business,"" said Gen. Jean-Pierre Palasset, the commander of the operation, called Barkhane, which means sand dune in French. General Palasset also led French troops in Afghanistan and the Ivory Coast.The mission is expanding to support regional African forces fighting Boko Haram, France's defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said last week. That will likely mean more operations like the one last month in which a French team in the city of Diffa, in southeastern Niger just across from Nigeria, collected intelligence on Boko Haram.Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Benin, along with Nigeria, have agreed to contribute 8,700 troops to a regional force to contain and, it is hoped, defeat Boko Haram after the group seized territory the size of Belgium in northeastern Nigeria and then staged cross-border attacks. African troops have since regained some towns.""The question is not about numbers but how we provide support in terms of planning, logistics and intelligence to our African allies,"" said a senior French Defense Ministry official in Paris. ""It could be 100 or 200 additional officers. We need to support the Cameroonians, the Chadians. We don't intend to be ahead of them; we need to be there to help them.""French officials have paid close attention to fast-shifting developments in the region. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, held meetings in Chad, Cameroon and Niger last month to discuss security threats.In January, Mr. Le Drian visited Madama, a new forward-operating base in northern Niger, 60 miles from the Libyan border. With more than 200 troops and combat helicopters based there, the outpost is designed to stanch the flow of foreign fighters, terrorists and criminal smugglers coursing down from the mayhem in largely ungoverned southern Libya into sparsely populated and lightly defended Niger and Mali.France, which has the United Nations Security Council presidency in March, is also pushing for a resolution by early April that would back the regional African force to fight Boko Haram, providing it with crucial financing to carry out operations.The Obama administration, which is already fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has been only too eager to provide financial, logistical and intelligence support to France to avoid having to put American combat forces on the ground in yet another global hot spot.""There's a lot of merit to partnering with the French who have sort of staked out their claim in the Sahel region of North Africa,"" James R. Clapper Jr., the American director of national intelligence, told a Senate committee last month. ""They have history and heritage there, access, and have committed to deploying troops in that area, boots on the ground, which we can supplement.""Last August, President Obama authorized the Pentagon to send France $10 million to help pay for troop transport and aerial refueling.""There's already an unprecedented degree of coordination, with both the U.S. and France bringing complementary strengths to the table,"" said Michael R. Shurkin, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst who is now at the RAND Corporation. ""The more the U.S. and France work together, the greater the regional alliance's chance of success.""That regional cooperation began in earnest in January 2013 when French forces led a military operation that largely expelled Qaeda-linked extremists from a vast area they had controlled in northeastern Mali.Since last August, personnel assigned to the French counterterrorism operations, working with African security forces, have killed or captured about 100 militants, French officials said. French attack planes have carried out several strikes in just the past few months in northern Mali.Last December, French troops working with Malian authorities near Gao killed Ahmed al-Tilemsi, who had a $5 million bounty on his head after the State Department listed him as a ""specially designated global terrorist.""Mr. Tilemsi, a Mali native, was a leader of Al Mourabitoun, a group formed by extremists who split off from the Qaeda affiliate here two years ago. The extremists led an attack on the In Amenas gas plant in Algeria in 2013 and killed at least 37 foreign hostages taken during the assault.More recently, French forces joined 800 troops from Mauritania and Mali in a show-of-force mission west of Timbuktu near the Mauritanian border.In addition to the threat from Boko Haram, French officials have voiced increasing concern about members of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, and other extremists using southwestern Libya as a safe haven and as a logistic base mainly for fuel and ammunition.It is an area that is also commanding increasing concern in Washington, and drawing the two countries closer. ""We have absolutely overlapping interests here,"" James Knight, the United States ambassador to Chad, said in an interview here. ""The cooperation is seamless.""",1.0
"Poles Steel for Battle, Fearing Russia Will March on Them Next:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"KALISZ, Poland -- For evidence of how much President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has jangled nerves and provoked anxiety across Eastern Europe, look no farther than the drill held the other day by the Shooters Association.The paramilitary group, like more than 100 others in Poland, has experienced a sharp spike in membership since Mr. Putin's forces began meddling in neighboring Ukraine last year.Thirty students took an oath to defend Poland at all costs, joining nearly 200 other regional members of the association -- young men and women, boys and girls -- marching in formation around the perimeter of the dusty high school courtyard here. They crossed Polish Army Boulevard and marched into the center of town, sprawling in four long lines along the edge of St. Joseph's Square.Gen. Boguslaw Pacek, an adviser to the Polish defense minister and the government's chief liaison with these paramilitary groups, marched with them. He has been making the rounds in recent months of such gatherings: student chapters like this one, as well as groups of veterans, even battle re-enactors.One of those who took the oath in Kalisz was Bartosz Walesiak, 16, who said he had been interested in the military since playing with toy soldiers as a little boy, but had been motivated to join the Shooters Association after Russia moved into Crimea.""I think that Putin will want more,"" he said.""Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia are already getting ready for such a scenario, so Poland must do the same.""As the crisis drags on, what was unthinkable at the end of the Cold War now seems not quite so unlikely to many Poles: that the great Russian behemoth will not be sated with Ukraine and will reach out once again into the West. The thought is darkening the national mood and rippling across the entire region in ways that reflect a visceral fear of an aggressive and unpredictable Russia.Pointing out that Russia insists it has no such intentions usually elicits little more than a despairing laugh.""I think the impact on everyday life is starting to be very bad,"" said Marcin Zaborowski, director of the Polish Institute of International Affairs. ""Very often now, people approach me -- neighbors, hairdressers -- asking whether there will be a war. The other day, my mother called and asked me.""Dinner parties in Warsaw these days frequently drift to the topic. Possibilities that were once shrugged off are now seriously contemplated. Even the jokes are laced with anxiety.In January, the Polish Ministry of National Defense announced that it would provide military training to any civilian who wished to receive it, with registration beginning March 1. About 1,000 people showed up the first day, said Col. Tomasz Szulejko, spokesman for the Polish Army's general staff. ""This number certainly bodes well for the future,"" he said.Tomasz Siemoniak, Poland's defense minister, is also contemplating a proposal to establish a Territorial Defense Force, taking the cream of the members of the paramilitary associations and other volunteers to create something akin to the National Guard in the United States.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz changed the law on who can be called up for service in case of ""military maneuvers."" Previously, the armed forces could summon only current and former reservists, those with actual military training. Now, if necessary, they can call on almost any man in the country.In neighboring Lithuania, President Dalia Grybauskaite said her government intended to reinstate military conscription because of the ""current geopolitical environment.""In January, the government issued a 98-page booklet (""How to Act in Extreme Situations or Instances of War"") that offered advice on what citizens should do if foreign soldiers appeared on their doorstep, and how they might offer passive resistance to an occupying power.""If you are a civilian and you make that clear, it is unlikely someone will rush to kill you,"" the booklet advised, urging people not to panic. Even hearing shots fired outside your home ""is not the end of the world,"" it said.""People come up and ask me: 'Should we leave? Should we flee?' "" said Karlis Bukovskis, deputy director of the Latvian Institute of International Affairs in Riga. ""This is a new development. This is the first time that has happened to me.""Worries are increasing in Poland, but they have not yet reached the level of mass fear, said Tomasz Szlendak, a sociologist at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun who has studied the effects the Ukraine crisis is having in Poland.At a recent party of fellow academics, he said, one retired military officer announced that he would organize a local militia if the Russians invaded. Another professor declared that he would put his wife and daughter on a plane out of Poland with a bag of money and then sign up with one of the paramilitary groups.""These kind of comments are, of course, meant as jokes,"" Mr. Szlendak said. ""But they are based on real fear. They are humorless, sad jokes.""The situation has not quite gotten to the point that people are stockpiling food and ammunition in the basement, said Mr. Zaborowski of the Polish Institute of International Affairs, but anxiety is definitely rising.Pawel Kowal, a former member of Poland's Parliament and a foreign policy expert, said the country was getting parallel messages from its leaders, being told that a newly aggressive Russia poses a genuine threat while also being reassured that membership in NATO and the European Union will provide sufficient protection.""The sense is that the border between NATO and Russia is like a new Iron Curtain,"" Mr. Kowal said. ""But at least this time, Poland is on the right side of it.""The growing enrollment in the paramilitary groups is just one manifestation of the changed climate. The number of groups, General Pacek said, is clearly rising. Not all of the increase is due to Ukraine -- patriotism and uniformed service are becoming more fashionable among younger Poles, and the military does offer a stable career -- but Mr. Putin's shadow has certainly accelerated the trend, he said.A gathering a few days earlier in the city of Szczecin had 500 new cadets taking the oath. General Pacek estimated there were 120 such groups at the moment, with about 80,000 members, but he acknowledged that this was just a guess, as the groups are not required to report their existence or membership rolls.The Defense Ministry has been trying to entice the groups to join an alliance with the government, offering equipment, uniforms, training and even money in exchange for a clearer idea of who they are -- and a chance to assemble a new generation of energized recruits.""There is no question of them doing any fighting,"" General Pacek said. ""They are to offer assistance to the military. But of course, they have to be prepared to defend.""In St. Joseph's Square, the 30 new members of the Shooting Association waited for the command before taking four purposeful steps forward and raising their right hands.""I hereby pledge to put the good of the Polish Republic above all else,"" they repeated. ""I will always be ready to defend its independence until my last breath.""After the ceremony, Grzegorz Sapinski, the mayor of Kalisz, watched the cadets march down the cobblestone streets back to the school.""One cannot help but notice the change in attitudes among young people following what is happening in Ukraine,"" Mr. Sapinski said. ""The conflict is not in some obscure place. It is happening four hours' drive away.""The members of one squad from the Shooters Association were splayed on their bellies on the edge of the school's soccer field, pushing themselves ahead one knee thrust at a time. Each held a prop AK-47, and Capt. Lukasz Kolcz, the chapter's commander, barked at them to keep low and move forward.The youngest of the cadets, Grzegorz Zurek, 11, was having trouble keeping up, but he was stubbornly determined. As they arrived on the far side of the field, the cadets turned to cheer Grzegorz along.""I think it is highly probable that Putin will do something against Poland,"" Grzegorz later said. ""I know from history that Russia has always been a totalitarian state. Now it is trying to regain the territory it lost at the end of the Cold War.""He rested his rubber-coated gun on the soft, perfect grass.""Should it invade Poland,"" he said, ""I would not hesitate a second to fight against them.""Photograph Members of One of Poland's More Than 100 Paramilitary Groups Trained in Kalisz This Month.

Chinese General Warns Myanmar:   [Foreign Desk ],,"HONG KONG -- Tensions between China and Myanmar deepened on Saturday when a Chinese military commander warned of a strong response unless Myanmar prevented warfare with ethnic rebel groups from spilling into Chinese territory.The commander, Gen. Fan Changlong, a vice chairman of China's Central Military Commission, issued the warning after four Chinese farmers died on Friday when a military plane from Myanmar dropped a bomb in China near the two countries' border, Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, reported. Myanmar's forces have been fighting rebel forces in Kokang, an ethnic Chinese enclave next to the Chinese border.""The top echelons in the Myanmar military must strictly control and restrain their forces, and there can be absolutely no repeat of such incidents,"" General Fan told the commander in chief of Myanmar's military, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, in a telephone call, Xinhua said. ""Otherwise, the Chinese military will take resolute and decisive measures to protect Chinese people's lives and property.""General Fan repeated the Chinese government's demand for a thorough inquiry by Myanmar of the bombing, and harsh punishment for those found responsible.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; China: Deadly Intrusion Is Denounced:   [Foreign Desk ],,"HONG KONG -- Four farmers in southwest China were killed Friday when one or more bombs released from a warplane from Myanmar struck a sugar cane field, as fighting between Myanmar's government forces and an ethnic group pressed against the frontier with China.The deaths, reported by Chinese state-run television, appeared to be the worst instance so far of the recently renewed conflict between Myanmar's army and armed supporters of the Kokang people, an ethnic Chinese minority, rippling into neighboring Yunnan Province in China. Another nine people were wounded by the bombing, said Xinhua, the main Chinese state news agency.Late on Friday, a Chinese vice minister for foreign affairs, Liu Zhenmin, summoned Myanmar's ambassador in Beijing, U Thit Linn Ohn, to denounce the deaths and the intrusion into Chinese territory, Xinhua reported. The reports did not say whether the Chinese government thought the intrusion was deliberate or accidental.""We urge the Myanmar side to thoroughly investigate this incident and report the findings to the Chinese side, and to sternly punish the perpetrator,"" Mr. Liu told the ambassador, according to Xinhua.""Immediately take effective steps to prevent incidents like this from recurring, and thoroughly safeguard the security and stability of the China-Myanmar border region,"" Mr. Liu said.The Xinhua report in English indicated that Myanmar's plane dropped one bomb. But the Global Times, a popular Chinese newspaper that has often reported on the conflict, initially said the cane field was struck three times.The deaths threaten to complicate China's position in responding to fighting between Myanmar government forces and armed supporters of the Kokang, who call themselves the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army. The conflict flared in February, prompting tens of thousands of residents of the region, which is also known as Kokang, to flee into Yunnan. The last big eruption of fighting in the Kokang area was in 2009.The Kokang people have deep cultural, commercial and often personal ties with China, and are often barely distinguishable from inhabitants of Yunnan Province. In the eyes of Chinese sympathizers, they are a beleaguered minority deserving Beijing's support, and the hardships of Kokang refugees have been reported by the Chinese media, drawing an outpouring of supportive comments online.But Beijing has sought to shore up its increasingly brittle relations with the Myanmar government, and has insisted that it abides by a principle of not meddling in other countries' domestic problems. The government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, has accused rebels of staging attacks from Chinese territory, a claim denied by Beijing and Kokang leaders.At a news conference in Beijing on Sunday, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, said China was closely watching the fighting between Myanmar's forces and the Kokang fighters.""We are friendly neighbors, sharing not just mountains and rivers, but also weal and woe,"" Mr. Wang said, according to Xinhua. ""When problems arise in our neighbor's house, we follow the situation very closely.""The Chinese Air Force set up teams of fighter jets a number of times Friday to tail and warn Myanmar military planes and force them out of Chinese airspace, the state-run China News Service quoted an air force spokesman as saying Saturday. The air force will step up operations along the border with Myanmar, said the spokesman, Shen Jinke.The two countries share a 1,367 mile-long border, and other conflicts between the Myanmar government and armed ethnic groups on the fractious frontier have also spilled over. In 2013, reports said three people died in a Chinese border town from shelling when Myanmar's army was fighting the Kachin Independence Army.The Global Times said Myanmar Air Force planes had entered Chinese airspace at least four times in the current fighting. This week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that on Sunday a house on Chinese soil was flattened by a stray shell from the fighting.The bomb from Myanmar's warplane hit the sugar cane field in Gema County on Friday afternoon, China Central Television news said. The Global Times showed pictures on its website, which it said showed the aftermath: distraught villagers standing over covered bodies, and wooden burial coffins readied for the dead.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
U.S. Targets Shabab Unit in Somalia:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The United States has carried out airstrikes against a senior member of the Shabab extremist group who is believed to have helped plan the 2013 attack on the Westgate mall in Kenya, American officials said Friday.Pentagon officials said they were still assessing the results of a drone strike, carried out Thursday against the senior member, Adan Garar, and two other militants near a Somali town west of Mogadishu, not far from the border with Kenya. It was unclear whether Mr. Garar and his associates had been killed, they said.""U.S. military forces conducted a counterterrorism operation in Somalia yesterday, March 12, against the Al Shabab network,"" said Col. Steve Warren, a Defense Department spokesman. ""We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate.""For nearly a decade, the United States has been trying to fight the Shabab through economic sanctions, missile strikes and commando raids. Last year, the Obama administration stepped up its efforts, and in September an American drone strike killed the leader of the Shabab, Ahmed Abdi Godane, one of the most wanted men in Africa.At the time, President Obama drew a direct link between the killing of Mr. Godane, who turned an obscure Somali militant group into one of the most fearsome franchises of Al Qaeda in the world, and American plans for the leaders of the Islamic State in Iraq. The Pentagon press secretary at the time, Rear Adm. John F. Kirby, called the death of Mr. Godane ""a major symbolic and operational loss"" to the Shabab.But if the Shabab suffered a major setback with the killing of Mr. Godane, the group's remaining leaders have vowed to attack in Kenya, Uganda and Somalia.The siege on the upscale Westgate mall in Nairobi, where dozens were killed, heightened American concerns that the Shabab's desire to inflict casualties extended beyond Somalia.Defense officials cautioned that they did not know yet if the drone strikes were successful in killing Mr. Garar or any other Shabab leaders. In the Godane case last year, it took several days of monitoring cellphone traffic, questioning Somali officials on the ground and poring over reports from both American and British intelligence agencies before the death was confirmed.But Ben Mulwa, 34, who was wounded in the attack on the Westgate mall, said he hoped the claims were true.""We've been looking to see that justice be done,"" he said.Mr. Mulwa, who is now a coordinator for the Terror Victims Support Initiative, a grassroots group that lobbies for support and compensation for victims of terrorism in Kenya, said the Shabab were continuing to make threats. ""This assures us that something is being done,"" he said.Mwenda Mbijiwe, a counterterrorism analyst in Kenya, said he believed that the small and tight-knit nature of the Shabab's top leadership meant that the group would ""be affected in a big way"" with the loss of Mr. Garar even if it continued to carry out attacks.On Friday, the Shabab claimed responsibility for an attack on a governor's convoy in northern Kenya near the border with Somalia that claimed the lives of three people.""Those who take over may take a more extreme approach, to say, 'We are still here,' "" Mr. Mbijiwe said.",1.0
Europe; Ukraine: Villagers Say They Saw Missile Just Before Civilian Jet Was Shot Down:   [Brief ],,"Villagers in eastern Ukraine have said they saw a missile flying directly overhead just before a Malaysian airliner was shot down last July, providing the most detailed accounts to date that suggest that the missile was fired from territory held by pro-Russian rebels. The accounts given to Reuters by four residents of Chervonyi Zhovten, which was then, and is now, controlled by the rebels, indicate that they saw the missile in the early stages of its flight path. That would mean it must have been launched from rebel ground nearby, challenging the claims of Moscow and the separatists that the plane was shot down by Ukraine's military. At the time, the nearest Ukrainian-held area was about 3.7 miles away. None of the villagers saw the missile being launched, but Ukraine and its Western allies have said the rebels shot down the airliner. All 298 people on board were killed. A Kremlin spokesman said a Dutch-led international investigation would determine what happened.",1.0
Putin Contradicts Claims on Annexation of Crimea:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has publicly indicated for the first time that the planning to reclaim Crimea from Ukraine started weeks before the Crimean referendum on the issue, which he had cited repeatedly as the main reason for Russia's annexation.Mr. Putin said he made the decision around 7 a.m. on Feb. 23, 2014, after an all-night emergency meeting with his security chiefs on the crisis in Ukraine. Viktor F. Yanukovych had just been deposed as the president of Ukraine, and the meeting was called to discuss his rescue, Mr. Putin said.Russia has long contended that it acted spontaneously to reclaim Crimea, mainly to protect Russian speakers who it said had been threatened, and to stave off what it suspected was an attempt by NATO to colonize the Black Sea.Mr. Putin in particular has emphasized the role of the March 16 referendum in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted to rejoin Russia.But in a clip shown late Sunday from a new documentary called ""Homeward Bound,"" produced by state-run Channel One television, Mr. Putin put a different emphasis on events.""I invited the leaders of our special services and the Defense Ministry to the Kremlin and gave them the task of saving the life of the Ukrainian president, who simply would have been liquidated,"" he said in an interview for the documentary, speaking about the night of Feb. 22.Mr. Yanukovych had fled Kiev for southeastern Ukraine, and he eventually made his way to Russia.""We finished about seven in the morning,"" Mr. Putin said. ""When we were parting, I told all my colleagues, 'We are obliged to begin working to bring Crimea back into Russia.' ""That one sentence appears to indicate that Mr. Putin made the decision more than three weeks before the referendum, but the clip from the documentary does not show any more of the interview. Channel One did not specify when the full documentary would be broadcast.Within days of the meeting at the Kremlin, unidentified soldiers began to overrun Crimea, raising the Russian flag over captured government buildings and expelling the Ukrainian military.At the time Mr. Putin denied Russia was involved, but he later admitted that the troops were in fact Russian special forces.The annexation proved wildly popular in Russia and has helped keep Mr. Putin's approval rating well above 80 percent for the year. His revelation about his decision comes as the annexation's first anniversary approaches.In remarks broadcast last year, Mr. Putin said the final decision was based on ""public sentiment."" He said the government first conducted secret opinion polls, which showed 80 percent of Crimea's population supported the annexation, and then the referendum results were even stronger.Speaking elsewhere last year, on a national call-in show, Mr. Putin said that he had delayed a decision while awaiting the referendum results.

Neighbors of Nigeria Take On Boko Haram:   [Foreign Desk ],,"DAKAR, Senegal -- Troops from Chad and Niger launched an offensive against Boko Haram militants in neighboring Nigeria, military officials from both countries said Monday, two days after the Islamist terrorist group killed scores in bombings in northeastern Nigeria.A military official in the Niger border city of Diffa confirmed Monday that two columns of military vehicles carrying soldiers from Niger and Chad had moved into Boko Haram's stronghold in Nigeria's Borno State on Sunday, consolidating control over two frontier towns, Damasak and Malam Fatori.Chad had previously reported that its forces had pushed Boko Haram out of the two towns in mid-February. But Monday was Niger's turn to do so. Chad's military spokesman hung up the phone when questioned about the discrepancy, though the spokesman, Col. Azem Bermandoa Agouna, did say that forces from the two neighboring countries were ""in coalition"" in the regional fight against Boko Haram.""The armed forces have launched themselves into the fight to recover the town,"" Colonel Azem said Monday from Ndjamena, the Chadian capital, referring to Damasak, a Boko Haram staging post for attacks.Control of the border towns has changed hands several times, and the situation in other remote towns in territory controlled by Boko Haram remains ambiguous. The Nigerian Army, which up until last month had conceded swaths of territory to the Islamist insurgents, is sensitive over the military assistance provided by its smaller neighbors.With a national election scheduled for March 28 and a pledge by military officials to stamp out Boko Haram before the vote, activity by Nigerian forces has intensified, as have efforts by the country's neighbors, who are worried about the effects of the insurgency on their economies. Boko Haram has increased cross-border raids into Cameroon, Chad and Niger in recent months.Facing direct engagement from government forces, Boko Haram has reverted to old tactics, bombing so-called soft targets in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri. Fifty to 100 people were killed in four bombings over the weekend at two crowded markets in the city.The attacks were grimly familiar, with women concealing explosives under their hijabs. In one attack on Saturday at Maiduguri's Monday Market, vigilantes forced a woman whom they suspected of carrying a bomb to the ground, only to be blown up as she detonated it. Nigerian reporters at another attack on Saturday at the Baga Fish Market noted that a number of the victims were children.",1.0
Refinery in Syria Is Target of Airstrike:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIRUT -- An American-led coalition airstrike in Syria hit an oil refinery run by Islamic State militants near the border with Turkey on Sunday, killing 30 people, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.Rami Abdul Rahman, director of the observatory, a monitoring group based in Britain, said the dead were refinery workers and militants. The targeted refinery was just northeast of the town of Tel Abyad near the Turkish border, he said.A spokesman for the United States Combined Joint Task Force overseeing the fight against the Islamic State said that when accusations of civilian casualties caused by the coalition are deemed credible, a thorough investigation begin.The Islamic State has seized wide areas of Syria and Iraq, including oil-producing regions that have financed its activities.In November, the United Nations estimated the Islamic State's revenue from oil at $846,000 to $1.6 million a day. However, the Pentagon says oil is no longer the group's main source of revenue. Western diplomats have said this was because of airstrikes on oil installations and a plunge in global oil prices.",1.0
"In a Test of Wills, Japanese Fighter Pilots Confront Chinese:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"NAHA, Japan -- Once a sleepy, sun-soaked backwater, this air base on the southern island of Okinawa has become the forefront of a dangerous test of wills between two of Asia's largest powers, Japan and China.At least once every day, Japanese F-15 fighter jets roar down the runway, scrambling to intercept foreign aircraft, mostly from China. The Japanese pilots say they usually face lumbering reconnaissance planes that cruise along the edge of Japanese-claimed airspace before turning home. But sometimes -- exactly how often is classified -- they face nimbler Chinese fighter jets in knuckle-whitening tests of piloting skills, and self-control.""Intercepting fighters is always more nerve-racking,"" said Lt. Col. Hiroyuki Uemura, squadron commander of the approximately 20 F-15 fighters stationed here at Naha Air Base. ""We hold our ground, but we don't provoke.""The high-velocity encounters over the East China Sea have made the skies above these strategic waters some of the tensest in the region, unnerving Pentagon planners concerned that a slip-up could cause a war with the potential to drag in the United States. Japan's refusal to back down over months of consistent challenges also represents a rare display of military spine by this long-dovish nation, and one that underscores just how far the rise of China and its forceful campaign to control nearby seas has pushed Japan out of its pacifist shell.Under its nationalistic prime minister, Shinzo Abe, Japan has embarked on the most sweeping overhaul of its defense posture in recent memory. Not only has Mr. Abe reversed a decade-long decline in military spending as part of what he calls ""proactive pacifism,"" but his government is also rewriting laws to lift restrictions on Japan's armed forces, which are already taking a more active role as far afield as the Gulf of Aden.It was, in fact, a speech by Mr. Abe that included tough statements on the Islamic State and an aid package to fight extremism that the militants cited as the reason they beheaded two Japanese hostages in January. Videos showing the men's bodies, posted online, gained Mr. Abe some traction for his notion that Japan must be more prepared to take on those who mean it harm.At the heart of Mr. Abe's strategy is a drive to create a more public profile for Japan's military, the Self-Defense Forces, which have been strictly limited to defending the Japanese homeland since their creation in 1954, and which for decades afterward were barely acknowledged by a public leery of anything resembling Japan's World War II era militarism. Although Mr. Abe still does not have enough public support for his long-stated goal of constitutional changes to permit Japan a full-fledged military, he is pushing Japan's purely defensive armed forces into an unfamiliar role as the standard-bearer of a more assertive foreign policy, and a deterrent against a modernizing Chinese military.""Japan is saying, 'Uh-oh, maybe with a rising China we have to start thinking differently,' "" said Sheila A. Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. ""For the first time since World War II, Japan is finding itself on the front line. And for the first time, it has to ask itself, what does an independent defense plan look like?""Rebuilt after Japan's defeat in 1945 at the encouragement of the United States, the country's technologically advanced military took a secondary role to American forces, helping patrol strategic sea lanes in the face of a Cold War-era Soviet threat. The Self-Defense Forces' role has expanded over the decades -- Japan sent 1,000 noncombat support troops to Iraq in 2004, its biggest overseas deployment since World War II -- even though the country still bars itself from possessing offensive weapons like cruise missiles considered necessary to launch full-blown attacks.With a quarter of a million uniformed personnel, Japan has slowly built up a military larger than that of other midlevel powers like France or Israel, though still far smaller than the 2.3 million-strong People's Liberation Army in China.Just how far the Self-Defense Forces have come is evident here in the islands of Okinawa, where Japan's armed forces have been assigned a more demanding -- and publicly visible -- mission.The Naha base is just a 20-minute flight by fighter jet from disputed islands that Japan controls, but China claims as its own. The islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, have provided the kindling for smoldering resentment between the countries.As China has stepped up the pressure in recent years by sending more planes and ships to patrol the islands, Japan has scrambled jets to shadow potential intruders and deployed advanced E-2 radar planes with huge dishes mounted on top to keep tabs on the Chinese while it builds a radar station on nearby Yonaguni island, Japan's first new base in decades.The tug-of-war over the islands is a proxy for a much larger battle over the shifting power balance in Asia, where China has begun to overturn the century-long supremacy of Japan, its ancient rival. Chinese military planners have called the Okinawan islands, including the disputed ones, part of China's ""first island chain"" of defense, meaning that they hope to eventually control the waters west of Japan where the United States and Japan have long held sway.While low-growth Japan is aware that it cannot match China's rapidly expanding military spending, it is trying to position its Self-Defense Forces to thwart China from trying to snatch the disputed islands, as well as to deter any designs on other Japanese-held islands. The legal changes Mr. Abe's government is working on would further free the military to come to the aid of an ally under attack, part of a broader strategy to turn Japan into a fuller military partner of the United States to try to ensure that Washington will come to Tokyo's aid if fighting breaks out over the islands.Defense analysts and American commanders agree that Japan's strongest asset is its Maritime Self-Defense Force, or MSDF, widely regarded as the world's second-most capable navy after the United States's. With a tradition dating back to Japan's formidable wartime fleet, and top hardware like the Aegis radar system, the Japanese have the only naval force, except perhaps Britain's, with the ability to work so fully and seamlessly with the United States fleet, American commanders say.This was apparent during naval war games in November involving almost 30 Japanese and American warships. As the huge American aircraft carrier George Washington launched F-18 jets, its closest escort was the Japanese guided-missile destroyer Kirishima. For the first time during such a complex exercise, a Japanese admiral was in charge of both navies' defense against simulated seaborne attacks.""The MSDF is the most capable maritime ally that we have,"" said Vice Adm. Robert L. Thomas Jr., commander of the Japan-based Seventh Fleet.While China's navy added its first aircraft carrier in 2012, defense analysts say Japan still enjoys a decades-wide advantage not only in technology but also in experience operating large warships. Japan has more of these larger, blue-water vessels like destroyers, and some of the world's stealthiest submarines.Last year, Japan launched its largest warship since World War II, the Izumo, a small aircraft carrier capable of carrying vertical-takeoff jets. The Izumo is part of a more mobile military that Japan is building to defend its far-flung islands to the south, including the contested ones -- with or without the United States, if necessary.Still, analysts say, time is on China's side, as its economic growth rates allow ever larger military budgets. While Japan's defense budget rose 2.8 percent to a record 4.98 trillion yen, or $42 billion in 2015, China announced on Thursday that its own military spending would jump 10.1 percent in the same year, to an estimated $145 billion.""The more the U.S. and Japan will do, the more China will do,"" Shen Dingli, associate dean of the Institute for International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, wrote in an email.Here at the Naha Air Base, the Japanese pilots said they tried to keep their edge with constant training. On a recent morning, they sent up a pair of F-15s to respond to a simulated intrusion, played by three other F-15s.A growing number of Chinese aircraft over the East China Sea is also keeping Naha busy, so much so that the base plans to add a second F-15 squadron this year. In a nine-month period ending last December, its pilots scrambled 379 times to intercept foreign aircraft -- a sixfold jump from those same months in 2010.""Every year, China's operational capabilities seem to be rising,"" said the Naha base commander, Maj. Gen. Yasuhiko Suzuki. ""Every year, our level of anxiety rises along with them.""",1.0
"World Briefing | Europe; Ukraine: More Than 9,100 People Killed Since Outbreak of Hostilities, U.N. Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"GENEVA -- At least 9,115 people have been killed in the 21 months since the outbreak of hostilities in eastern Ukraine in April 2014, United Nations monitors in Ukraine reported on Wednesday, an increase of more than a thousand since the United Nations' last estimate, in September. An estimated 20,797 have been injured.The casualty estimates are based on new information and do not represent an uptick in fighting, said the monitors, from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.The pace of the killing has slowed since a cease-fire in August, the monitors said, with 47 civilians killed and 131 injured in the three months ended in mid-November. They warned, however, that extrajudicial killings and torture persist in regions controlled by separatists, and that the continuing movement of foreign fighters and arms from Russia were keeping the situation ""highly flammable.""The figures are conservative, said Gianni Magazzeni, a senior United Nations human rights official, adding that the real toll is most likely significantly higher. ""There remain a large number of unidentified bodies in morgues,"" he said, especially in areas controlled by armed groups.More than half the casualties in the latest reporting period were attributed to land mines and improvised explosive devices, ""underscoring the urgent need for extensive mine clearance and mine awareness actions on both sides"" of the contact line separating Ukraine government security forces from rebel groups controlling areas around the eastern towns of Donetsk and Luhansk, the monitors found.However, the lack of government control of Ukraine's eastern border allowed the continuing movement of weapons, ammunition and fighters from Russia, which ""carries latent risks of a resurgence of hostilities.,"" they reported.Armed groups and government security services continued to commit serious abuses, the monitors said, and living conditions remained difficult for some 2.9 million people living in the areas of conflict with limited access to humanitarian aid and medical care.Extrajudicial killings, torture, illegal detention and forced labor continued in areas around Donetsk and Luhansk, the monitors said, reporting that they had no access to the places of detention run by the armed groups controlling them.""These are the places where human rights abuses are most frequently reported and where victims are most vulnerable,"" Mr. Magazzeni told reporters here.The United Nations also drew attention to hardships for civilians created by the restrictions on movements imposed by the Ukrainian government, and to the ""high degree of impunity"" enjoyed by security services, which it accused of abuses including enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and torture.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
U.S. Is Willing to Use Attack Helicopters to Help Iraqis Fight ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The United States is prepared to deploy attack helicopters and additional advisers to help Iraqi forces in their long-running battle to retake the city of Ramadi from the Islamic State, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said Wednesday.For several months now, the Iraqi security forces have been advancing on the city, cordoning it off and surrounding it. It has been a slog, Pentagon officials say, because of entrenched Islamic State positions.But as the forces make what they have billed as their final push into the city center, which will entail urban warfare, defense officials say they are considering the use of American attack helicopters. Such a move would deepen American involvement in the war and could bring helicopter pilots under increased risk from ground fire, but the Pentagon views it as a necessary step.""The United States is prepared to assist the Iraqi Army with additional unique capabilities to help them finish the job, including attack helicopters and accompanying advisers, if circumstances dictate and if requested by Prime Minister Abadi,"" Mr. Carter told a hearing Wednesday of the Senate Armed Services Committee, referring to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq.But officials said they did not envision using the American helicopters until the effort to retake Ramadi reached a critical point and such a move would be necessary to finish the job.An American military official, who asked not to be identified because he was discussing internal deliberations, said the offer to provide Apache helicopters and field advisers had recently been conveyed privately to Mr. Abadi. Mr. Abadi -- who is under pressure from hard-line Shiite politicians backed by Iran not to accept an expanded American role in Iraq -- neither accepted nor rejected the proposal, suggesting that he would weigh the offer on a case-by-case basis, according to American and Iraqi officials.Currently, the American trainers and advisers who have been working with Iraqi troops stay on bases in Iraq. If advisers were to be deployed in the field, they would be attached to select Iraqi brigades.David H. Petraeus, the former United States commander, has told Congress that the United States should consider advising Iraqi forces in the field at the brigade level.The Obama administration and the Abadi government are each walking tightropes in order to navigate the fight against the Islamic State amid the Shiite-Sunni divide in Iraq.Shiite militia leaders and politicians who are close to Iran seem to be more concerned with limiting the scope of the American involvement in Iraq than in having the Iraqi government quickly retake Ramadi, the capital of Sunni-dominated Anbar Province. But the United States is concerned that the Iraqi offensive, which is being carried out by the Iraqi Army, may drag on.Obama administration officials debated in June whether American Apache attack helicopters should be used to retake Ramadi, but the White House only recently decided to offer that option to the Iraqis.On Tuesday, Iraqi security forces recaptured a onetime military police headquarters in northern Ramadi from the Islamic State, a Pentagon official said, and Iraq's joint military command said that Iraqi forces, aided by American airstrikes, had retaken 60 percent of Ramadi. But Iraqi forces have yet to cross the river into the city center, where the real urban combat is expected to take place.Iraqi forces have dropped leaflets on Ramadi urging residents to flee via the south.Ramadi fell to the Islamic State in May after Iraqi forces withdrew en masse, an embarrassment that caused Mr. Carter to openly question their will to fight. In July, Iraqi forces began the slow grind to retake the city, and they have worked to isolate and cordon it off since.Retaking the Sunni heartland city is viewed as a key to the administration's efforts to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.""There is some risk in using attack helicopters,"" said a senior Defense Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""But it is one that we're willing to do because we think it's important to help finish the fighting in Ramadi. It's going to take time, but we're willing to do that next step.""Pentagon officials said that the United States was pushing its allies in Europe and the Persian Gulf to provide more than just attack aircraft in the fight against the Islamic State, specifically looking for them to provide Special Operations troops in Syria, as well as security training for moderate forces fighting the Islamic State.""We're asking them to step it up in our efforts in Syria, in particular,"" the official said.During the hearing, Mr. Carter expressed frustration with Sunni Arab allies who he said could do more to help with the effort against the Islamic State. ""I, too, wish that particularly the Sunni Arab nations of the gulf would do more,"" Mr. Carter said.Pentagon officials attributed the recent Iraqi successes in Ramadi to new equipment provided by the United States and a shift in training to emphasize combat engineering rather than counterinsurgency.During the hearing, Mr. Carter got into the usual back and forth with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has pushed for more American troops to be sent to fight the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.""There are 20,000 to 30,000 of them,"" Mr. McCain said. ""They are not giants. Somebody is going to have to convince me that air power alone"" is enough to defeat the militant Sunni extremist group.Mr. Carter countered that a large American deployment could do more harm that good. ""By seeming to Americanize the conflicts in Iraq and Syria,"" he said, ""we could well turn those fighting ISIL or inclined to resist their rule into fighting us instead.""Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.Photograph A Member of the Iraqi Security Forces On Monday Near Ramadi, Where the Army has Been Advancing On Islamic State Militants.

U.S. Cautious on Iran Missile Test Claim:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is facing another difficult choice with Iran: As Tehran takes apart much of its nuclear infrastructure to win sanctions relief, how vocally should the White House condemn Iranian violations of United Nations resolutions on other issues?Based on the first responses Tuesday to reports that Iran had conducted yet another launch of a medium-range ballistic missile, the answer appears to be not very loudly.Samantha Power, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said that Washington was ""conducting a serious review of the reported incident."" She said that if the review determined that the test occurred, the United States would take the issue up with the Security Council.American officials did announce some sanctions on Tuesday for ballistic missile tests -- but they were against North Korea, for violating Security Council resolutions by launching short- and medium-range missiles in tests last year.Before the Iran nuclear accord, the White House regularly condemned Tehran's tests. But now, officials say privately, they believe that the tests may be the work of angry elements in Iran's military who hope to derail the nuclear accord and preserve their atomic infrastructure.""We're seeing a lot of infighting within Iran now,"" one senior American official said.Outside analysts seemed to have little doubt about what the Iranians launched on Nov. 21: a Ghadr-110, a version of the country's Shahab-3 missile. That missile figured in the nuclear negotiations, because of evidence that Iran had conducted studies about how to shrink a nuclear device to fit into the Shahab's nose cone.The November test, if confirmed, would be a clear violation of Security Council Resolution 1929, which remains in force until the nuclear accord goes into effect -- probably in January. After that, a new Security Council resolution will take effect, in which Iran is ""called upon"" to stop work for eight years on any ballistic missiles that could deliver a nuclear weapon. But the test would not violate the nuclear accord itself.Nonetheless, the administration's cautious response drew criticism from Republicans and even some Democrats who voted in favor of the nuclear accord.""Ignoring violations of the agreement will send a troubling signal to not only Iran, but our allies in the region about our commitment to vigorously enforcing its restrictions,"" Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, Democrat of Massachusetts, said after writing a letter to President Obama with Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida.Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said in a speech on Sunday that there should be no tolerance for small violations of the nuclear agreement. Administration officials responded by noting that on the nuclear side of the agreement, Iran appears to be moving very fast to dismantle its infrastructure, in hopes of receiving over $100 billion in sanctions relief before a major national election in the spring.Separately, the United States and its European allies began circulating a draft on Tuesday of a resolution at the International Atomic Energy Agency that would close the inquiry into ""possible military dimensions"" of Iran's nuclear program, after the publication last week of a report by the agency. That report suggested such work had been intense through 2003 and continued sporadically until 2009.",1.0
Middle East; Yemen: 3 Detained Americans Are Allowed to Leave:   [Brief ],,"Three Americans have been flown out of Yemen to Oman, the Omani Foreign Ministry said Thursday, according to a report by the state-run Oman News Agency.

The brief statement gave no details about the identities of the Americans, but a Yemeni security official said the men had been detained by the rebels. ""The three Americans were detained by the security forces run by the Houthis and were held on suspicion of spying,"" the official said. The rebels, who ousted Yemen's internationally recognized government this year, have been pummeled by a military campaign led by Saudi Arabia and backed by the United States.",1.0
Questions After Strikes on Stronghold in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- First France and then Russia answered Islamic State attacks on their citizens with a strategy of direct reprisal: intensified airstrike campaigns on Raqqa, the militants' de facto capital within Syria, meant to eliminate the group's leadership and resources.But on Tuesday in the early hours of those new campaigns, there seemed to be more questions than decisive results. Chief among them: Why, if there were confirmed Islamic State targets that could be hit without killing civilians, were they not hit more heavily long ago? And what, in fact, was being hit?More broadly, the Raqqa airstrikes are renewing a debate about how effective such attacks can be in defeating or containing the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, without more commitment to measures like drying up its financial support, combating its ideology or -- what outside forces on all sides so far appear to have ruled out -- conducting a ground assault.Several people in Lebanon, Syria and Turkey who have been able to make contact with relatives in Raqqa say the recent French airstrikes -- a barrage of about 30 on Sunday night and seven more on Monday -- did not kill any civilians. But neither did they inflict serious military damage, those people said, instead hitting empty areas or buildings, or parts of the territory of factory complexes or military bases used by the Islamic State.Abdullah, a Syrian concierge in Beirut who reached his sister in Raqqa on Tuesday, said that in the case of the seven French airstrikes on Monday, ""all these strikes are targeting abandoned empty locations."" The day before, he said, the 30 French airstrikes hit mainly the outskirts of the city. ""Thank God, no civilians died,"" he said.The activist group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, which opposes both the Islamic State and the Syrian government, also insisted that no civilians had been killed in the French barrages. It had yet to post information about the Russian airstrikes that took place on Tuesday, lacking more recent updates.More French airstrikes, reaching 25 to 30, struck Raqqa late Tuesday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group in Britain that has a network of contacts in Syria. Many of the strikes hit deserted areas that had already been struck, but casualties were reported in addition to property damage, the group said.In a statement, the French Defense Ministry said that the fighter jets had taken off from Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, and that the strikes had destroyed two Islamic State command centers in Raqqa.Although the United States has conducted spot strikes within Raqqa, like the one said to have killed the Islamic State media figure known as Jihadi John, American officials say concern about the large civilian population remaining in the city has precluded heavier bombing. And even under the current rules of engagement, Syrians have reported numerous instances of civilian casualties from American airstrikes, including one in May in the town of Bir Mahli that killed at least 60 people.Many of the group's command posts in Raqqa were identified long ago, but they are in places that get heavy civilian traffic or where the Islamic State is holding civilian prisoners, like the main security office known as Point 11, inside a soccer stadium.Despite its importance as an Islamic State operational center, Raqqa has remained much more intact than Syrian cities like Homs and Aleppo, where the Syrian government has focused its efforts to eliminate rebel groups. Over the past year, though, government bombardments of the city have become more frequent, sometimes hitting schools and other civilian infrastructure, residents say.Still, even in recent months, people have fled to Raqqa from places they perceive as more dangerous. Numerous residents have moved there from Palmyra, recently taken by the Islamic State and newly coming under government airstrikes.Outside of anecdotal accounts, damage assessment in Raqqa is inherently difficult. Islamic State fighters over the past several months have been closing Internet cafes and monitoring the remaining ones more closely, making it difficult for residents to reach the outside world and to speak freely when they do. Talking to journalists is particularly risky, as was demonstrated in dramatic fashion by the murder in southern Turkey of two activists for Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently.A Syrian government supporter from Raqqa who now lives in Beirut, Lebanon, and describes himself as a kind of freelance informant for government forces, said there had long been airstrikes in or around Raqqa nearly every day. Sometimes they are executed by Syrian warplanes, other times by the American-led coalition and more recently by Russia, the informant said, using only a nickname, Shadi, to protect family members still in Raqqa. But he added: ""They don't have too much impact on ISIS's military situation.""Instead, the strikes within Raqqa have hurt locals at least as much as the Islamic State fighters who live among them, he said. In the airstrikes that have hit crowded city areas, ""one Daesh member gets killed, and 10 civilians,"" he said, using an Arabic acronym for the group.And while strikes are sometimes reported to have hit Islamic State military bases, Shadi said such strikes may sound more significant than they really were, because the bases are large and open and can get hit without doing any real damage.Despite his allegiance to the Syrian government, Shadi said that as a practical matter government airstrikes tended to hit less precisely, whereas American ones had sometimes been accurate enough to kill Islamic State commanders in their cars.Earlier Russian airstrikes in Syria, including a few on Raqqa but also in other parts, had not proved much better than the government ones, because, he said, Russians lacked ""people on the ground.""Also complicating the international effort is the disagreement between Russia and the United States over whom and what to target. Russia insists that there is little distinction between the Islamic State and other insurgent groups, like the Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front and some American-backed factions. The United States insists that the focus should be on the Islamic State, and that some other insurgent groups are legitimate opposition forces.That lingering dispute was on display on Tuesday as Russian missile strikes hit the provinces of Idlib and Aleppo farther west, in areas where the Islamic State has no known territory. In the town of Atareb, according to local insurgents, a group that has been battling the Islamic State and receiving American support was hit.The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington research group that has advocated more robust American intervention in Syria, recently called for a loosening of the rules of engagement for United States warplanes -- in other words, a relaxing of efforts to avoid killing civilians.Shadi and other Raqqa residents said that -- aside from the moral objections -- such a plan made little sense: Islamic State fighters in Raqqa seem more concerned about the ground offensive being prepared by Kurdish militias that have received American support.Shadi said the fighters had been pressuring males as young as 15 to join them to ""fight the Kurds"" and, if they refuse, imposing a ""tax"" to be used to buy a weapon for a fighter.""They are facing death every day,"" Shadi said of residents, adding that many families had sent a member to join the Islamic State because they need money or protection against the group.The Raqqa activists insisted there were no civilian casualties in the French airstrikes, and said in a Twitter post that they would not withhold such information.""Our group will be the first who will report about any civilians who will be killed or injured by any Airstrikes, whether this Airstrikes by Coalition or #France or #USA or #Russia"" or by the Syrian Army, ""so please stop Publishing lies.""They added: ""of course we don't like to see people afraid from the Airstrikes and Explosion but we support any action will take #ISIS out from #Raqqa.""At the same time, they posted maps from Google Earth of the areas where they said some of the strikes had hit -- some of which are in open areas and some of which have been abandoned.The activists said that despite the fear, some residents enjoyed a few moments of freedom when fighters took cover during airstrikes, especially women who step out on their balconies without worrying that the fighters will order them to cover up.",1.0
Russia Allies With France Against ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- Russia on Tuesday said that it was coordinating with the French military in sharply ratcheting up attacks on Syrian territory, especially areas held by the Islamic State, as the government for the first time acknowledged that a bomb had destroyed a Russian charter jet that crashed more than two weeks ago in Egypt.In a related move, President Obama said early Wednesday that he was open to cooperating with Russia in the campaign against the Islamic State, which has asserted responsibility for destroying the charter plane and for the deadly attacks in Paris on Friday, but only if the government of President Vladimir V. Putin begins targeting the militant group.The timing of the Kremlin's announcement on Tuesday, after France had already begun striking Islamic State targets and had called for a united front against the group, suggested that Russia was using the moment to help repair frayed relations with the West.The Kremlin also announced that Mr. Putin and his French counterpart, François Hollande, had spoken by telephone, had agreed to coordinate military attacks in Syria and would meet on Nov. 26 in Moscow.In a military briefing for Mr. Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, which was televised live nationwide, it was announced that Russia had deployed cruise missiles, long-range bombers and other warplanes.""A massive airstrike is targeting ISIL sites in Syrian territory,"" Mr. Shoigu said, using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State. ""The number of sorties has been doubled, which makes it possible to deliver powerful pinpoint strikes upon ISIL fighters all throughout the Syrian territory.""Mr. Putin and his defense chief were shown sitting in a three-story military command center with a map of Syria the size of a movie screen on one wall. In a scene that could have been lifted from a James Bond film, scores of military men, many wearing headsets, were lined up in desks on the main floor and overhead balconies, all facing the screen.A pariah in Western leadership circles since his invasion of Crimea last year and his support of separatists in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin was suddenly front and center at the Group of 20 summit meeting this week in Antalya, Turkey. For Mr. Putin, ending the diplomatic isolation could be an important first step in persuading the West to lift sanctions on his wobbly economy imposed because of the Ukraine dispute.Speaking after a meeting with President Benigno S. Aquino III of the Philippines, Mr. Obama, who was in Manila for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting, said he had had ""repeated discussions"" with Mr. Putin about the two militaries working more closely together.""The problem has been in their initial military incursion into Syria, they have been more focused on propping up President Assad,"" Mr. Obama said, adding that ""If in fact he shifts his focus and the focus of his military, to what is the principle threat, which is ISIL, then that is what we want to see.""Mr. Obama's comments are the most direct indication that the United States is prepared to work with Russia to counter the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.The president suggested that American officials remained skeptical about whether Mr. Putin would shift his focus toward the terrorist group, even in the wake of the Paris attacks.But he said that the Russians have been ""a constructive partner"" during diplomatic talks in Vienna last week, where foreign ministers agreed to a path to a cease-fire in Syria and an eventual political transition.Mr. Obama added that there was a ""catch"" to that cooperative spirit, saying that ""Moscow is still interested in keeping Assad in power.""He said, however, that ""those differences have not prevented us at looking at how could we set up a cease-fire.""Alexander V. Bortnikov, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service, said investigators estimated that the bomb that brought down the Metrojet Airbus A321, killing all 224 people aboard, was made of up to 1 kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of TNT. He added that ""foreign made"" explosive material had been found in the wreckage.In remarks to Russia's Security Council on Monday and broadcast on Tuesday morning, he said that ""we can say definitely that this was a terrorist act.""An ""improvised explosive device"" detonated soon after the plane took off, Mr. Bortnikov said, adding that ""the plane disintegrated in midair, which explains the widely scattered fuselage pieces.""Egyptian officials have repeatedly asserted that it was premature to conclude that an act of sabotage had destroyed the Russian jetliner, with some saying such an explanation was part of an international conspiracy against their country. But Egypt's position has become harder to maintain in recent days as the Russian government, one of its closest allies, gave increasing indications that it believed a bomb was the most likely cause. The Russians moved to sever almost all air connections with Egypt.The plane crashed minutes after departing Sharm el Sheikh, a Red Sea resort now reeling from a loss of the tourism. Russia's confirmation that the plane was felled by a bomb -- presumably smuggled through the Sharm el Sheikh airport -- could further weaken Egypt's vital tourism industry, and undermines government claims of progress in vanquishing militants based in Sinai.On Tuesday, after hours of silence following the Russian announcement, Egyptian officials seemed to be gingerly walking back their denials. Egypt's civil aviation minister said the committee investigating the crash had ""not arrived at any criminal evidence,"" but a statement from the Interior Ministry included the possibility of a ""terrorist attack,"" while announcing enhanced security measures at airports.""This is the first time that the Egyptian authorities admit the possibility that whatever happened to the Russian plane was a terrorist attack,"" said Mustapha Kamel al-Sayyid, a political science professor at Cairo University and the American University in Cairo. While the change was ""not easy"" for the Egyptian government, he said, it appeared to reflect an attempt to avoid a rift with the Russians.The Russians did not acknowledge that the Islamic State had planted the bomb. But the Russian attacks that followed on parts of Syria held by the Islamic State, presented in the live television briefing, left no doubt that the Russians were intent on showing they blamed the group.Russia fired 34 cruise missiles from the eastern Mediterranean, hitting more than a dozen targets in Aleppo and Idlib, said Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the Russian military's chief of staff.Military aircraft, including long-range bombers flying from Russia, flew 127 sorties, hitting 266 targets and destroying 140, the defense minister said. The Russian Air Force deployed in Syria has flown almost 2,300 combat missions since the attacks started 48 days ago, General Gerasimov said.""We will search for them everywhere, no matter where they are hiding,"" Mr. Putin said at a meeting with his security council broadcast on television. ""We will find them in any place on the planet and will punish them.""Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

U.S. Airstrikes Destroy Scores of ISIS Oil Trucks in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Intensifying pressure on the Islamic State, United States warplanes for the first time attacked hundreds of trucks on Monday that the extremist group has been using to smuggle the crude oil it has been producing in Syria, American officials said.According to an initial assessment, 116 trucks were destroyed in the attack, which took place near Deir al-Zour, an area in eastern Syria that is controlled by the Islamic State.The airstrikes were carried out by four A-10 attack planes and two AC-130 gunships based in Turkey.Plans for the strike were developed well before the terrorist attacks in and around Paris on Friday, officials familiar with the operation said, part of a broader operation to disrupt the ability of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, to generate revenue to support its military operations and govern its territory.American officials have long been frustrated by the ability of the Islamic State to generate tens of million of dollars a month by producing and exporting oil.To disrupt that revenue source, American officials said last week that the United States had sharply stepped up its airstrikes against infrastructure that allows the Islamic State to pump oil in Syria.Until Monday, the United States refrained from striking the fleet used to transport oil, believed to include more than 1,000 tanker trucks, because of concerns about causing civilian casualties. As a result, the Islamic State's distribution system for exporting oil had remained largely intact.The new campaign is called Tidal Wave II. It is named after the World War II effort to counter Nazi Germany by striking Romania's oil industry. Lt. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who in September assumed command of the international coalition's campaign in Iraq and Syria, suggested the name.To reduce the risk of harming civilians, two F-15 warplanes dropped leaflets about an hour before the attack warning drivers to abandon their vehicles, and strafing runs were conducted to reinforce the message.The area where the trucks assemble in Syria has been closely monitored by reconnaissance drones. As many as 1,000 trucks have been observed there, waiting to receive their cargo of illicit oil.On Monday, 295 trucks were in the area, and more than a third of them were destroyed, United States officials said. The A-10s dropped two dozen 500-pound bombs and conducted strafing runs with 30-millimeter Gatling guns. The AC-130s attacked with 30-millimeter Gatling guns and 105-millimeter cannons.The pilots saw several drivers running to a nearby tent and did not attack them, an American official said, and there were no immediate reports of civilian casualties.Col. Steven H. Warren, the American-led coalition's spokesman in Baghdad, confirmed that A-10s and AC-130s had been used in the attack and that 116 tanker trucks had been destroyed.""This part of Tidal Wave II is designed to attack the distribution component of ISIL's oil smuggling operation and degrade their capacity to fund their military operations,"" Colonel Warren said.The strike came just days after Kurdish and Yazidi fighters, backed by American airstrikes, cut an important road, Highway 47, that the Islamic State has used to move supplies and fighters between Syria and Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, which was captured by the militant group last year.That road was cut on Thursday, and Kurdish and Yazidi fighters retook the Iraqi city of Sinjar the next day.The American operation against the oil trucks followed a French raid on Sunday on two Islamic State targets in Raqqa, Syria, which allied officials identified as a headquarters building and a training camp.More than 20 bombs were dropped by French planes in the attack, an allied official said. It is not clear how much damage was caused, and no secondary explosions were observed.",1.0
Russia and Turkey Trade Insults Amid a Deepening Feud:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- The leaders of Turkey and Russia flung insults at each other on Thursday in their deepening feud over the shooting down of a Russian warplane, with President Vladimir V. Putin warning that Moscow would do more than merely ban tomatoes and construction projects to penalize Ankara.The Kremlin also said that the long-delayed transfer of the S-300 air defense system to Iran had started, a move that strengthens one of Turkey's regional rivals while raising concerns in Israel.The foreign ministers of Russia and Turkey met on Thursday in Belgrade, Serbia, on the sidelines of a conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Given the general mood in the ministers' home countries, however, the tension persisted.In Moscow, Mr. Putin, delivering his annual speech on the state of the federation, opened by repeating his call for an international coalition to fight terrorism and then suggested that the Turkish leadership was deranged. For his part, the Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, accused the Kremlin on Thursday of practicing a crude, ""Soviet-style propaganda.""Mr. Putin said that there was no need for Turkey to have shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 warplane on Nov. 24, which Ankara accused of violating its airspace but Moscow maintains was over Syria.""Allah only knows why they did it,"" Mr. Putin told a vast assembly of the Russian political elite gathered in the hall of St. George, a majestic white marble room in the Kremlin. The audience included the widows of the pilot and of another serviceman killed in the episode. ""Probably, Allah decided to punish Turkey's ruling clique by depriving it of sense and reason,"" Mr. Putin said.The Russian president said that his country's response to the attack would be measured and would avoid military threats, but that it would extend beyond the clamping down on tourism, the limited economic sanctions on agricultural products and the canceling of labor contracts already announced.""If they expected a nervous or hysterical reaction from us, if they wanted to see us become a danger to ourselves as much as to the world, they won't get it,"" Mr. Putin said. ""We are not going to rattle the saber.""Mr. Putin did, however, threaten further, unspecified actions beyond the scattered measures already announced.""If someone thinks they can commit war crimes, kill our people and get away with it, suffering nothing but a ban on tomato imports, as well as a few restrictions in construction or other industries, they're delusional,"" he said.Alexander Novak, the energy minister, announced soon after the speech that Moscow was halting talks with Ankara over the Turkish Stream gas pipeline, a $10 billion construction project meant to funnel Russian gas to Europe.Mr. Putin repeated the accusation, laid out the day before in a lengthy briefing by the Russian Ministry of Defense, that the governing Turkish elite, including the family of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was earning a fortune from oil exported by the Islamic State from Syria and Iraq.The ministry offered an exceedingly rare invitation to foreign journalists to enter its headquarters to view a series of satellite photographs showing lines of hundreds of trucks close to oil facilities and also lining up near the Turkish border.Those allegations were dismissed by Mr. Davutoglu, who said that Turkey was working to seal its border with Syria.""In the Cold War period, there was a Soviet propaganda machine,"" he told reporters in Ankara. ""Every day it created different lies. They would believe them and then expect the world to believe them.""Calling the accusations ""nonsense,"" Mr. Davutoglu added, ""This was an old tradition, but it has suddenly reared its head again.""Although the United States has expressed frustration with the Turks for not doing more to control a roughly 100-mile stretch of border that faces territory controlled by the Islamic State, Washington has rejected the accusation that Ankara is acting in league with the militants.In Belgrade, no change emerged from the 40-minute meeting between the Russian and Turkish foreign ministers, the first high-level talks in person between the two countries since the downing of the warplane.""We haven't heard anything new,"" Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said during a news conference broadcast live in Russia. Both sides stuck to their previous positions, he said.The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said after the meeting that the fight against the Islamic State should not get entangled with what he called the ""accident"" of shooting down the plane.""Foreign militants, extremists, radicalization -- these are the subjects we must focus on,"" he was quoted as saying by Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency.Russia has vowed to prevent any further attacks on its aircraft, including dispatching to Syria its powerful S-400 air defense system, which has a range of almost 250 miles.The delivery of the S-300 air defense system to Iran fulfills a contract that was delayed for years during the international confrontation with Tehran over its nuclear program. The deal was signed in 2007, suspended in 2010 and reinstated last spring.The state-run Russian news agency Tass quoted Vladimir Kozhin, the top Kremlin official responsible for military-technical cooperation, as saying the missiles were being transferred. ""The contract is in action; they've begun,"" Mr. Kozhin was quoted as saying, with no further details.Among other countries, Israel had previously expressed concern about the delivery. The S-300 missiles would render any air attack on Iran's nuclear facilities far more difficult.Analysts linked the delivery to the situation in Syria, where British warplanes on Thursday joined the United States-led coalition's bombing campaign. Tehran and Moscow back President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, while the coalition, which includes Turkey, supports the opposition and would like to see Mr. Assad gone.""Turkey is the main opponent to Russia and Iran in Syria, therefore these deliveries are connected with the overall situation in the region,"" said Alexander Golts, a columnist in Moscow, noting that the Russian Air Force was supporting Iran's ground operations in Syria.""It is more or less clear that Iran is becoming Russia's significant ally,"" Mr. Golts said. ""Therefore the Kremlin is absolutely willing to fulfill its obligations to it in full.""Although Mr. Putin spent most of his speech on internal issues, he repeated his recent call for an international coalition to fight terrorism and said Russia was mobilizing domestically against extremism.He spoke a day after the Islamic State released a grisly video of what it called a Russian spy having his throat cut by a fellow Russian fighting for the Islamic State. The executioner said Russian forces in the Middle East would be defeated and threatened to carry out attacks in Moscow like those in Paris on Nov. 13.Ramzan A. Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, confirmed that the murdered man was from his republic and vowed that the executioner would soon perish.""Chechens remember, they know, and they will not leave it unpunished,"" Mr. Kadyrov said on Thursday, speaking to reporters in the Kremlin after Mr. Putin's speech. ""Anyone who has slaughtered one of our citizens and threatens the safety of our country will not live long. We will send him to glory with a one-way ticket.""Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

Bombed Clinic Says Coalition Knew Location:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- A military coalition led by Saudi Arabia that bombed a Doctors Without Borders clinic in Yemen on Wednesday had regularly been provided with the coordinates of the clinic, the medical charity said in a statement on Thursday.The airstrikes on the clinic, in the war-torn southern city of Taiz, wounded nine people, including two Doctors Without Borders staff members, the organization said. The coordinates of the clinic had been given to Saudi officials most recently on Nov. 29, it said.""There is no way that the Saudi-led coalition could have been unaware of the presence of M.S.F. activities in this location,"" Jerome Alin, the Yemeni director for Doctors Without Borders, said in the statement, using the initials of the organization's French name, Médecins Sans Frontières. The group had also contacted the coalition shortly before the attack, when airstrikes in a nearby park appeared to threaten the clinic.The bombings on Wednesday were the second attack by the Saudi-led coalition on a Doctors Without Borders medical site in Yemen in less than two months, and the group's medical facitilties have been hit in other war zones, including in Afghanistan and Syria. In late October, the Saudi-led coalition destroyed a hospital in Yemen's northern Haydan district, near the border with Saudi Arabia.A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition did not answer calls seeking comment on the latest attack.The coalition aerial campaign began in March as a way to defeat the Houthi rebels who had captured territory across Yemen. Nine months later, the Houthis remain in control of large parts of the country and more than 2,500 civilians have been killed in the war, most of them, by coalition airstrikes, according to the United Nations and human rights groups.A report last week by the Human Rights Watch that looked at 10 airstrikes across Yemen by the Saudi-led coalition from April through August found that the attacks were not aimed at military targets, or else ""failed to distinguish civilians from military objectives,"" and most likely amounted to violations of international humanitarian law. The strikes killed at least 309 civilians, said the group, which is based in New York.Human Rights Watch said that the United States, which has supported the Saudi-led coalition, was also a ""party to the conflict by playing a direct role in coordinating military operations"" and might be party to violations of the laws of war by the coalition.The group cited statements by the commander of the Air Force Central Command, Lt. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., saying that the United States had detached personnel to a center in Saudi Arabia where the airstrikes were planned.Doctors Without Borders, citing local sources, said it evacuated its tented clinic after several airstrikes hit a park nearby around 11 a.m. on Wednesday. The group said it notified the Saudi-led coalition that their ""jet planes were mounting an attack nearby."" Then, the clinic came under attack, the group said.Few hospitals are functioning in Taiz, which has been blockaded by the Houthis for months and has been the scene of the some of the fiercest fighting in the war. Doctors Without Borders said that the clinic that was struck, in the Houban district, had treated 408 patients in the two days before the airstrikes.",1.0
C.I.A.-Trained Forces in Afghanistan Scrutinized After Civilian Deaths:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- A series of home raids by C.I.A.-trained Afghan counterterrorism forces in the last month resulted in the deaths of at least six innocent civilians, according to Afghan government officials, reviving an issue that has been a chronic source of tension between Afghanistan and the United States.The deaths happened over the course of three raids in the restive eastern province of Khost, the officials said, including a Nov. 20 episode in which a husband and wife were killed with two American advisers present. The raids were conducted by the Khost Protection Force, one of the regional units known as counterterrorism pursuit teams, set up by the C.I.A. to fight the Taliban, the Haqqani network and Al Qaeda.The C.I.A. has trained thousands of Afghan forces for such missions -- around 3,500 in the Khost Protection Force alone. But from the start, some senior Afghan officials have considered them a problem, accused of human rights abuses and seen as largely unaccountable.The C.I.A. began dismantling or shrinking the teams as the agency began a partial withdrawal from Afghanistan in recent years. And control of the pursuit teams was officially shifted to the Afghan intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, from the C.I.A. two years ago, at the request of Afghan officials.But some now say the remaining Afghan counterterrorism forces are still largely unaccountable to the government.One former senior Afghan government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence issues, said that the transfer of authority in some cases had not been completed. ""The main problem is that there are a number of people working for the C.I.A. who will not work for the Afghan armed forces,"" the former official said.There are also concerns about former members of the teams who were paid a $2,000 severance and dismissed by the C.I.A. ""That could cause problems for us in the future,"" the former official said, particularly if those highly trained people were to end up on the wrong side of the law.The National Security Directorate did not reply to requests for comment, and officials in the office of President Ashraf Ghani did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Wednesday. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment.One American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a classified security force, defended the Khost pursuit team as ""one of the most effective elements fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.""The official added, ""This is a group made up of thousands of soldiers who come from the area and consequently have the respect and insights necessary to operate in a professional manner despite the constant engagement with the enemy.""Khost has long been a critical battlefield, as it is a strategic gateway for Taliban and the Haqqani network to bring fighters into Afghanistan from their havens in the Pakistani tribal areas across the border. It is also a crucial corridor to Kabul, and American and Afghan officials have long felt that gains by the Taliban there could pose a threat to the capital.In the latest militant attack in Khost, a roadside bomb attack on Wednesday apparently aimed at Habib Khan Taniwal, a member of the provincial council, killed two people and wounded seven others, including three of his bodyguards, officials in the province said. Mr. Taniwal survived.The first Khost Protection Force raid under scrutiny happened on Nov. 7 in the Dery neighborhood of the provincial capital, Khost City. Operatives arrived in pickup trucks and raided a home there, killing a 45-year-old man and his 17-year-old nephew -- both described as innocent civilians by Abdul Wahed Patan, deputy to the Khost governor.About 1,000 people protested those killings, trying to carry the bodies of the two victims to the regional capital, according to people who participated in the demonstrations. They were stopped en route by the counterterrorism force and told to go back or face a possible assault by American troops, they said. The protesters went home.In another raid in Khost City, on Nov. 11, a 50-year-old man and his 26-year-old son were wrongfully killed, according to Mr. Patan and the district governor, Jawid Joshan.In the Nov. 20 raids, the Khost force, accompanied by two American advisers, arrived by helicopter around 1:30 a.m., dismounted and raided three houses in the district of Zazi Maidan, according to General Azizullah, the district police chief.One of the houses belonged to a recently discharged Afghan Army soldier named Ibrahim Jan. Neighbors said that Mr. Jan had heard noises and ran outside with his assault rifle to protect his family. Members of the counterterrorism force had climbed onto his roof, and shot and killed him before he fired. When his wife ran out to him, they gunned her down, too, the neighbors said.It is not unusual for Afghans to be armed, and the police in Khost have often allowed some at-risk people to carry weapons for personal protection. As a former soldier, Mr. Jan would most likely have feared being singled out as a target by the Taliban.At another house in Zazi Maidan, belonging to a man named Mia Gul, the Khost Protection Force seized weapons and detained two men, Mr. Gul and his brother Rahmat Gul, and took them to the Camp Chapman base nearby, local officials said. Mia Gul was released the next morning, but Rahmat Gul remains in custody.Home raids have long been a source of outrage -- and civilian casualties -- for Afghans, and in 2013 American commanders sharply limited them at the demand of former President Hamid Karzai.But even after the formal end of the NATO combat mission last year, such raids have again become common. American officials have described them as a crucial weapon against militants, but the raids are still a source of concern when they come to light.""As long as the so-called U.S. war on terror is unwisely conducted in the Afghan villages and towns, there will certainly be civilian casualties,"" said Aimal Faizi, who served as spokesman to Mr. Karzai and has been a critic of Mr. Ghani's government.""It is the responsibility of the Afghan government to protect its citizens,"" he added, ""but the national unity government seems to be disregarding cases of civilian casualties in Afghanistan involving U.S. forces.""Ashley Jackson, a former United Nations official in Kabul and now a research associate at the Overseas Development Institute in London, said that with the transition to Afghan-led forces, the actions of shadowy units like the counterterrorism pursuit teams are harder to examine. ""There's less and less accountability,"" she said. ""There's less Western focus, and fewer people care.""Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: Asian Morning newsletter.

British Jets Hit ISIS in Syria After Parliament Authorizes Strikes:   [Foreign Desk ],,"LONDON -- The British Parliament on Wednesday authorized airstrikes in Syria against the Islamic State, in a vote that became a wider test of British willingness to play an active role in international affairs, and British warplanes made their first attacks hours later.Early on Thursday, the Defense Ministry said that four Tornado jets took off from the Akrotiri Royal Air Force Base in Cyprus and returned to base safely after carrying out airstrikes, according to British news reports. The ministry did not provide specific details of the airstrikes.The vote, after months of wrangling, hand-wringing and a daylong parliamentary debate, underscored the concerted efforts of Prime Minister David Cameron, whose Conservative Party has a majority in Parliament, to restore Britain's reputation as a serious global actor.""The threat is very real,"" Mr. Cameron said of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, on Wednesday, as he opened the debate in the House of Commons. ""The question is this: Do we work with our allies to degrade and destroy this threat?""In the end, British lawmakers opted to try to do so, voting by 397 to 223 to go along with Mr. Cameron's plan, despite some forceful speeches against the strikes.The run-up to the vote also amounted to a low point for Jeremy Corbyn, the new leader of the opposition Labour Party. While Mr. Corbyn opposes British military action over Syria, some of Labour's senior figures, including the party's spokesman on foreign affairs, Hilary Benn, supported it, and Mr. Corbyn was forced to allow his lawmakers to vote freely on the issue in an effort to avoid a intraparty clash amid threatened resignations.In an impassioned speech that won a rousing reception Wednesday night, Mr. Benn argued that ""every state has the right to defend itself"" and asked ""why would we not uphold the settled will of the United Nations?""His contribution to the debate appeared to have helped Mr. Cameron secure the ""clear majority"" in the parliamentary vote that he said he was seeking.While there are serious questions about the extent to which British airstrikes would make a difference in the fight against the Islamic State -- the military is already conducting strikes against the militants in Iraq -- the issue has always been more about alliance solidarity and leadership than about strict military or strategic utility.""It will not make a big operational difference,"" said Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute, a research organization specializing in security.""It is important symbolically, useful operationally, but not transformative,"" he said. ""A willingness to deploy will allay the concern that the U.K. is not a reliable partner.""In his first term, as head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, Mr. Cameron earned a reputation for lack of interest in foreign policy that seemed to contradict Britain's history, or its status as a nuclear power and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.After Britain joined France's military intervention in 2011, with NATO support, to overthrow Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, resulting in considerable chaos in North Africa, Mr. Cameron appeared to pull back from military action.While France fought Islamic radicals in Mali, bombed the Islamic State in Syria and made a diplomatic push seeking to resolve the Ukraine crisis with Russia, Mr. Cameron lost a parliamentary vote in 2013 seeking to authorize military action against President Bashar al-Assad of Syria for his use of chemical weapons.And despite hosting the 2014 NATO summit meeting in Wales, where he led pledges to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on the military, Mr. Cameron was reluctant to follow through, citing a need to reduce Britain's national deficit. The failure to honor the 2 percent commitment caused enormous friction with the Obama administration, and regular American demands -- quietly in public but very loudly in private -- that Britain keep its word.After winning a surprising but narrow majority in the general election in May, however, Mr. Cameron moved to restore Britain's reputation on the global stage and to play a more visible role in foreign policy.He found the resources to commit to the 2 percent threshold, committed to buying F-35 fighter jets and maritime patrol planes for Britain's new aircraft carriers, and vowed to renew Britain's submarine-based nuclear deterrent. He is now seeking to follow through on his promise to expand airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.Mr. Cameron has announced an increase in military spending in real terms of 3 percent over the next four years, including for special forces, intelligence gathering and a doubling of Britain's drone fleet.Nevertheless, after the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, Britons remain wary about involvement in Syria, and Mr. Cameron has had to spend considerable effort cajoling lawmakers -- including in his own party -- to support him.""This is not 2003,"" Mr. Cameron said while opening the parliamentary debate on Wednesday. ""We must not use past mistakes as an excuse for indifference or inaction.""Britain's ""reputation as a serious world player was damaged by the defense cuts announced in 2010 and by the parliamentary vote to refuse military force in 2013,"" Mr. Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute said.For one former minister, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, ""symbolism is more important than the effect.""""We are already at war, and the Rubicon was crossed a long time ago,"" the former minister argued, referring to the air campaign in Iraq and adding that Mr. Cameron ""has found it very embarrassing that Britain is not at the top table.""Mr. Cameron has argued that British military action in Iraqi airspace alone makes no sense, as the Islamic State does not recognize the Iraq-Syria border and the militants have their headquarters in Syria.He has also said that further military action was necessary to stem terrorist acts like the ones that struck Paris on Nov. 13, leaving 130 dead, and that it would be an essential component of any diplomatic solution to the Syrian civil war, which has displaced up to half that country's population.Mr. Cameron also argued that airstrikes on Islamic State in Syria will not make Britain any more vulnerable.""If there is an attack on the U.K. in the coming weeks or months, there will be those who try to say it's happened because of our airstrikes,"" he said.

Lebanon Exchanges Prisoners With Qaeda Branch:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The Syrian branch of Al Qaeda on Tuesday released 16 Lebanese servicemen captured more than a year ago in a rare prisoner exchange brokered by Qatar that included a woman said to be a former wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of the Islamic State jihadist organization.Masked gunmen waving black flags and driving pickup trucks brought the servicemen, dressed in black and sporting long beards but apparently in good health, to the outskirts of the Lebanese town of Arsal, near the Syrian border, according to footage broadcast by Al Jazeera. After shaving and donning crisp uniforms, the men were driven to Beirut for an official celebration.The swap deal, which had fallen through before, only partially concluded a painful chapter in Lebanon's struggle with the civil war in neighboring Syria, which has flooded the small country with refugees and increased tensions among its political factions.It also highlighted the power of Qatar, a tiny but fabulously wealthy Persian Gulf state that backs armed groups in Syria seeking to topple the government. This was the latest example of Qatar's using its wealth and connections to Islamists and extremists in the Middle East to win the release of prisoners.The servicemen, who included members of the Lebanese Army and its General Security force, were among a group captured in August 2014 during a joint attack on Arsal by militants from the Islamic State and the Syrian affiliate of Al Qaeda, the Nusra Front. Both groups took prisoners.Eight of those captives were subsequently released. Two were killed in captivity by the Islamic State and two others by the Nusra Front. One other died of wounds sustained in the battle for the town.Tuesday's swap freed only the remaining 16 captives held by the Nusra Front. They were exchanged for 25 prisoners held by Lebanon, including 17 women and their children, according to a statement by the Qatari Foreign Ministry.The Nusra Front also handed over the remains of one of the servicemen it had killed, Mohammad Hamiyeh.Nine Lebanese servicemen are believed to still be captives of the Islamic State, an enemy of the Nusra Front that split with Al Qaeda in 2014.Several released soldiers told television interviewers that they had generally been well treated by the Nusra Front, and they expressed hope that their colleagues held by the Islamic State would be released soon.The Lebanese and Qatari governments did not identify the prisoners Lebanon had released, but a Lebanese security official said on the condition of anonymity because of government protocol that Saja al-Dulaimi, believed by Lebanese officials to be a former wife of the Islamic State leader, was among those released. Ms. Dulaimi was arrested last year while trying to enter Lebanon with forged documents.At the time, Iraqi officials denied that she had been married to Mr. Baghdadi.In a brief interview with Al Jazeera, Ms. Dulaimi said that she and Mr. Baghdadi had been divorced for six or seven years and that she hoped to return to Beirut and then go to Turkey. The Lebanese news media also reported the release of the wife of a Nusra Front leader.The captives' fates have transfixed Lebanon and fueled political wrangling at home amid a political stalemate that has left the country without a president for more than a year.In Beirut, the capital, where families of the captive servicemen had pitched tents and kept vigil to pressure the government to negotiate their release, citizens gathered to celebrate and welcome the freed men.",1.0
Pentagon Officials Say They'll Bolster Special Operations Force in Iraq:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon will expand its Special Operations force in Iraq as part of a ramped-up war effort against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter told a House hearing on Tuesday.Mr. Carter said that a specialized expeditionary American military force would be able to target Islamic State militants in Iraq and make targeted raids into Syria. ""These special operators will over time be able to conduct raids, free hostages, gather intelligence and capture ISIL leaders,"" Mr. Carter said, using an acronym for the Islamic State.Mr. Carter did not say precisely how many new forces would be added but said they would be more than 50. He also did not say where exactly they would be based in Iraq. A Defense Department official said on Tuesday that these would be new troops and not troops reassigned from other parts of Iraq.President Obama has already authorized the deployment up to 50 special operators in Syria to help organize Arab and Kurdish fighters there.""We are at war,"" Mr. Carter told the House Armed Services Committee. He appeared alongside General Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Mr. Carter's comments came at a testy hearing that featured familiar themes: Republican lawmakers complained that the Obama administration does not have a strategy for dealing with the rise of the Islamic State, and called for more American forces on the ground in both places, while Mr. Carter's carefully worded answers seemed to reflect the caution of his boss, who has been loath to send more troops to the region after more than a decade of war.Defense officials said the new special operators would work with Kurdish and Iraqi troops in Iraq, as well as possibly Syrian and Arab troops, during targeted raids in Syria. Mr. Carter called the new operators a ""standing force"" based in Iraq.""I think you can expect to see a slow ramp-up"" of American forces in Iraq and perhaps even Syria, a Defense Department official said Tuesday, speaking on grounds of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly. ""The consensus is there; it's just a question of how quickly the White House wants to move.""An American military official, who asked not to be identified because he was talking about confidential plans, said the new force would look to conduct raids against Islamic State leaders in Iraq and Syria -- what the Pentagon calls ""high-value targets."" In addition, they would help analyze intelligence, identify targets and collaborate with Iraq's special forces.The move appears to be one of a series of steps the Obama administration is taking to raise the pressure on the Islamic State without fundamentally altering its cautious strategy. It is a step that has long been proposed by some of the administration's conservative critics, who have also urged the administration to deploy advisers with Iraqi brigades and use American Apache helicopters.The president has resisted such moves, which could bring American forces into closer contact with Islamic State militants. Mr. Obama's backers say he is wary of taking over the fight from the Iraqis, who some officials argue must lead the effort to drive the Islamic State out of their own country.But after avoiding the war in Syria for four years now, Mr. Obama has, in recent weeks and amid a worsening crisis, deepened American involvement in the war there. In agreeing to send 50 special operators to Syria in October, Mr. Obama crossed a line that he had refused to step over, committing American ground forces inside Syria. Military officials say they expect the number of special operators in Syria to increase in the coming months.Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said the deployment of more troops was ""a belated step forward"" in a written statement. But he called it ""yet another reactive and incremental step, adding, ""A comprehensive strategy to defeat ISIL is totally absent, urgently needed and long overdue.""The American escalation has come as Russia has inserted itself into the multisided civil war to support President Bashar al-Assad, bombing opposition forces initially and then, eventually, Islamic State targets, after the militant group claimed credit for downing a Russian passenger jet over Egypt. The White House has since taken pains not to characterize any American ramp-up as a response to the Russian moves.Once intent on using only American air power to help local forces on the ground, Mr. Obama has now sent 3,500 American troops to Iraq, mostly to advise and train Iraqi troops.""And there will be more,"" Mr. Carter said.He said the United States would continue to increase its presence in Iraq. ""We've intensified the air campaign against ISIL's war-sustaining oil enterprise, a critical pillar"" of the group's financial infrastructure, he told the committee. General Dunford said attacks by the American-led coalition in the last month against the Islamic State had disrupted 43 percent of the group's revenue stream.Mr. Carter said the new special operators could help in Syria as well, alluding to the pursuit of high-value targets like Islamic State leaders. ""It puts everybody on notice in Syria.

Europe; Russia: Turkey Returns Pilot's Body:   [Brief ],,"The body of Lt. Col. Oleg A. Peshkov, the Russian Air Force pilot killed after his warplane was shot down by Turkey on Nov. 24, was returned to Russia on Monday. Turkey secured the release of his body from inside Syria, and it was flown from Ankara to a military airfield near Moscow, according to Russian news reports. Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu and Gen. Viktor N. Bondarev, the commander in chief of the Russian Air Force, met the plane. After his Sukhoi Su-24 bomber had been shot by a Turkish F-16, Colonel Peshkov parachuted from the plane and was killed by ground fire as he floated into Syrian territory. Turkey insisted that the plane had briefly violated its airspace, a claim Russia denied.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"North Korean Test of Submarine-Launched Missile Was Unsuccessful, South Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea conducted a rare test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile over the weekend, but it ended in failure, said a South Korean lawmaker who attended a closed-door parliamentary briefing by the National Intelligence Service on Monday.Joo Ho-young, a governing party lawmaker and chairman of the National Assembly's Intelligence Committee, cited officials from the intelligence service, the South's main spy agency, as saying that North Korea had conducted the test on Saturday off Wonsan, a port city east of Pyongyang, with its leader, Kim Jong-un, watching.But there was no sign that the missile was successfully ejected from the submarine and took off, Mr. Joo told reporters after the intelligence officials briefed his committee. No rocket trajectory was detected, and what appeared to be debris from a missile was later seen floating on the surface of the sea, he said.The intelligence service declined to comment on the closed-door parliamentary session.On Monday, Kim Min-seok, the main spokesman for the Defense Ministry of South Korea, declined to provide details, saying that information related to ""the North's launching of an S.L.B.M.,"" or submarine-launched ballistic missile, remained classified.""What we can say is that North Korea is continuing the development and testing of an S.L.B.M.,"" Mr. Kim said. ""It is a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions banning it from developing or testing ballistic missiles.""Fears in the South of North Korean missile threats have grown since May, when the North claimed that it had successfully test-fired such a weapon and released photographs of Mr. Kim observing a missile soaring out of the water.Some missile experts have since questioned the claim, however, saying that the photographs appeared to have been modified. They said the North was probably still many years away from developing a submarine-launched ballistic missile, which would present a hard-to-detect danger for its enemies in the region. But South Korean officials maintained that the North had successfully fired a submarine-launched missile, which flew nearly 500 feet before falling into the sea. They said they expected more such tests.As it vowed to counter the North's growing missile threat, South Korea said in June that it had successfully test-fired its first ballistic missile with a range great enough to hit any part of North Korea. The South's president, Park Geun-hye, was said to have watched that test.",1.0
Taiwan: Old Enemies Exchange Spies:   [Brief ],,"China and Taiwan have engaged in rare exchange of spies, the office of Taiwan's president announced on Monday. The exchange, while made public now, actually took place in mid-October, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense said in a statement. China released two officers from Taiwan's Bureau of Military Intelligence, and they were returned to Taiwan. The men, Chu Kung-hsun and Hsu Chang-kuo, had been arrested in Vietnam near the border with China in 2006 and given life sentences, which were later reduced to 20 years, according to the Taiwanese newspaper China Times, which first reported the exchange. A Chinese spy imprisoned in Taiwan, Li Zhihao, was given early parole as part of the exchange, Charles Chen, a spokesman for Taiwan's presidential office, said in a statement. The exchange of spies, Mr. Chen said, was a sign of improved relations between China and Taiwan.",1.0
"Kurds, Backed by U.S. Air Power, Open an Offensive Against ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"Latest updates: For the latest news on the battle for Sinjar, please click here.Kurdish forces aided by thousands of lightly armed Yazidi fighters began a long-awaited offensive early Thursday to reclaim Mount Sinjar and an accompanying town from the Islamic State, which seized the northern Iraqi territory last year and murdered, raped and enslaved thousands of Yazidis.United States-led coalition air forces pounded the area in preparation for the offensive, which also sought to cut a major jihadist supply line between Syria and the Iraqi city of Mosul.A statement from the security council of the Kurdish autonomous region in Iraq said that up to 7,500 Kurdish pesh merga fighters were moving on ""three fronts to cordon off Sinjar City, take control of ISIL's strategic supply routes, and establish a significant buffer zone to protect the city and its inhabitants from incoming artillery."" ISIL is an acronym for the Islamic State.""Coalition warplanes will provide close air support to pesh merga forces throughout the operation,"" the statement said.Describing the unfolding battle, Kurdish officials said that pesh merga forces had taken the village of Gabara, west of Sinjar, and had cut the highway between the city and Syria.As the campaign got underway, long columns of pesh merga vehicles, including pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and a small number of armored vehicles, snaked their way across Mount Sinjar as airstrikes boomed in the distance.Some of the fighters walked alongside the vehicles, headed for the front.The battle plan called for the pesh merga, joined by Yazidi forces, to sweep down from Mount Sinjar to attack fighters for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, on multiple fronts. Kurdish officials said there could be as many as 700 Islamic State fighters in and around Sinjar, including foreign jihadists.""We have made our plans, but not everything goes according to plan,"" Maj. Gen. Aziz Waisi, the commander of the Zeravani Force, which is leading one of the prongs of the Kurdish offensive, said earlier. ""It is war, we have a determined enemy and there are always surprises from ISIS.""The operation, which comes as the American-led coalition is trying to regain the initiative in the struggle with the Islamic State, holds out the possibility of progress along a new front in northern Iraq against the militants.The aim is to add pressure on Islamic State fighters who are being pressed militarily in northeast Syria and Iraq. They are currently partly encircled in Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province in Iraq, and were recently evicted from Baiji in northern Iraq, site of a strategic oil refinery.The pesh merga also plan to cut the supply line, Highway 47, the major east-west road that runs past Sinjar and connects Syria to Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, which the Islamic State captured last year. That would hamper the easy movement of fighters, fuel and supplies within the Islamic State's self-declared caliphate and force the militants to resort to less efficient smuggling routes.Still, the operation faces several important military and political challenges.Even if the Sinjar campaign succeeds, the Islamic State still has a stranglehold on vital areas in the region, including Mosul and large portions of eastern Syria and western Iraq. That includes most of the Sunni Arab heartland of Anbar Province, where a government-led military push has advanced toward Ramadi but has not yet managed to retake it from the Islamic State.Before the Islamic State swept across northern Iraq, the area was a political stronghold for the Kurdistan Democratic Party of President Massoud Barzani, the leader of the Kurdish autonomous region in Iraq, who is overseeing the Sinjar operation from a command post in northwest Iraq.But many Yazidis -- a tiny religious minority that was almost entirely based around Mount Sinjar before the Islamic State's advance -- blame the pesh merga and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, commonly known as the K.D.P., for failing to prevent Sinjar's fall in the first place and subjecting them to a catalog of horrors by the Islamic State, including the sexual enslavement of thousands of women.That calamity led to the flight of hundreds of thousands of Yazidis, tens of thousands of whom spent a week or more exposed to a blazing August sun on the barren slopes of Mount Sinjar with little food or water.While a Yazidi regiment is to participate in part of the pesh merga offensive, other Yazidi fighters have been operating independently, and all are eager to exact revenge on the Islamic State fighters for their actions 15 months ago, when they overran Mount Sinjar.Tactically, preparations for the Sinjar offensive have been underway for weeks, and the Islamic State appears to have anticipated the assault and has been sending reinforcements, General Waisi said.With more than a year to dig in, the militants are also believed to have fortified their positions and made plans for a counterstrike.Throughout the conflict, the Islamic State has used improvised explosive devices to create dense minefields. The aim is to slow down attacking forces and channel them into ""kill zones"" so they can be targeted with sniper fire, mortars or machine-gun fire. Many of the houses in Sinjar are believed to be rigged with explosives.Using suicide car bombs, the militants are also poised to mount counterattacks from Tal Afar to the east, from the towns of Blij and Baaj to the south and from Syria to the west.""They try to identify a weak point in the defense and then send everything possible to that single point,"" General Waisi said. ""It starts with suicide bombers and then heavy machine guns. We know their tactics, but there will be surprises.""The operation on Thursday was timed to coincide with forecasts of several days of clear weather. That would enable the United States to provide more air power, including A-10 Warthog attack jets based in Turkey.Still, coping with the Islamic State's improvised explosive devices will not be easy for the pesh merga, who suffered losses of more than two dozen, virtually all from such explosives, in a recent operation near Kirkuk, according to allied officials.Unlike the Iraqi Army forces surrounding Ramadi, the pesh merga have not been provided with special breaching equipment, in which a cable festooned with explosives is used to blast a path through a minefield.The pesh merga have received 40 mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles, or MRAPs, from the United States, 15 of which have special rollers attached to clear mines. But Kurdish officials say the vehicles are not nearly enough given the 600-mile front the Kurds share with the Islamic State. Nor have armored Humvees or armored bulldozers been provided by the Americans.American officials say that more MRAPs and armored Humvees will be provided if the pesh merga follow through with plans to establish two new brigades that will integrate fighters from the Kurds' two dominant political parties: the K.D.P. and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. But action to establish those brigades has yet to be taken, and the process of equipping and training them would take several months.The pesh merga have received hundreds of Milan antitank missiles from Germany and 1,000 AT4 antitank weapons from the United States, officials say. Kurds say the Milan missiles have proved to be the most useful in defending against suicide vehicle attacks, but pesh merga commanders say they need more of them.The American-led coalition has also provided the pesh merga with a large number of small arms, including machine guns, rifles, mortar tubes and mortar rounds. As the Sinjar offensive has approached, Kurdish officials say, the coalition has been rushing in new supplies of ammunition as well.An Italian colonel has been leading a multinational effort to train the Kurdish forces at three bases in Iraqi Kurdistan. American, Canadian and other foreign Special Operations forces have also been advising the pesh merga at their defensive positions in the Kurdish region, although officials said they would not be accompanying the Kurdish forces to Sinjar.After a year of occupation by the Islamic State, as well as American airstrikes and constant skirmishes, Sinjar is a wreck. Kurdish officials do not plan to return civilians there anytime soon or to quickly rebuild the town, which could remain vulnerable to occasional artillery and mortar attacks from Islamic State militants to the south.Still, there have been tensions in recent weeks between the pesh merga and the main Syrian Kurdish militia, which is also operating on the Iraqi side of the border. The friction concerns who will participate in the operation and, perhaps more important, who will control the area if the Islamic State were to be pushed out.Analysts say the Yazidis still have not forgiven the K.D.P. for retreating in the face of the Islamic State offensive last year, leaving them vulnerable to the jihadis, who consider the Yazidis infidels. Their sympathies now lie more with a Syrian affiliate of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which came to their rescue and established a permanent base there.""Yazidi support has shifted away from the K.D.P.,"" said Christine van den Toorn, who directs the Institute for Regional and International Studies at the American University of Iraq, Sulaimaniya. ""If Sinjar is to be retaken from ISIS, repopulated and rebuilt, the K.D.P. cannot be the only liberator and ruler.""Even if Sinjar is retaken and the highway is cut, more military steps will need to be taken if the American-led coalition wants to cut off supplies from Syria to Mosul, said Michael Knights, a military expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.""It will slow down the flow of Islamic State traffic to and from Mosul,"" Mr. Knights said. ""That traffic will be forced to move on desert tracks and local roads to the south of Sinjar, which will greatly reduce the flow.""And if winter rain floods the wadis,"" he said, ""those secondary routes could be unavailable.""Map The Operation Comes As the American-Led Coalition Is Trying to Regain the Initiative in the Struggle with the Islamic State.",1.0
U.S. Strategy to End Killing in Syria Is Met With Doubts:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- For the first time in the four-year Syrian civil war, President Obama is beginning to execute a combined diplomatic and military approach to force President Bashar al-Assad to leave office and end the carnage.As 50 Special Operations troops arrive in Syria to bolster the most effective opposition groups, the administration is gambling that Secretary of State John Kerry will have more leverage to push Russia, Iran and other players toward two objectives: a cease-fire to limit the cycle of killing and the establishment of a timeline for a transition of power.But the task is enormous, given the number of nations and rebel groups operating at cross-purposes and the tiny size of the American force. Even senior members of the administration express doubts in private about whether the effort is sufficient.While Mr. Kerry has been optimistic that diplomacy can end the carnage, and has criticized the White House internally for moving too slowly, he has conceded doubts to aides that his strategy of fast-paced diplomacy can harness so many fiercely opposed forces toward a political solution.Mr. Kerry will travel to Vienna this weekend, summoning many of Syria's neighbors and European powers to turn a vague declaration of principles, settled on two weeks ago, into a plan for a political agreement. The talks, at least so far, have not included representatives of Mr. Assad's government or the fractured rebel groups seeking to depose him, and Mr. Kerry is struggling to bring them to the negotiating room.But after years in which the Obama administration has been accused of largely sitting on the sidelines while a quarter-million Syrians died and millions more were displaced, Mr. Kerry seems buoyed by being at the center of the only diplomatic effort underway.""I can tell you that as long as he thinks there is a glimmer of possibility, he will not let go,"" Wendy R. Sherman, Mr. Kerry's under secretary for policy until six weeks ago, said recently.The move to increase pressure to create negotiating leverage echoes the strategy that the administration employed to force Iran into negotiations that led to a nuclear deal last summer. That effort, which involved economic sanctions, a bolstered military presence in the Persian Gulf and covert action, produced perhaps the most complex arms negotiations in American history.Yet in the Iran case, most of the world's major powers were in agreement. On Syria, there is no such unanimity.Russia and Iran remain Mr. Assad's two greatest protectors, though American officials detect a division on the question of whether Mr. Assad must stay in power. The Russians appear to have little faith that Mr. Assad can hold on, while the Iranians have dismissed the idea of looking for an alternative to him, though that may simply be posturing.On the other side of the table, America's partners are also divided. Saudi Arabia had to be dragged to the negotiations by Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry, after saying that a deal with Iran, its regional enemy, would be a fruitless exercise, and that Mr. Obama was being manipulated by the Iranians and the Russians in a bid for time.Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries have largely ceased participating in the air war over Syria, focusing instead on fighting insurgents in Yemen. Privately, many of the foreign ministers who attended the last Vienna session two weeks ago questioned whether Syria could survive as an independent country. Many intelligence analysts providing reports to Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry have expressed similar doubts.""I think this is not a strategy -- it's more like a line of effort,"" said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""There are different lines of effort now, all part of the evolution of the great game of Syria.""The Russians have floated a proposal that would provide for elections and leave open the possibility that Mr. Assad would guide the process, several diplomats at the United Nations who had seen it said on Tuesday. They said the proposal does not cite Mr. Assad by name. But American and many European officials have said any election must not be in Mr. Assad's control -- and must include Syrians who have fled the country.The United Nations' special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters at its New York headquarters on Tuesday that he hoped the Vienna meeting would deliver a concrete outcome, including a ""reduction in violence.""For Mr. Kerry, the Syria effort has become an obsession, much like his failed bid to strike an Israeli-Palestinian accord in 2013 and his so-far successful effort on the Iran nuclear deal this year. On a trip through Central Asia last week, he used every spare moment to make telephone calls from his plane or hotel to keep the diplomatic effort on track.The Syria situation ""may or may not be ripe"" for solution, Mr. Kerry told students at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard before he left on the trip. ""But it's imperative. It's a human catastrophe, a disaster that screams at all of us in public life to exercise responsibility in trying to find a solution.""At White House meetings, administration officials say, Mr. Kerry has argued that without applying both military and diplomatic pressure, the Russian intervention that began in late September would shore up Mr. Assad ""and actually wind up destroying Syria.""But the question is whether the military element of the strategy -- which reversed Mr. Obama's previous determination to keep American combat troops out of the country -- will be enough to make a difference.""What he is doing will not work,"" Fareed Zakaria, a journalist whom Mr. Obama frequently speaks with, wrote in a column in The Washington Post last week. ""In a few months,"" he predicted, the United States ""will face the challenge again -- back down or double down. So far, President Obama has responded each time with increased intervention.""Reflecting a willingness to do more, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said Sunday that additional troops could be sent to Syria if the United States could find more local forces to work with.The White House is hoping that the Syrian, Arab and Kurdish coalition, aided by American pilots and special operators on the ground, can seize and hold territory. The United States also plans to step up airstrikes. Mr. Obama deployed 12 A-10 warplanes and is sending additional F-15 fighter jets to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey.The theory is that over time the combination will increase the pressure on Mr. Assad to step down. The immediate focus is not on Mr. Assad's strongholds, though; it is on territory seized by the Islamic State, including its capital, Raqqa.But there is a far more immediate problem: identifying friends and enemies on the ground in Syria. Several rebel groups aided by the United States have been bombed by the Russians in recent weeks. American officials say they believe that Russia is trying to wipe out Mr. Assad's opponents while claiming that it is going after the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.Eventually, American and Russian officials will have to share lists about the groups that they support and that could be credible interlocutors for a cease-fire and political solution. But the United States has declined to do so, for fear that the Russians or Mr. Assad would immediately target the groups for attacks.Then would come the practical problem of engineering a cease-fire and a referendum to replace Mr. Assad.The 50 Special Operations troops, American officials said, will attach themselves to commanders of the tribal affiliates in northern Syria and coordinate with the Kurdish militia known as the Y.P.G. That group has dealt the Islamic State its most significant setbacks across northern Syria near the Turkish border.""You've got the elements of a combined political and military strategy,"" said Derek Chollet, a former assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. ""That, to me, is the key part -- beating ISIS for our own interest, but changing the complexion of the Syrian opposition so that the moderates are the more powerful ones. That is key to getting Assad out.""Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.",1.0
"NATO Exercise Unwittingly Put Soviets on 'Hair Trigger' in '83, Analysis Suggests:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"In December 1988, Jörg Winger was a West German Army radio operator eavesdropping on Soviet military channels when he overheard a startling message: The Russians wished him Merry Christmas by name.""That was the moment where we realized that we had moles on the base,"" he recalled.Mr. Winger, now a television producer, and his wife, Anna LeVine Winger, an American author, later harvested that incongruous holiday greeting as grist for a retro series, ""Deutschland 83."" They consulted a historian who provided an even more dramatic narrative arc: In 1983, according to recently declassified documents, the Russians apparently became convinced that a NATO nuclear training exercise code named Able Archer 83 was a cover for an actual nuclear strike against the Warsaw Pact nations.Last month, the American government finally declassified a presidential analysis of Able Archer and the Russian response that definitively dramatized how the two superpowers came closer to a nuclear war than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis two decades earlier -- and, this time, by accident.""In this case truth turned out to be at least as strange as fiction,"" said Klaas Voss, the historian at the Hamburg Institute for Social Research who advised the producers. ""The war scare was as real as it gets.""Dr. Voss and the Wingers knew of the story but not of the document until it was made public.According to the Feb. 15, 1990, analysis by the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, ""In 1983 we may have inadvertently placed our relations with the Soviet Union on a hair trigger.""The fact that the Warsaw Pact's military response to Able Archer was ""unparalleled in scale,"" the board concluded, ""strongly suggests to us that Soviet military leaders may have been seriously concerned that the U.S. would use Able Archer 83 as a cover for launching a real attack"" and that ""some Soviet forces were preparing to pre-empt or counterattack a NATO strike launched under cover of Able Archer.""""This situation could have been extremely dangerous if during the exercise -- perhaps through a series of ill-timed coincidences or because of faulty intelligence -- the Soviets had misperceived U.S. actions as preparations for a real attack,"" the report said.While the Soviets were transporting nuclear weapons to launchers and assigning priority targets, NATO commanders appeared to be either oblivious to the apprehension in Moscow -- already jittery over the Reagan administration's Star Wars missile defense initiative, the deployment of American Pershing II missiles in Europe and the incapacitation by illness of much of the aging Soviet leadership -- or discounted it.In ""Deutschland 83,"" an East German spy who has infiltrated the alliance command reveals himself to avert a war. In reality, Lt. Gen. Leonard H. Perroots, deputy chief of staff for intelligence of American Air Forces in Europe, made what the advisory board described as a ""fortuitous, if ill-informed"" decision not to respond to signs of the elevated Soviet military alert.""Really scary,"" the board's report quoted President Ronald Reagan as saying in June 1984 after he read ""a rather stunning array of indicators"" of Soviet aggressiveness in the wake of Able Archer compiled by his C.I.A. director, William J. Casey.The advisory board's heavily redacted 94-page report was made public last month, 11 years after the National Security Archive at George Washington University, a nongovernmental group that focuses on transparency, asked that it be declassified.""This new report is the first all-source assessment, as of 1990, and should clinch the debate: This is hugely important. This war scare was real,"" said Thomas S. Blanton, the archive director. ""Turns out, 1983 is a classic, like the Cuban missile crisis, where neither superpower intended to go nuclear, but the risk of inadvertence, miscalculation, misperception were just really high. Cuba led J.F.K. to the test ban. Nineteen eighty-three led Reagan to Reykjavik and almost to abolition.""The document came to light as tensions between Washington and Moscow have again escalated.""Deutschland 83"" debuted in the United States in June and will be shown in Germany later this month.""Whenever you are writing about history, you're really writing about the present as well,"" Ms. Winger said. ""I'm not sure we meant the story as a warning, exactly, but certainly we wanted to make people think about all these things. We always imagine history is created by a massive groundswell of choreography, but at the end of the day an individual has to make decisions.""The Russians were making their decisions, in part, by feeding 40,000 variables into a computer to predict the likelihood of nuclear attack.""Soviet intelligence clearly had tipoffs"" to the Able Archer exercise, the advisory board's report said, and some scenarios suggested a nuclear first strike.""It is an especially grave error to assume that since we know the U.S. is not going to start World War III,"" the board warned, ""the next leaders of the Kremlin will also believe that -- and act on that belief.""",1.0
Hospital Strike Fueled by Units New to Kunduz:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- The American airstrike against a Doctors Without Borders hospital in northern Afghanistan that killed at least 22 staff members and patients was approved by American Special Operations Forces.The Afghan commandos who requested the strike had been rushed from another part of the country to help quell the Taliban attack. And the AC-130 gunship that unleashed the fire had not worked with either group before.Military investigators have not yet reached any final conclusions about how the Oct. 3 attack in Kunduz occurred, but an emerging focus of investigators is how the lack of familiarity of American and Afghan forces with the area and their lack of experience in working together may have directly contributed to the series of mistaken decisions that led to the attack, American officials said. They attributed those problems, in part, to the withdrawal of American forces from northern Afghanistan that has been part of the gradual drawdown of United States forces in the country.""The Afghan units and U.S. forces did not have much or any time working together,"" one senior Defense Department official said on Tuesday. ""The Kunduz operation was a hasty response, which always increases risk as there is insufficient time for deliberate planning.""Investigators are examining closely what Gen. John F. Campbell, the commander of American forces in Afghanistan, has described as ""a special operations unit that was in close vicinity that was talking to the aircraft that delivered those fires.""Two Pentagon officials said the unit was assigned to the Army's Third Special Forces Group, with headquarters at Fort Bragg, N.C. For most of the war in Afghanistan, the Third Group and the Seventh Group, have done the lion's share of Green Beret missions in Afghanistan but have not typically operated in the city of Kunduz, military officials said.Third Group soldiers have regularly rotated Green Beret teams into Afghanistan and thus have expertise in languages, cultures and customs of the region-- but their operations have typically been in more rural areas than urban centers, the officials said.While the First Group has rotated Green Beret teams into Afghanistan before, its historical mission -- geographically, as well as its expertise in languages, cultures and customs -- has been other parts of Asia.A spokesman for allied forces in Afghanistan, Col. Brian Tribus, declined to give any details about the Special Forces units in Afghanistan, citing the investigations.Also under scrutiny is the role of the Afghan troops who requested the airstrike after coming under hostile fire. A senior Afghan security official said the Afghan troops were a rapid-reaction commando force that had arrived in Kunduz just days before the airstrike.The commandos, who were dispatched from Kabul on Sept. 29, the day after Kunduz fell to the Taliban, would not have been very familiar with the terrain, the official said.Finally, investigators are interviewing the crew of the AC-130 gunship, and reviewing transcripts of the audiotapes between the aircrew and the Americans on the ground approving the strike, as well as gun-camera video of the strike itself.But no evidence has yet emerged that the Afghan troops who called in the strike were under fire from the hospital, said the senior Afghan security official, who works closely with American forces.The results of the first of three inquiries into the attack on the Doctors Without Borders hospital will most likely be released later this week, Pentagon officials said on Tuesday. That inquiry, conducted by NATO officers, is to determine whether civilians were killed, something that all sides quickly agreed did occur. But it may offer new insights into events leading up to the strike.American officials now acknowledge, for instance, that the hospital was on a ""protected list"" of specially designated buildings like mosques or schools, to avoid the very kind of strike that happened. But investigators are still trying to determine why the Afghans, the American Special Forces and the gunship crew apparently were not aware of that.Other factors most likely contributing to the airstrike have previously emerged. General Campbell, according to military officials, believes that United States troops probably did not follow their own rules in calling in the airstrike when no American and Afghan troops were in extreme danger, according to officials with direct knowledge of the general's thinking.Under the rules, airstrikes are authorized to kill terrorists, protect American troops and help Afghans who request support in battles -- like those in Kunduz -- that can change the military landscape. The idea is to give troops leeway, but keep Americans out of daily, open-ended combat.The Special Operations Forces most likely did not meet any of the criteria, General Campbell has said in private discussions, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter has resisted making any judgments on specific American culpability pending the outcome in the next few weeks of an investigation led by an Army officer, Brig. Gen. Richard Kim, who reports to General Campbell.""If there are people who need to be held accountable, they need to be held accountable on the basis of those facts,"" Mr. Carter said earlier this month.General Campbell has already accepted blame for the attack, and the Pentagon has said the military will be authorized to make condolence payments to the families of the civilians killed, and to pay for repairs to rebuild the hospital.Since the strike, a number of Afghan officials, including Masoom Stanekzai, the acting defense minister, have publicly claimed that the Taliban were fighting from the hospital, and that the insurgents were storing heavy weapons there. There has also been talk of operatives from Pakistan's main spy agency, the Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence, using the hospital as a base from which to help direct Taliban fighters in Kunduz.But the Aghan security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid directly contradicting other officials, dismissed all those claims as ""unfounded -- there is no hard evidence.""The hospital had treated many wounded Taliban fighters over the years, and some may have been there at the time of the strike. But ""they were not fighting right then,"" the official said.The official said that many in the Afghan government were desperate to clear the Americans of any wrongdoing in the attack. They were fearful that the fallout from the strike would lead President Obama to place even tighter limits on American troops in Afghanistan, and leave Afghan forces without the backing they need to keep the Taliban at bay throughout Afghanistan.The officials pointed to the Afghan investigation into the attack, which they said was part of a broader inquiry into the fall of Kunduz, and was being led by two former officials who at times have close relationships with the American-led coalition.But, the security official said, ""right now, it does not look like this attack can be blamed on the Taliban.""",1.0
U.S. and Iraqi Forces Take Offensive Against Islamic State on Several Fronts:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BAGHDAD -- Struggling to regain the initiative after a long impasse in the battle against Islamic State militants, the Iraqi government and the American-led coalition are for the first time in months putting military pressure on the jihadists on multiple fronts, officials say.Supported by increased American air power, Iraqi forces are on the outskirts of Ramadi, pressing to encircle the capital of Anbar Province, which the militants took in May, and cut it off from resupply and reinforcements.To the north of Baghdad, Iraqi military forces and Iranian-backed Shiite militias are trying to expand their foothold at the Baiji oil refinery after retaking it from the Islamic State on Friday.And in northeast Syria, the American military last week said it had parachuted 50 tons of ammunition to Syrian Arab fighters. The intent was that those fighters would join a larger body of Kurdish forces in advancing toward Raqqa, the Islamic State's capital in Syria, and perhaps draw some Islamic State fighters away from Iraq to defend the city.""We are doing what you always try to do to the enemy and that is force him to fight in more than one direction at the same time,"" said Lt. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who last month became the American commander for the effort in Iraq and Syria. He had previously served in Iraq as a brigade commander who worked with the Sunni tribes in Anbar Province.The campaign that General MacFarland inherited is not on the timetable originally envisioned. The United States Central Command, which oversees American operations in the Middle East, had once hoped that Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, would be in the Iraqi government's hands by now.Instead, the American-led coalition has found itself trying to jump-start a counteroffensive against the Islamic State in a region in which the Russians and Iranians are asserting themselves in neighboring Syria, and Shiite militias remain a potent political force in Iraq. At the same time, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq has been struggling to build up his authority.Even as the Iraqis have moved on the offensive, they face formidable challenges. Ramadi, for example, is defended by 600 or more militants who have fortified their positions and are still able to sneak fighters to the city on the Euphrates River.And even if the Iraqis succeed in evicting the Islamic State from many of their strongholds, holding them will be a challenge. While Iraqi tribes can help secure some towns and cities, Iraqi provincial police are also supposed to play an important role. But the training of those police forces is just in the early phases: So far, a small team of Italian Carabinieri has trained just 246 police officers, about half of whom are federal police, officials said.But after a long lull, partly imposed by scorching heat and Muslim holidays, the Iraqis and their partners are trying to put the militants on the defensive and force them out of some long-held bastions into the open where they can be more readily targeted by airstrikes, Iraqi officials said.The aim, Iraq's defense minister, Khaled al-Obeidi, said in an interview, is ""to busy the enemy on different axes.""As described by American officials and their allies, the overall strategy is less a product of clockwork synchronization than taking advantage of opportunities that have arisen in recent weeks.The first step to speed up the Ramadi offensive was taken in late August when Mr. Abadi appointed a new head of the Anbar Operations Command, Maj. Gen. Ismail Mahalawi, who he hoped would be more aggressive than his predecessor, who had been wounded in a mortar attack.Some 10,000 Iraqi troops have been trying to isolate the city, advancing from the north, west, south and southeast. One of their key objectives is a bridge that spans the Euphrates northwest of the city, which Iraqi forces want to take in order to stop the Islamic State from using the river to bring in reinforcements.For the first time, Iraqi F-16 warplanes with pilots trained in the Arizona desert have joined other allied warplanes in carrying out airstrikes to support Iraqi ground troops, officials said.The Islamic State fighters holding Ramadi, American officials say, are accomplished in combining terrorist tactics, like the use of suicide car bombs, with more conventional military tactics like rigging houses with explosive traps and packing stretches of road with explosives and then covering the areas with mortar and sniper fire.To help the Iraqi military forge a path through the fortifications, the United States is providing the Iraqi forces with armored bulldozers and mine-clearing devices in which a cable festooned with explosives is fired across the battlefield and then detonated.Progress has been slow despite increased supporting fire from American air operations -- about 70 strikes in the past two weeks, according to the Pentagon. An Iraqi unit advanced to an apartment complex on the southern fringe of the city in recent days only to withdraw after the militants counterattacked.While Iraqi soldiers have been edging toward Ramadi, about 5,000 Iraqi soldiers and national police officers, along with around 10,000 Shiite militia fighters, have been mounting a parallel push in and around the Baiji refinery. Militants are still being pursued in the nearby town of Baiji, where some neighborhoods have been battered by artillery and airstrikes and many electrical cables have been severed.The refinery itself, a sprawling installation that has changed hands several times in fighting over the past year, has been so damaged it will probably take years to restore it to full use, officials say. But it is still considered an important installation, and its location is strategically vital: Control of the surrounding area would provide a potential steppingstone for any eventual Iraqi offensive against the Islamic State in the northern province of Nineveh, where the militants control the major city of Mosul.Long-term control of Baiji would also improve the security of the two major Iraqi cities to the south -- Tikrit and Samarra -- and would curtail access to a major road to the southwest that the Islamic State has been using to funnel fighters from Mosul to Anbar.The Baiji offensive is being overseen by Maj. Gen. Juma al-Jubouri, from the Iraqi military's command center in Salahuddin.But Iraq and the American-led coalition are not the only ones who have a stake in the success. So important is this juncture of the campaign that Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the head of Iran's paramilitary Quds Force, arrived on the scene last week, apparently to help guide some of the Shiite militias that Iran has been supporting, American officials said.The Baiji offensive is a critical one for Mr. Abadi, who is facing internal political pressures within his Shiite coalition to show some progress and who is dealing with militias who have a mind of their own. Officials say allowing the militias to take a major role in that fight eases some of those tensions and also routes most of the militias away from the Ramadi offensive, where a major presence of the irregular forces might alienate the mostly Sunni population or lead to sectarian abuses.The Iraqi government's reliance on militia forces there is also partly a reflection of how efforts to train and equip army units, which American officials believe should conduct the main counteroffensive against the Islamic State, have lagged behind goals set last year. That objective was to train 12 brigades, but the readjusted goal is eight, officials said: six Iraq Army brigades and two Kurdish ones.Still, the participation of the militias is a sensitive issue for the United States, which has made clear that it will conduct airstrikes only to support Iraqi government forces.At the Americans' insistence, Iraq's counterterrorism services, the federal police and the Iraq Army were given the lead in the Baiji operation. But the Shiite militia fighters have clearly benefited from the weeks of United States bombing.""Look, we're trying to do this cleanly,"" said one senior American officer in Washington, meaning supporting only Iraq forces, not the Iranian-trained militias, ""but in Iraq, it's just never that clean.""",1.0
Qaeda Cell Leader Killed in Drone Strike in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- A military airstrike in northwest Syria has killed the leader of a shadowy Qaeda cell that American officials say has been plotting attacks against the United States and Europe, the Pentagon announced on Sunday.The leader, Sanafi al-Nasr, a Saudi citizen, was the highest-ranking leader of a network of about two dozen veteran Qaeda operatives called the Khorasan Group, and the fifth senior member of the group to be killed in the past four months. His death was announced in a Pentagon statement describing Thursday's operation, which American officials said was a drone strike.The American use of drones, as opposed to piloted aircraft, to carry out such strikes may reduce the stakes of any inadvertent confrontation with Russian planes over Syria. For nearly three weeks, Russia has carried out strikes in support of the embattled Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, including some that have killed American-trained Syrian rebels. But last week's successful drone strike is not expected to resolve a continuing policy debate over the long-term success of targeting individual terrorist leaders.The dead Khorasan leader, whose full name was Abdul Mohsen Abdallah Ibrahim al Charekh, was a longtime militant experienced in funneling money and fighters for Al Qaeda, said Peter Cook, the Pentagon press secretary.The statement from Mr. Cook said Mr. Nasr had organized and maintained routes for new recruits to travel from Pakistan to Syria through Turkey, in addition to helping Al Qaeda's external operations in the West. Mr. Nasr previously worked for Al Qaeda's Iran-based facilitation network and, in 2012, he took charge of the group's core finances before relocating to Syria in 2013.In imposing terrorism sanctions on Mr. Nasr last year, the Treasury Department said he had raised money and facilitated travel to Syria for the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria.""Al-Nasr is important as a financier for Al Qaeda with key connections in the Gulf states,"" said Bruce O. Riedel, a former C.I.A. analyst who is now at the Brookings Institution.Last week's strike was another significant blow to the Khorasan network, American terrorism officials said. In early July, the group's founding leader, Muhsin al-Fadhli, was killed while traveling in a vehicle near Sarmada, in northwestern Syria. Mr. Fadhli was a senior Qaeda operative who, according to the State Department, was so close to Osama bin Laden that he was among a small group of people who knew about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks before they were launched.Also in July, David Drugeon, a French citizen and an explosives expert for Khorasan, was killed in an allied airstrike near Aleppo, Syria.As the United States has shifted its main counterterrorism focus to the Islamic State from Al Qaeda, intelligence officials say the Khorasan Group has emerged as the cell in Syria that may be the most intent on, and capable of, striking the United States or its Western allies with an organized terrorist attack.Matthew G. Olsen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said the succession of strikes against Khorasan had significantly hurt its ability to plot attacks.""It seem plausible that the deaths of so many of these guys in Syria over the past year has really degraded the Khorasan Group as a whole,"" Mr. Olsen said. The American effort has also helped prevent Al Qaeda from taking advantage of the chaos in Syria to find space in which to operate, he said.There is little public information about the Khorasan Group, which American officials say is made up of about two dozen seasoned Qaeda operatives from the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa who were sent to Syria by Ayman al-Zawahri, Al Qaeda's leader who is believed to be in Pakistan. Embedded within the Nusra Front, the Khorasan operatives were to recruit Europeans and Americans whose passports allow them to travel on American-bound jetliners with less scrutiny from security officials.Micah Zenko, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, said experts inside and outside the government were divided over the long-term efficacy of a so-called decapitation strategy, in which a terrorist group's leaders are killed.""There's a pretty vigorous debate within the security community about whether this works,"" Mr. Zenko said. Some officials believe that the fear of strikes makes it harder for extremists to meet and communicate and that killing leaders means advancing less competent operatives.But Mr. Zenko said he was among the skeptics. The decapitation approach, he said, really becomes a ""recapitation"" strategy because the targeted groups learn to anticipate the deaths of leaders and prepare deputies to succeed them. Any disruption tends to be temporary, he said.He noted that American officials thought the coalition fighting the Islamic State extremists had killed about 20,000 fighters, but that estimates of the size of the existing fighting force had barely changed. ""They're just replenishing, either with recruits from within Syria and Iraq or with foreign fighters,"" he said.Some American officials believe, however, that as a small, specialized force specifically focused on attacks against the West, the Khorasan Group is more susceptible to disruption by strikes than either the Islamic State or the Nusra Front.",1.0
World Briefing | Europe; Turkey: Jets Shoot Down a Drone:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Turkish fighter jets shot down a drone aircraft close to the Syrian border on Friday after it violated Turkey's airspace, the military said in a statement.""An aerial vehicle of unknown origin was detected inside our airspace on the Syrian border,"" the statement said, adding, ""Our aircraft on patrol mission on the border fired and shot down the vehicle within the rules of engagement.""Since Russia began its military intervention in Syria on Sept. 30 with a series of airstrikes, Turkey has complained several times of incursions by Russian aircraft into its airspace. The Russians have said that the incursions were unintentional, but NATO, of which Turkey is a member, has moved to bolster the alliance's defenses.News agencies in Russia reported on Friday that the aircraft was not Russian. However, Reuters quoted an anonymous United States official as saying that American officials suspected that it was Russian.In Moscow, the Defense Ministry said that all of its warplanes operating in Syria had returned safely to base and that its drones were conducting aerial reconnaissance ""as usual.""""All airplanes of the Russian aviation group in the Syrian Arab Republic have returned to the Hmeimim air base after accomplishing their combat tasks,"" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Defense Ministry spokesman, told reporters on Friday, according to the Interfax news agency.Turkey has in the past brought down several drones operated by the Syrian Air Force, which is loyal to the country's embattled president, Bashar al-Assad.The last time Turkey shot down an aircraft on its border with Syria was in May, when the military claimed that a Syrian warplane had violated its airspace in the eastern region of Hatay. Syrian state television said the Turkish fighter jets had shot down a drone.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
Aid Group Sets Inquiry Into Strike on Hospital:   [Foreign Desk ],,"PARIS -- The aid group Doctors Without Borders said on Wednesday that an independent investigation into the American military airstrike that gutted the group's trauma hospital in the northern Afghan city of Kunduz on Oct. 3 would begin pending the agreement of the United States and Afghan governments.The group called for the investigation, to be conducted by the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission, after criticizing the shifting accounts of the strike by American officials in the days after the attack. At least 22 people were killed, including 12 of the group's staff members.""We have received apologies and condolences, but this is not enough. We are still in the dark about why a well-known hospital full of patients and medical staff was repeatedly bombarded for more than an hour,"" said Dr. Joanne Liu, the president of Doctors Without Borders, a French-based group also known as Médecins Sans Frontières. ""We need to understand what happened and why.""In Kunduz, as fighting ebbed after the withdrawal of Taliban fighters from the city center, images of the hospital showed extensive wreckage. Doctors Without Borders said in a statement that the hospital's destruction had left tens of thousands of people without access to emergency care after weeks of intense fighting for the city.The United States military and the Afghan government have said that they will conduct investigations into the airstrike, but no details from those processes have been released yet.""Even behind a mistake, there is still a potential violation of humanitarian law that may amount to a war crime,"" said Françoise Bouchet-Saulnier, a legal director with Doctors Without Borders.The International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission was established under the Additional Protocols of the Geneva Conventions to investigate humanitarian violations, according to the group. The Doctors Without Borders statement said the commission had sent letters to the governments of Afghanistan and the United States on Wednesday seeking cooperation and was awaiting their response to go ahead with its inquiry.Photograph The Aftermath of the United States Airstrike On the Doctors Without Borders Hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, Which Killed at Least 22 People.

Russian-Made Missile Brought Down Airliner:   [Foreign Desk ],,"PARIS -- A 15-month inquiry into the disintegration of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in the skies over eastern Ukraine has concluded that the aircraft was struck by a Russian-made missile, Dutch air accident investigators said Tuesday.The findings -- based in part on a distinctive shrapnel pattern that was found in the cockpit, near where the missile hit -- come from a five-nation investigative team that retrieved and sifted through several tons of debris and human remains and even reconstructed the aircraft as part of its study.""Flight MH17 crashed as a result of the detonation of a warhead outside the airplane above the left-hand side of the cockpit,"" said Tjibbe Joustra, chairman of the Dutch Safety Board, using a common reference to the flight number. The explosion tore off the forward part of the plane, which broke up in the air. The crash killed all 298 people aboard; the investigation found that many died instantly, while others quickly lost consciousness. ""It is likely that the occupants were barely able to comprehend their situation,"" the board found.While the findings stop short of assigning responsibility for the crash, a task that has been left to Dutch prosecutors, they appear consistent with a theory widely promoted by the authorities in the United States and Ukraine: that the plane, a Boeing 777, was shot down by Russian-backed separatists armed with an SA-11, or Buk, surface-to-air missile launcher.Russia has vehemently disputed that theory, and it continued to do so Tuesday with a competing presentation, saying that the missile must have been fired from Ukrainian-held territory, and that it was of a type that is no longer found in Russia's arsenal.The report on the July 17, 2014, crash was presented at the Gilze-Rijen Air Base in the Netherlands. The 283 passengers and 15 crew members on the flight, which was en route to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from Amsterdam, came from about a dozen countries; 193 of the passengers were Dutch.The board was sharply critical of the Ukrainian authorities for failing to close the airspace above the conflict zone. It found that 160 civil aviation flights went through on the day of the crash before the airspace was closed.""Why was Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 flying over an area where an armed conflict was taking place?"" Mr. Joustra asked. ""The question was on the minds of many people after the crash. The answer was as straightforward as it is disquieting: Almost all operators were flying over that area. And why? Because nobody thought that civil aviation was at risk.""There was sufficient reason to close the airspace as a precaution, but ""the Ukrainian authorities failed to do so,"" he said.The Ukrainian foreign minister, Pavlo Klimkin, told reporters at a press briefing at the United Nations that his country wanted a criminal investigation to ""expose perpetrators."" Asked why Ukraine had not closed its airspace, Mr. Klimkin said the Ukrainian authorities had been unaware that antiaircraft weapons were being used in the area.The report is unlikely to produce consensus. Based on the impact pattern, the impact angle and other data, the Dutch board concluded that the missile originated in an area of about 123 square miles in eastern Ukraine. But Russian experts say the area must be smaller, and Ukrainian experts say it was smaller still.The team of investigators was led by the Netherlands but included members from four other countries heavily affected by the crash: Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine.While the new report was not surprising -- and is consistent with preliminary findings the safety board released a year ago -- it is likely to increase geopolitical pressure on Russia. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in arming separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine or the shooting down of the Malaysia Airlines flight.Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia, which had 43 citizens on the plane, said Tuesday, ""We now know that the plane was hit by a Russian-made Buk missile fired from rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine.""He urged ""the strongest action possible against those responsible"" and promised that ""Malaysia will remain steadfast until those behind this heinous act are made to pay for their crimes.""Ukraine's prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, was more blunt in assigning blame, accusing the Russians. ""Our experts and specialists carried out dozens of tests that will also be made public,"" Mr. Yatsenyuk told a government meeting Tuesday before the Dutch report's publication.""We are convinced it was carried out solely from territory controlled by pro-Russian fighters,"" he said. ""And there is no doubt that drunken separatists are not able to operate Buk systems, and this means these systems were operated solely by professional Russian soldiers.""In addition to studying the causes of the crash, the Dutch report examined the delay in confirming the identities of those onboard -- in some cases, relatives waited as long as 14 days to get confirmation -- and shortcomings in the systems that governments have in place for communicating risks to commercial airliners when flying over conflict zones.While the new report was not intended to assign blame, the Dutch board made public a telltale detail: Investigators had discovered tiny pieces of shrapnel in a distinctive shape, which has been compared to a butterfly, a bowtie or an hourglass.The board said it had extracted butterfly-shaped shrapnel from the body of a pilot, allowing investigators to identify the type of warhead used: 9N314M, a model used to arm two common variants of the Buk, the 9M38 and the 9M38-M1.The 9N314M shrapnel pattern is now very much at the core of the debate over who is to blame for shooting down the plane.Throughout the summer -- as the approach of the report neared -- the company that makes the Buk missile system, Almaz-Antey, asserted that no evidence had been found at the crash site in Ukraine of shrapnel of this shape, which they described as an ""I-beam"" form.On Tuesday, the company said that, as an experiment, it had detonated the type of warhead the Dutch safety board said had brought down the airplane, the 9N314M, beside a decommissioned Il-86 airplane. The intent, it said, was to demonstrate that if such a warhead were used, many bowtie-shaped pieces of shrapnel would lodge in the debris.In fact, this is exactly what the Dutch board said it had discovered in the bodies of the cockpit crew.Analysts said that both Buk variants could be found in Russian and Ukrainian arsenals, although Russia insists that they were withdrawn from active service several years ago.""This is not true,"" Nick de Larrinaga, the European editor of IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, said Tuesday when asked about the Russian claims. He said that both Buk types and their launchers had been on display during Russian military parades and exercises in recent years.""It's possible that they could have been withdrawn from front-line service, but they could still be in reserve service,"" Mr. de Larrinaga said in a telephone interview from London. He added that a significant amount of older Russian military hardware had made its way to the battlefield during the Ukrainian conflict.Mr. de Larrinaga said that while the Dutch findings did not make it possible to categorically rule out the possibility that the missile that hit Flight 17 might have been of Ukrainian origin, he said other elements of the investigation pointed ""conclusively"" to the scenario that the plane was shot down by pro-Russian separatists.

U.S. Tells Asian Allies That Navy Will Patrol Near Disputed Islands:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIJING -- The United States has been briefing its allies in Asia on plans to conduct naval patrols near artificial islands built by China in the disputed South China Sea, a move that could escalate tensions with Beijing after President Xi Jinping's recent visit to Washington, American and Asian officials have said.The ""freedom of navigation"" patrols, which would come within 12 nautical miles of at least one of the islands, are intended to challenge China's efforts to claim large parts of the strategic waterway by enlarging rocks and submerged reefs into islands big enough for military airstrips, radar equipment and lodging for soldiers, the officials said.Though China claims much of the South China Sea as sovereign territory, the 12-mile zone around the new islands is particularly delicate because international law says such artificial islands do not have sovereign rights up to the 12-mile limit.The United States has refrained from venturing that close to Chinese-occupied islands in the South China Sea since at least 2012. In May, a United States Navy surveillance plane flew near three of China's five artificial islands but did not go within their 12-mile territorial zones. Chinese Navy radio operators warned the Americans to leave the area.Officials in the Philippines said they had been told of the planned patrols in the last several days, and Senator Antonio F. Trillanes IV, the chairman of the national defense and security committee, said Monday that he welcomed the decision.The United States secretary of defense, Ashton B. Carter, and the secretary of state, John Kerry, were scheduled to discuss the patrols with their counterparts from Australia on Monday and Tuesday in Boston.The head of the United States Pacific Command, Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., whom the White House asked several months ago to offer options for how to respond to the Chinese actions in the South China Sea, was also scheduled to attend the meetings.The senior adviser on China at the National Security Council, Daniel Kritenbrink, told a gathering of American analysts of the region at a meeting in Washington that the White House had decided to proceed with the patrols, according to a participant who requested anonymity to discuss a closed-door briefing.Mr. Kritenbrink did not specify when the patrols would take place, but he suggested that they had been delayed so as not to disrupt Mr. Xi's visit, the participant said.The Obama administration and America's allies in Asia have debated at length how best to respond to China's moves in the South China Sea, with some urging patrols to push back against Beijing, and with others fearful that the Chinese might use the patrols as justification for a further military buildup.The Chinese have indicated that they will respond to American warships entering the 12-mile territorial waters around the artificial islands.""There is no way for us to condone infringement of China's territorial sea and airspace by any country under the pretext of maintaining the freedom of navigation and overflight,"" the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Friday. China is ""severely concerned"" about reports that the United States planned patrols around the artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago, the ministry's spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said. Five other governments also make territorial claims in those waters.During a news conference with President Obama at the White House, Mr. Xi said China had no intention of militarizing islands in the South China Sea. But exactly what Mr. Xi meant was unclear, American officials said, because he had not said anything like that in the private meetings with Mr. Obama and his senior aides.One purpose of the patrols would be to test Mr. Xi's statement, a United States military official said.At the news conference with Mr. Xi, Mr. Obama emphasized the importance of freedom of navigation, saying, ""The United States will continue to sail, fly and operate anywhere that international law allows.""The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea recognizes 12-mile territorial limits on naturally formed islands but does not recognize such limits on submerged reefs that have been built by land reclamation into above-the-waterline islands.The Chinese have recently built five such islands in the Spratly archipelago. On Fiery Cross Reef, they have completed a 10,000-foot runway capable of accommodating fighter jets.The new Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, would be less inclined to support the patrols than his more hawkish predecessor, Tony Abbott, said Hugh White, a defense analyst. Mr. Turnbull called China's island-building ""counterproductive"" before he took office last month, but he is likely to be cautious about confronting China, Mr. White said.In Manila, Mr. Trillanes said the patrols should move ahead. ""It's quite risky, but we need to know right now to what extent China is willing to go in order to defend these newly created islands,"" he said in a telephone interview.Mr. Trillanes said he was not concerned that such a move might increase the likelihood of conflict in the region. ""The United States has done the math, and they wouldn't do this if tensions would escalate beyond what they would expect,"" he said.Albert F. del Rosario, the Philippine secretary of foreign affairs, said the American patrols would help maintain stability in the region.""Failure to challenge false claims of sovereignty would undermine this order and lead China to the false conclusion that its claims are accepted as a fait accompli,"" Mr. del Rosario said in a statement.But other countries have seemed less receptive to the idea of aggressive action by the Americans.In an interview in August, Ng Eng Hen, the Singaporean defense minister, said the United States had a right to protect its interests, but he urged caution. ""It does no good for the region if there are incidents,"" he said.The United States has several options as to what kind of ships to send on the patrols, and the type of vessel will indicate how big a statement it wants to make, said James Hardy, the Asia-Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defense Weekly.A littoral combat ship that works close to shore has been used in the past for such patrols, Mr. Hardy said. The United States could also send an Arleigh Burke class destroyer accompanied by a couple of smaller ships, thus sending a firmer message, he said.The Chinese would also have choices of how to respond, Mr. Hardy said. They could buzz American ships with aircraft or target them with radar, as they have with Japanese vessels in the East China Sea, he said. Other options would include deploying coast guard vessels to shadow the United States Navy ships or using fishing vessels to get in the way of the patrols.",1.0
"As U.S. Escalates Air War on ISIS, Allies Fade Away:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"AL UDEID AIR BASE, Qatar -- As the United States prepares to intensify airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria, the Arab allies who with great fanfare sent warplanes on the initial missions there a year ago have largely vanished from the campaign.The Obama administration heralded the Arab air forces flying side by side with American fighter jets in the campaign's early days as an important show of solidarity against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Daesh. Top commanders like Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, who oversees operations in Syria and Iraq, still laud the Arab countries' contributions to the fight. But as the United States enters a critical phase of the war in Syria, ordering Special Operations troops to support rebel forces and sending two dozen attack planes to Turkey, the air campaign has evolved into a largely American effort.Administration officials had sought to avoid the appearance of another American-dominated war, even as most leaders in the Persian Gulf seem more preoccupied with supporting rebels fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Now, some of those officials note with resignation, the Arab partners have quietly left the United States to run the bulk of the air war in Syria -- not the first time Washington has found allies wanting.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have shifted most of their aircraft to their fight against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Jordan, reacting to the grisly execution of one of its pilots by the Islamic State, and in a show of solidarity with the Saudis, has also diverted combat flights to Yemen. Jets from Bahrain last struck targets in Syria in February, coalition officials said. Qatar is flying patrols over Syria, but its role has been modest.""They've all been busy doing other things, Yemen being the primary draw,"" Lt. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., who leads the air war from a $60 million command center at this sprawling base in Qatar, said of the Arab allies. He added that those allies still fly periodic missions in Syria and allow American jets to use their bases.The United Arab Emirates last carried out strikes in Syria in March; Jordan in August; and Saudi Arabia in September, according to information provided by allied officials last week. But the Arab allies insist they are still playing an essential, if less active, military role in the war.""Jordan's commitment to this fight is unwavering,"" said Dana Zureikat Daoud, a spokeswoman for the Jordanian Embassy in Washington. ""We remain an active partner and contributor to the international coalition, and continue to conduct airstrikes against Daesh targets.""The engagement of Western allies, like France and Australia, has also been limited. They have conducted a smattering of strikes in Syria, but have reserved most of their firepower for Islamic State targets in Iraq. Canada's new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has promised to fulfill his campaign pledge to end Ottawa's role in the air campaign altogether. And none of the Western allies appear eager to join the United States in basing warplanes at Incirlik air base in Turkey, a move that would make it easier to increase strikes against militants in northern Syria and Iraq.So far, eight Arab and Western allies have conducted about 5 percent of the 2,700 airstrikes in Syria, compared with 30 percent of the 5,100 strikes in Iraq, where many NATO partners also fly missions against the Islamic State. But the United States was always likely to fly the majority of the missions in Syria, as it does in Iraq, since its air forces are much larger than those of the Arab states or any forces deployed by Western allies.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter has promised Congress that the air war in Syria will escalate ""with a higher and heavier rate of strikes,"" including more attacks against top Islamic State leaders and oil fields that remain one of the group's main financial lifelines. But the revamped effort is already facing challenges.For the first time since 2007, the United States does not have an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf and will not again until mid-December; the Navy needed time to conduct badly needed repairs on its fleet. The aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and its air wing, responsible for about 10 percent of the daily strikes in Iraq and Syria, left the gulf in early October. France said on Thursday that it would send its only aircraft carrier to the gulf to help fill the gap.General Brown said the coalition could also pick up the slack using land-based American and allied warplanes, including a dozen A-10 ground-attack planes newly deployed to Incirlik air base, and a dozen F-15's on their way there.Incirlik is far more convenient to the fight -- 15 minutes flight time to the Syrian border compared with nearly five hours from Persian Gulf bases -- making it easier to increase the number of planes that can spend more time hunting Islamic State targets. But Australia and most of the European allies are reluctant to leave their bases in the Middle East, despite the shorter flight times.""It's not just as simple as, 'go to Turkey,' "" Gen. John R. Allen, the special American envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State, told Congress last month. ""They've got bilateral relationships in the gulf that are old, and have been cultivated in order for them to deploy.""So while France will still conduct airstrikes in Syria -- it has carried out about 270 strikes in Iraq and Syria over all, though only two so far in eastern Syria, a senior French official said -- it will continue to fly out of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, at least for now. The Australians will continue F/A-18 combat missions over Syria that began on Sept. 11, expanding beyond strikes in Iraq. But they, too, do not want to give up their base in the United Arab Emirates.Britain has talked tough about going after the Islamic State, but unlike France, its actions have not matched its talk. Britain currently flies bombing missions over Iraq and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance flights over Syria.The British defense and foreign secretaries have said they want forces to be able to fight the Islamic State in Syria as well as in Iraq, and that it is absurd to stop planes at a border that the militant group does not recognize, especially since its command centers are in Syria. But stung by Britain's experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan in support of American wars, Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to seek the approval of Parliament before taking any military action in Syria. He has said that he will only press for such a vote if he has ""a clear majority"" in favor, and so far he has failed to find one.The recent election of the hard-left Jeremy Corbyn as the leader of the Labour Party and Russia's military intervention in Syria have made it even less likely that Mr. Cameron will call for a vote.While some Iraqi and Western experts have criticized the pace of the air campaign, General Brown described two broad areas where he expected attacks against the Islamic State to increase in the coming days. First, he said, newly armed Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters would put pressure on Islamic State fighters in and around Raqqa, the group's self-proclaimed capital, forcing them to move from their defensive positions.""When they are active and moving, that increases our activity for strikes,"" said General Brown. ""Daesh presents itself as a target more.""This is what happened in July, when a Kurdish offensive in northeastern Syria yielded about a dozen strikes a day. But some Kurdish fighters ran low on ammunition, bad weather set in at times, and American commanders focused on targets in western Iraq, reducing strikes in Syria last month to just four a day.The general said the campaign would also intensify attacks on a second set of targets -- fixed sites such as oil-production facilities, bomb-making factories and other so-called critical nodes that support the Islamic State's war effort.Shifting more reconnaissance and surveillance planes to Incirlik to linger over targets longer will also help. Last month, American forces dropped bombs on 67 percent of their strike missions, up from about 25 percent a year ago -- a sign there are more targets to hit.""What I want to have,"" General Brown said, ""is a steady of set of strikes that keeps the pressure on Daesh.""",1.0
Turkish Troops Enter Iraq in Pursuit of Kurdish Rebels:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Turkish ground troops entered northern Iraq on Tuesday, seeking to capture Kurdish rebels who had crossed the border after a rebel attack in Turkey over the weekend killed 16 soldiers, a government official in Turkey said.Demonstrators angry over that attack, and a bombing that killed 14 police officers on Tuesday in eastern Turkey, filled streets in Istanbul and elsewhere. Furious crowds attacked newspapers and the offices of a pro-Kurdish political party, the Reuters news agency reported, prompting Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu to appeal for calm.""I invite all my citizens with hearts full of love for the country to calm, embrace one another, and to have confidence in the state,"" he said Tuesday on Twitter.The tensions escalated as the military pursued militants from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K., the government official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with protocol.The operation's size was not immediately clear, but the Dogan news agency, citing military sources, said two battalions had entered northern Iraq.On Monday, Turkish warplanes struck Kurdish insurgent targets in northern Iraq and killed dozens of rebels.P.K.K. rebels were believed to be behind a roadside bombing in Igdir Province that killed 14 police officers on Tuesday, the semiofficial Anadolu Agency reported. Several other police officers were wounded in the assault.In a separate attack on Tuesday, rocket-propelled grenades wounded at least four police officers in Cizre, a southeastern town, the local news media reported.Violence in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern part of Turkey has escalated since the insurgents killed at least 16 soldiers on Sunday, the deadliest attack since the collapse of a two-year cease-fire in July.The Kurdish group, which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, has been attacking Turkish security officials almost daily since the breakdown of the fragile peace process.Turkish officials say the group has killed at least 100 members of the security forces since July.After the attack on Sunday, Mr. Davutoglu vowed to eradicate the fighters from their mountain strongholds in Turkey and northern Iraq. ""These terrorists must be wiped out from the mountains; whatever happens, they must be wiped out,"" he said Monday in the capital, Ankara.""The mountains of this country must not be handed over to terrorists,"" he added. ""Every effort will be undertaken.""The Turkish military then struck 20 Kurdish targets late Monday in northern Iraq, killing at least 35 fighters, Anadolu reported.As the unrest spread to the streets on Monday and Tuesday, nationalist mobs attacked dozens of buildings belonging to the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party. On Tuesday night, a crowd attacked its headquarters in Ankara as well, the party said.Thousands of people took to the streets across Turkey to protest the attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party and call for peace.The Peoples' Democratic Party won representation in Parliament for the first time in a June 7 election by passing a 10 percent threshold, a factor in the governing Justice and Development Party's loss of its parliamentary majority for the first time in more than a decade.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"Close to 8,000 Have Been Killed in Ukraine Conflict, United Nations Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"GENEVA -- Nearly 8,000 people have died in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the United Nations said Tuesday in a report blaming the continuing influx of fighters and weaponry from Russia as the major obstacle to peace.At least 7,962 people have been killed and 17,811 wounded in the fighting that erupted in April 2014, the United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, said in a statement issued with the latest report by his agency's monitors in Ukraine.They said more than 400 civilians had been killed or wounded in artillery exchanges in the three most recent months covered by the report, more than double the number in the preceding three months, and cited daily violations of the cease-fire accord negotiated in February in Minsk, Belarus, between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian groups controlling large portions of eastern Ukraine.""The major impediments"" to peace are the presence of foreign fighters, the flow of sophisticated and heavy weaponry from Russia, and Ukraine's lack of control over its eastern border with Russia, the report said.The report, covering the months up to Aug. 15, was issued as the Ukrainian and Russian authorities described a downturn in fighting since a new truce began at the start of September.A Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters in Moscow that there was ""practically no shelling"" of civilian areas in the east by Ukrainian forces, while the Ukrainian defense minister, Col. Gen. Stepan Poltorak, said attacks on Ukrainian forces were down to two to four daily, the lowest level in a year and a half, the news media reported.However, Mr. Peskov added that there had been no progress on other aspects of the Minsk accord, which also calls for greater autonomy for eastern Ukraine and amnesty for fighters.United Nations monitors reported allegations of summary killings by pro-Russian armed groups and of torture, abductions and sexual violence by both sides in the conflict.The United Nations said the Ukrainian authorities were introducing legislation to comply with the Minsk accord, while armed groups controlling areas around Donetsk and Luhansk were setting up law enforcement, judicial and legislative bodies and issuing their own passports that did not conform to either international law or Ukrainian legislation.""Implementation of the Minsk agreement is key, and right now what we see is one side trying to do that and others moving away from it,"" Gianni Magazzeni, a senior United Nations human rights official, told reporters in Geneva.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

U.S. Moves to Block Russian Military Buildup in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The United States on Tuesday moved to head off preparations for a suspected Russian military buildup in Syria as Bulgaria agreed to an appeal from the Obama administration to shut its airspace to Russian transport planes. The planes' destination was the Syrian port city of Latakia.The administration has also asked Greece to close its airspace to the Russian flights, Greek and American officials said, but Greece has not publicly responded to the request.The apparent Russian military preparations and the Obama administration's attempt to block them have escalated long-running tensions between the White House and the Kremlin. Although the United States and Russia agree that the Islamic State is a threat, the new dispute shows that they remain far apart on how best to combat the militant group and on the political future of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria -- divisions that are likely to be on display when President Obama and President Vladimir V. Putin speak to the United Nations General Assembly this month.The administration's concerns were fueled last week by intelligence reports indicating that Russia appeared to be making preparations to deploy advisers and military personnel to an airfield south of Latakia and might also bring in aircraft and fly airstrikes from there. Those preparations included the delivery of prefabricated housing for as many as 1,000 personnel and a portable air traffic control station to the airfield.Over the weekend, two giant Russian Condor transport planes ferried more supplies and equipment from an air base in southern Russia across Iran and Iraq to Latakia, according to an American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was discussing intelligence reports.A Russian troop transport plane, probably an Ilyushin model, also landed at the same airfield in Latakia over the weekend. That aircraft, which flew over Greece and Bulgaria, is believed to have carried Russian military personnel.""They're clearly establishing some sort of forward operating base,"" the American official said.There have also been unconfirmed sightings of Russian Spetsnaz special forces at the Syrian Naval Academy, officials said.Providing a benign explanation for the operations, the Russian news media has suggested that the planes were carrying humanitarian assistance. That is the same rationale Russia used to explain convoys that are believed to have delivered military supplies to Ukrainian separatists and that Iran has used to fly arms to Damascus to support the Assad government.Bulgarian officials said on Tuesday that they had closed their nation's airspace to Russian transport planes through Sept. 24.""The reason for the refusal is associated with incorrect information in the requests to fly over the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria regarding the purpose of the flights and the cargo,"" Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.While Bulgaria's move will block one of the major air routes from Russia to Greece, it does not fully resolve the issue since Russia may still be able to continue its flights over Iran and Iraq. There is also a route from Russia to Syria over Turkey, but Russians avoid Turkish airspace because they fear the Turks will force a Russian military plane to land, as they have in the past.State Department officials declined to discuss publicly what requests have been made to foreign governments to close their airspace to Russian aircraft, citing the need to maintain the confidentiality of diplomatic communications. But the officials made clear they were pressing the issue.""We have encouraged our allies and partners to ask tough questions of Russia's increased military deployments to Syria,"" said John Kirby, the State Department spokesman.At the least, the flights have highlighted the deepening differences between the United States and Russia over Syria. While the Obama administration has argued that Mr. Assad's brutal crackdown against his opponents fueled the sectarian passions that strengthened the Islamic State, the Russians still appear to see the Syrian president as a bulwark against extremists, at least for now.Western officials say that Russia's intentions are not entirely clear. Although Mr. Putin spoke in Vladivostok last week about the need to form a coalition against the Islamic State, Iran and the Syrian government appear to be the only potential members so far.One possibility is that Russia is not only trying to support the Syrian government but is trying to expand its role inside Syria so it can influence the choice of a new Syrian government in case Mr. Assad is ousted. Another theory is that Russia is putting itself in a position to defend a rump state should Mr. Assad be driven from Damascus and find refuge in a stronghold near the coast. None of these possibilities are mutually exclusive.On Saturday Mr. Kerry called Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and warned Russia not to expand its military role in Syria. On Monday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lavrov said that the Kremlin had long provided military assistance to the Syrian government in its fight against extremists and expressed surprise at Mr. Kerry's warning.But on Tuesday, Mr. Kirby repeated the criticism of Russia's role.""Russia is not a member of the coalition against ISIL, and what we've said is that their continued support to the Assad regime has actually fostered the growth of ISIL inside Syria and made the situation worse,"" he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State. ""If they want to be helpful against ISIL, the way to do it is to stop arming and assisting and supporting Bashar al-Assad.""Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"After Fatal Attack, Turkey Strikes at Kurdish Rebels:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"ISTANBUL -- The Turkish military carried out airstrikes against Kurdish insurgents on Monday, a day after what appeared to be the deadliest rebel assault since the breakdown in July of a fragile peace process with the Turkish state.The death toll from Sunday's attack was not clear. The military put the figure at 16, with six more wounded, but a website close to the Kurdistan Workers' Party said that 31 soldiers had been killed. Turkish fighter jets struck 23 targets in retaliation, the military said.The clashes signaled an escalation in violence in Turkey's southeast, where Kurdish militants have resumed an insurgency against the Turkish state that has claimed nearly 40,000 lives over three decades.On Monday, the military said it had launched airstrikes on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party in response to the ambush by militants in the Daglica area of Hakkari Province, close to the border with Iraq. There were no immediate reports of deaths.The airstrikes came after two armored vehicles suffered heavy damage on Sunday from handmade explosives, the military said in a statement, which noted ""martyrs and wounded among our heroic armed comrades.""Government officials said that more than 70 members of the Turkish security forces had been killed since the end of a cease-fire in July. In response to the daily attacks by the Kurdish militants, Turkish officials have called on the Kurdistan Workers' Party leadership to reinstate the cease-fire and withdraw from Turkey as a first step toward disarmament.In 2013, Turkey reached a historic settlement with the Kurdish militias, vowing to grant the Kurdish minority greater rights and autonomy in exchange for the cease-fire, which brought peace and stability to the volatile southeast.Elections are scheduled for Nov. 1, with Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's Justice and Development Party hoping to regain the majority it lost in a June 7 vote. Opponents say the government's decision to resume extensive military operations against the Kurdistan Workers' Party is driven at least in part by a calculated strategy by the Justice and Development Party to recapture the nationalist vote.Commenting on the unrest in a television interview on Sunday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the situation would be different if Turks had voted for 400 lawmakers from a single party in the June election, referring to the number of seats the Justice and Development Party would need to secure an absolute majority to change the Constitution.He vowed that Turkey would continue its military operations against the Kurdish militants ""until the end."" He said 2,000 militants had been killed so far.After the attack on Sunday, Mr. Davutoglu left early from a soccer match between Turkey and the Netherlands in the city of Konya and returned to Ankara to convene an emergency security meeting. No statements were made.On Monday, Mr. Erdogan said the attack had been aimed at breaking up the country's unity.""I believe that the Turkish nation will maintain a united and determined stance against attacks that aim to damage peace, security and stability of the country,"" he said in a statement.Selahattin Demirtas, co-chairman of the pro-Kurdish Democratic People's Party, whose success in the June election stripped Justice and Development of its majority, condemned the attack and the government's policy toward the Kurds.""As killing has no justification; leading our people to death has no justification either,"" he said on Twitter.

Britain Says First Drone Strike in Syria Hit ISIS Suspects:   [Foreign Desk ],,"LONDON -- Crossing a significant threshold in its battle with jihadist groups, Britain announced on Monday that it had conducted an armed drone strike for the first time inside Syria, killing three suspected members of the Islamic State, including two British citizens.In a statement to Parliament, Prime Minister David Cameron said that a British man, Reyaad Khan, had been identified as a terrorist threat and was killed on Aug. 21 in an operation in which two associates, including another Briton, identified as Ruhul Amin, also died.Mr. Cameron's announcement came as France said it would start sending reconnaissance flights over Syria and was considering airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syrian territory.The British government's decision to order a lethal drone strike against a terrorism suspect in another country -- an action long practiced by the United States -- is a significant step, raising questions about the scope of British operations in the Middle East.Britain is not taking part in military action in Syria, because lawmakers rejected that idea two years ago, although both Britain and France are involved in the American-led campaign to strike Islamic State targets in Iraq.The Aug. 21 strike appeared to bring British policy closer to that of the Americans, who in a 2011 drone strike targeted and killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born jihadist preacher.British officials did not offer a specific explanation for the delay of more than two weeks in reporting the lethal drone operation. Nor did they explain precisely how they knew two of the victims were Britons.""This announcement by the prime minister is a big departure in a number of ways,"" said Michael Clarke, director general of the Royal United Services Institute, a research organization that specializes in defense issues, who noted that Britain had so far promised not to conduct military operations in Syria.In addition, Mr. Clarke said, ""this drone strike is the first to have been conducted, apparently, as a targeted assassination.""Speaking to lawmakers, Mr. Cameron justified the action on the grounds that Mr. Khan, 21, and another Briton, Junaid Hussain, had sought ""to orchestrate specific and barbaric attacks,"" including terrorism in Britain. Mr. Hussain was reported killed in an American drone strike on Aug. 24.Mr. Cameron was vague about the precise threat posed, though he said it included ""directing a number of planned terrorist attacks right here in Britain, such as plots to attack high-profile public commemorations, including those taking place this summer.""Several weeks ago, one British newspaper suggested that the queen might be a terrorism target when she attended the ceremony to commemorate the end of World War II in Japan, though this commemoration took place on the weekend before the lethal British drone strike.Mr. Cameron said six plots by Islamic extremists had been thwarted this year and described the killings as an ""act of self-defense,"" taken after ""meticulous planning.""However, the acting leader of the opposition Labour Party, Harriet Harman, questioned the legality of the strike and urged the government to publish the legal advice, something it said it did not plan to do.The decision to target Mr. Khan was made in the country's National Security Council, at a meeting attended by Mr. Cameron, his office said. Approval for the specific operation that killed Mr. Khan was given by the defense secretary, Michael Fallon.""We took this action because there was no alternative,"" Mr. Cameron told lawmakers. ""In this area, there is no government we can work with.""We have no military on the ground to detain those preparing plots.""Mr. Cameron also said that the British attorney general had been consulted and that Britain was exercising its ""inherent right to self-defense.""His announcement came as diplomatic discussions have intensified over the conflict in Syria, a primary cause of the growing refugee crisis in Europe. Many of the thousands now fleeing for safety in European countries are Syrians.Since its election in May, the British government has been expected to make another attempt to get the approval of lawmakers for military action in Syria.Mr. Clarke said that the drone killings ""will be regarded as jumping the parliamentary gun"" in announcing that British air power had already been used to bomb something on the ground inside Syria, adding that this may prove to be a ""high-risk strategy.""Brendan O'Hara, who speaks for the Scottish National Party on defense, added that ""the case for bombing in Syria has simply not been made -- and any involvement of British service personnel in bombing without the approval of Parliament clearly flouts the democratic decision taken by the House of Commons.""The French decision to at least begin surveillance missions over Syria was announced by President François Hollande at a news conference in Paris.""Depending on the information that we will have gathered, the intelligence that we will have collected and the reconnaissance that we will have done, we will be ready to conduct airstrikes,"" Mr. Hollande said.Sending French troops to Syria was ""unrealistic"" and ""reckless,"" Mr. Hollande said, and he ruled out ordering any ground forces to Syria or Iraq, where he said France had already conducted 200 airstrikes.Asked about reports that Russia was bolstering military support for the government of Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, Mr. Hollande said that Russia was committed to a political solution of the Syria conflict, now in its fifth year.Although Russia is an ally of Syria, Mr. Hollande said, Russia would not offer unwavering support to Mr. Assad himself.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

U.S. to Revamp a Rebel Force Combating ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- In an acknowledgment of severe shortcomings in its effort to create a force of moderate rebels to battle the Islamic State in Syria, the Pentagon is drawing up plans to significantly revamp the program by dropping larger numbers of fighters into safer zones as well as providing better intelligence and improving their combat skills.The proposed changes come after a Syrian affiliate of Al Qaeda attacked, in late July, many of the first 54 Syrian graduates of the military's training program and the rebel unit they came from. A day before the attack, two leaders of the American-backed group and several of its fighters were captured.The encounter revealed several glaring deficiencies in the program, according to classified assessments: The rebels were ill-prepared for an enemy attack and were sent back into Syria in too small numbers. They had no local support from the population and had poor intelligence about their foes. They returned to Syria during the Eid holiday, and many were allowed to go on leave to visit relatives, some in refugee camps in Turkey -- and these movements likely tipped off adversaries to their mission. Others could not return because border crossings were closed.The classified options now circulating at senior levels of the Pentagon include enlarging the size of the groups of trained rebels sent back into Syria, shifting the location of the deployments to ensure local support, and improving intelligence provided to the fighters. No decisions have been made on specific proposals, according to four senior Defense Department and Obama administration officials briefed on the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential planning.""As with any difficult endeavor, we expected setbacks and successes, and we must be realistic with those expectations,"" Capt. Chris Connolly, a spokesman for the American military task force training the Syrian rebels, said in an email. ""We knew this mission was going to be difficult from the very beginning.""The Pentagon effort to salvage its flailing training program in Turkey and Jordan comes as the world is fixated on the plight of thousands of refugees seeking safety in Europe from strife in the Middle East, including many fleeing violence of the Syrian civil war and oppression in areas under the control of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. Officials in Washington and European capitals acknowledge that halting this mass migration requires a comprehensive international effort to bring peace and stability to areas that those refugees are now fleeing.The 54 Syrian fighters supplied by the Syrian opposition group Division 30 were the first group of rebels deployed under a $500 million train-and-equip program authorized by Congress last year. It is an overt program run by United States Special Forces, with help from other allied military trainers, and is separate from a parallel covert program run by the C.I.A.After a year of trying, however, the Pentagon is still struggling to find recruits to fight the Islamic State without also battling the forces of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, their original adversary.The willing few face screening, but it is so stringent that only dozens have been approved from among the thousands who have applied, and they are bit players in the rebellion. The program has not engaged with the biggest, most powerful groups, Islamist factions that are better funded, better equipped and more motivated. Even the program's largest supporters now concede that the goal of generating more than 5,000 trained fighters in the first year of the program is unrealistic.With the White House ruling out sending American advisers into Syria with the trainees, the biggest challenge may be deciding where and how to send the rebels back in.""We don't have direct command and control with those forces once we do finish training and equipping them when we put them back into the fight,"" Brig. Gen. Kevin J. Killea, chief of staff for the American-led military operation fighting the Islamic State, told reporters in a video teleconference at the Pentagon last Friday. ""If I had to point to a place where we could explore better lessons learned, that would be it.""At least one part of the training program worked well: the ability to provide real-time air cover for the rebels once back inside Syria. Predator drones quickly rushed to help the Division 30 fighters once they came under attack from the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, killing dozens of the attackers, American officials said. Nonetheless, Pentagon planners are reviewing their support for rebels both before and after they are sent back to the battlefield, to see how it can be improved.Two Syrian rebel commanders interviewed recently in Turkey with fighters in the United States program described an initiative that had struggled from the start.The group meant to accept the training program's graduates, Division 30, was created from scratch earlier this year, and commanders of mostly small fighting groups from different parts of Syria were asked to submit names of fighters for training.While most of the fighters were Sunni Arabs, Nadim Hassan, an ethnic Turkmen whom few people had heard of before, was named as its leader, a decision many rebels felt had been imposed by the Turkish government.Some commanders were eager to participate. ""It was supposed to be an organized army where no one had benefits over anyone else,"" said Abdul-Razaq Freiji, who had defected from the Syrian Army early in the uprising and led a small fighting group near the central city of Hama. ""We are military men and we like order, so we wanted training and organization.""The trainees were to get good weapons and monthly salaries ranging from $225 for soldiers to $350 for officers, Mr. Freiji said.The participating rebel commanders submitted lists of their fighters for training, but many were surprised by how few were accepted. Mr. Freiji submitted 1,100 names, but only 42 of his men were accepted initially.The number of participants dwindled further after training began. Some recruits were sent home because they had come with fake identification cards, were under 18, or did not give proper answers when asked about the Islamic State, Mr. Freiji said.Trainees learned to use American-issued M16 assault rifles, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. Some were trained as snipers, while others were taught to identify targets for airstrikes by the American-led military coalition that is fighting the Islamic State.On his phone, Mr. Freiji flipped through photos of skinny trainees in clean military uniforms wielding their new weapons. But new problems arose after the class of 54 graduated in July.About a dozen returned to Syria to visit their families and were detained by the Nusra Front, Mr. Freiji said. While some have since been released, the episode emphasized how vulnerable the young recruits were to battle-hardened militants who have now been fighting in Syria for years.Division 30's leaders recognized this, so on July 30, Mr. Hassan, the group's leader, and another commander, Farhan Jassem, entered Syria to meet with Nusra Front leaders and assure them that the American-trained force intended to fight only the Islamic State, according to Mr. Freiji and another Division 30 commander who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize his relationship with the Americans.Soon after entering Syria, the two men and six others were promptly captured by the Nusra Front. They are still being held.The next day, the Nusra Front attacked Division 30's base in the village of Mariameen in northwestern Syria, an effort it said was to stop the American program before it could get a foothold in the country.Mr. Freiji was in Turkey at the time but showed a text chat on his phone with a commander who was inside the base at the time. ""We are surrounded,"" the commander in Syria wrote.Mr. Freiji called his liaison with the Americans and waited. More than two hours later, an American drone struck the Nusra fighters. A black-and-white video on his phone, apparently shot by an American drone, showed dozens of fighters he said were from the Nusra Front approaching the base before a large blast hit them, followed by automatic fire from the sky.A handful of Division 30 fighters were killed in the clash. One trainee was wounded and sent to a hospital, where he disappeared, presumably captured by the jihadists, Mr. Freiji said. Dozens of Nusra fighters were killed in the strikes, ending the battle.That attack threw the effort into disarray, with Division 30 fighters scattered inside of Syria and across the border in Turkey. ""The Americans made the mistake,"" Mr. Freiji said. ""You can't send in a group that small into Syria.""He was still waiting to hear from the Americans how future graduates would be sent into Syria and protected.Mr. Freiji said a number of trained Division 30 fighters recently joined other rebels in Marea, a village north of Aleppo that the Islamic State has been trying to capture for some time. He said the others welcomed the Division 30 fighters because they had been trained to call in coalition airstrikes.The other commander involved with Division 30, who has dozens of fighters currently in training, said that instead of sending his fighters to the front lines to battle the Islamic State, he planned to send them to their original base, where they would be safe until the Americans had a convincing plan to protect them.""We have to work with the reality that exists, not dreams and ideas,"" the commander said.",1.0
Saudi Officials Say 10 Soldiers Slain in Yemen:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- A spokesman for Saudi Arabia's military said Saturday that 10 Saudi soldiers were killed in a rebel missile strike a day earlier in Yemen, raising the death toll from the attack to at least 60.It was the first public acknowledgment by the Saudis that they have ground troops in Yemen, where they are leading a coalition to roll back gains by the Shiite rebels known as Houthis and their allies.The United Arab Emirates said 45 of its soldiers were killed in the attack on Friday, when rebels hit an ammunition depot in Marib Province, about 75 miles east of the capital, Sana. It was the deadliest day for the military in the nation's 44-year history.In a statement, the Saudi spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, said, ""Ten Saudi soldiers from the Arab coalition forces were martyred"" in the attack on the weapons depot.Bahrain, another member of the coalition, said Friday that five of its soldiers also had been killed.The Saudi-led coalition, which is backed by the United States, is made up mainly of Persian Gulf nations. It has been carrying out airstrikes against the rebels since March.Before Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Bahrain confirmed the casualties in the attack in Marib, coalition countries had avoided acknowledging that they had troops in Yemen.Yemeni security officials have said that Saudi, Emirati, Egyptian and Jordanian military advisers are training hundreds of fighters at a military base in Aden. The Saudis are also supplying weapons and providing military advice in the fight for control of Yemen.The rebels and army units loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh are fighting forces loyal to President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who is in self-imposed exile in Saudi Arabia, as well as southern separatists and local militias.Officials from the Houthi news office confirmed that they had fired a missile in Marib, which had been a staging ground for what pro-government forces described as a coming assault on the Houthis' strongholds.",1.0
World Briefing | Europe; Turkey: Troops in Iraq Withdrawn:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Turkey on Monday withdrew some troops that had been sent to the outskirts of Mosul in northern Iraq to support a training mission, a deployment that had set off an angry reaction in Baghdad, where the authorities said they had never agreed to host Turkish forces.Turkey has been training Kurdish pesh merga forces and Sunni Arab fighters -- mostly policemen who fled Mosul's capture last year by the Islamic State -- in northern Iraq for nearly a year, but with the permission of only the local Kurdish government, not Baghdad.When Turkey recently sent a new detachment of troops, with armored vehicles and tanks, to a camp in Bashiqa, near Mosul, it set off protests throughout Iraq. Demonstrators burned Turkish flags recently at gatherings in Baghdad and other cities, and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, saying the troops infringed on Iraqi sovereignty, vowed to seek action by the United Nations Security Council to force out the Turkish troops.The episode has highlighted how divided Iraq is, and showed the weakness of the central government and its lack of control over its territory.After talks last week between Turkish and Iraqi leaders, including a visit to Baghdad by Turkey's intelligence chief, many of the Turkish troops who had recently been sent to northern Iraq -- but apparently not all -- were withdrawn on Monday. Turkish officials had said the troops had been sent to protect military trainers from a rising threat of attacks by the Islamic State, and on Monday the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency said some were withdrawn out of ""military necessity.""It was unclear if the withdrawal was enough to defuse tensions with Baghdad, and there was no statement on Monday from Mr. Abadi. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke Monday with Turkey's prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, and a statement issued by the White House said Mr. Biden ""welcomed reports of the withdrawal of Turkish troops out of Camp Bashiqa as an important step to de-escalate recent tensions.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
"Violence Escalates in Yemen as Islamic State Gains Strength, Challenging Al Qaeda:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SANA, Yemen -- Nine months of war between a Saudi-led military coalition and a Yemeni rebel group have left thousands of civilians dead, a nation gravely polarized and the land strewn with debris, mines and unexploded bombs.The conflict has produced another bitter legacy: a new branch of the Islamic State that has quietly grown in strength and appears determined to distinguish itself as Yemen's most disruptive and brutal force, carrying out attacks considered too extreme even by the country's branch of Al Qaeda.The Islamic State's deadliest assaults, on mosques here in the capital, killed more than 130 people and helped start Yemen's civil war in March. In recent weeks, the group has carried out powerful car bombings in southern Yemen and released videos filled with grisly executions and sectarian denunciations of Yemen's Shiite minority. The violence has raised tensions before United Nations-brokered negotiations to end the conflict, scheduled to begin this week in Geneva, as well as a cease-fire announced by the Saudi-led coalition that is set to begin Tuesday.Like Islamic State affiliates in Egypt and Libya, the Yemeni group has shown signs it is more closely coordinating its activities with the headquarters in Syria, analysts said. And its emergence has only added to the peril from Sunni extremism in Yemen, already home to a powerful branch of Al Qaeda that has been able to seize territory during the latest conflict, including Al Mukalla, the country's fifth-largest city.American intelligence and counterterrorism analysts say the Qaeda affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, remains the most urgent militant threat in this fractured country. But they are closely watching the effort by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, to peel off defectors from Al Qaeda's wing here.""The pace of its attacks and declarations of new provinces during the past year underscores the group's ambitions in Yemen,"" said an American counterterrorism official, referring to the Islamic State. ""While some may not consider ISIL's Yemen affiliate to be as worrying as the group's other hubs, there are a number of factors that indicate the branch should be taken seriously in the long term.""An analyst in Yemen who closely follows Sunni extremist groups in the country said the scale of the attacks by the Islamic State showed that it was becoming just as dangerous as Al Qaeda. At the start of Yemen's civil war, the Islamic State's presence was ""limited,"" said the analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the hazards of talking openly about the group.As the war has spread across Yemen and the violence intensifies, the group's ""recruiting circle is expanding,"" he added.The Saudi-led coalition said on Monday that its forces would cease fighting for seven days, beginning on Tuesday, in order to ""create the atmosphere for the success"" of the negotiations in Geneva, according to a statement carried by the official Saudi news agency. Past cease-fires during the war have been marred by violations and frequently led to an escalation of the fighting.Both the Islamic State and Al Qaeda have profited from a security vacuum while trying to rally Yemen's Sunnis against the Shiite-led rebels, known as the Houthis, who are from the north, analysts say. Crucially, the groups have both faced little or no resistance from the Saudi-led coalition and its allies, which are focused on defeating the Houthis. The coalition receives backing from the United States and Britain.This month, Qaeda militants were able to capture two towns in southern Yemen with little effort, residents said. In some cities, including Aden and Taiz, small numbers of hard-line Sunni militants continue to fight alongside the Saudis and their allies.At the same time, Yemeni officials with the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by the Saudi-led coalition, have appeared to underestimate the threat posed by the Islamic State -- or even deny its existence.Last week, when the Islamic State claimed responsibility for killing the provincial governor of Aden and eight of his bodyguards with a car bomb -- releasing both a statement and photographs of the attack -- the city's security director, Mohamed Mousaed, insisted that ""remnants of the Houthis and Saleh"" had carried out the bombing. Yemen's former president Ali Abdullah Saleh is allied with the rebels.Nadwa al-Dawsari, a Yemeni analyst and nonresident fellow at the Project on Middle East Democracy in Washington, said there was a widespread perception in southern Yemen that the threat from the Islamic State was ""manufactured."" That perception was fueled by the group's ""invisibility,"" as well as Mr. Saleh's well-documented history of manipulating extremist groups for his own ends, including to win financial and military support from the United States for counterterrorism operations, she said.But whether the Islamic State has grown organically or not, ""the threat is real and the threat is strong,"" Ms. Dawsari said.The group has sent suicide bombers to attack mosques in Sana, which is controlled by the Houthis. In the past few weeks, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for car bombings in Aden, including an attack on a hotel hosting members of Mr. Hadi's government and another at a headquarters for the Saudi-led coalition.A video released recently by the branch underscored its determination to showcase its brutality. In one section, the video shows masked gunmen leading prisoners to a small boat that was set out to sea and then blown up. Another vignette showed four captives made to wear what appeared to be mortar shells, draped around their necks, then pose for the camera before the shells were detonated.The governor of Aden, Jaafar Mohamed Saad, was the highest-ranking official killed by the group since the emergence of the Islamic State in Yemen about a year ago. The relative ease of the attack showed a failure ""to establish security in the south, despite a huge opportunity,"" Ms. Dawsari said.The Saudi-led coalition sent thousands of troops to drive the Houthis out of Aden and other southern provinces in July. But afterward, a decree issued by Mr. Hadi to integrate local resistance groups into the armed forces was not carried out, Ms. Dawsari said.""The presence of foreign troops hasn't been helpful, except for keeping Saleh and the Houthis from coming back,"" she said. ""Aden does not need foreign troops for security. It needs local security structures and police forces.""The struggles by the coalition to establish security and stem the growth of the militant groups could carry consequences beyond Yemen's borders, according to security analysts.""The assassinations and other violence show that ISIS has gained power,"" said Matthew G. Olsen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington. ""There's real concern that some of the most capable operational terrorists, who are now with A.Q.A.P., could join forces with ISIS and pose a heightened threat to carry out external attacks,"" he said, using an acronym for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.Others said defections from Al Qaeda were already gathering steam. ""There are large numbers of both leaders and individuals joining the Islamic State,"" said a former member of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who has left the group but remains close to its members. Many of the defectors, he said, were hard-line jihadists and young militants frustrated with Al Qaeda's failure to be more aggressive during the current war.But the militants of the Islamic State, he said, ""follow their words with actions.""",1.0
Run-In With Turkish Fishing Boat Angers Russian Military:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- Russia summoned a Turkish military attaché on Sunday to warn of what it called provocations by a Turkish fishing boat near a Russian warship in the Aegean Sea.The warship fired warning shots after the fishing boat did not heed calls to change course when it sailed within about 1,600 feet of the Smetlivy destroyer, one of the ships supporting Russia's military intervention in Syria, the Russian Defense Ministry said.Russia told the Turkish military attaché of ""potentially disastrous consequences from Ankara's reckless actions toward Russia's military contingent fighting against international terrorism in Syria,"" the Defense Ministry said in a statement.It added that ""only by luck was tragedy avoided.""The episode seemed likely to heighten tensions between Russia and Turkey over the Syrian crisis and Turkey's shooting down of a Russian military jet last month. Turkey says Russia's air force is targeting ethnic Turkish villages in northern Syria amid its effort to prop up President Bashar al-Assad.The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, in Rome for talks about Libya, told reporters he did not want relations with Russia to worsen over the episode and said that ""we want to overcome tensions through dialogue.""",1.0
General to Investigate U.S. Airstrike on Doctors Without Borders Hospital:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. KABUL, Afghanistan -- With an initial military assessment confirming civilian casualties in the bombing of a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz by an American warplane, Gen. John F. Campbell, the American commander in Afghanistan, has appointed a two-star general from another command to conduct an independent investigation, his office said in a statement on Saturday.The announcement came as the death toll in the bombing, one of the worst episodes of civilian casualties in the Afghan war, rose once again, three weeks after the AC-130 gunship repeatedly bombed the trauma center in Kunduz after fighting the Taliban, who had overrun the city. Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French name, Médecins Sans Frontières, said the casualty figures now stood at 23 staff members and patients killed and three others missing who are presumed dead.Officials are trying to determine the identities of seven unrecognizable bodies found in the wreck of the hospital, all of whom have now been buried, the organization said in a statement on Saturday. The three missing people could be among them.A spokesman for General Campbell, Brig. Gen. Wilson Shoffner, said an assessment team had ""determined that the reports of civilian casualties were credible."" The investigation, which will be conducted by three senior officers outside General Campbell's command, will be led by Maj. Gen. William B. Hickman and supported by two brigadier generals.General Campbell, also the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, said: ""My intent is to disclose the findings of the investigation once it is complete. We will be forthright and transparent and we will hold ourselves accountable for any mistakes made.""But Doctors Without Borders sees the episode as a possible war crime, and neither the Pentagon's announcement that it would investigate nor an earlier apology from President Obama seems to have deterred the group's insistence on an international inquiry under the Geneva Conventions. Such an investigation, which requires the consent of the governments of the United States and Afghanistan, would be conducted by the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission, a body formed in 1991 but never used. Neither government is likely to approve such an inquiry.Jason Cone, the United States executive director of Doctors Without Borders, said that while the organization would cooperate with any investigation by the United States military or the NATO coalition, those would be ""rooted in the context of military doctrine and practice, not international humanitarian law.""""If international humanitarian law is flouted, if violations on this scale can be dismissed as a 'mistake,' 'the fog of war' or even just 'a terrible tragedy,' then all of our medical staff, projects and patients in conflict zones could be jeopardized,"" Mr. Cone wrote in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times on Saturday.As fighting intensified in northern Afghanistan this year, the group's 94-bed trauma center in Kunduz provided valuable medical services. Last year, the hospital treated more than 22,000 patients and conducted 5,900 operations, the statement said; what remains now are ""collapsed roofs, blackened walls, floors thick with dust and twisted pieces of metal that were once beds or trolleys."" The burden of providing medical assistance amid intense fighting has fallen to two Afghan health centers, low on staff, medicine and surgical capacity.""Until M.S.F. understands what happened on the night of the attack and has strong assurances that it cannot happen again, the Kunduz trauma center cannot be reopened,"" the statement added.Before he acknowledged that the United States military broke its own rules in calling in the airstrike, General Campbell and his staff shifted their response several times on why such a major hospital, which had repeatedly shared its exact coordinates as a humanitarian center with his forces, was struck so brutally. Doctors Without Borders has said the bombing continued for over an hour, despite desperate calls by employees to military offices in Kabul and Washington. The military's initial reaction to the airstrike said it was carried out against those ""threatening the force,"" a reference to a Special Operations unit deployed in the area to assist the Afghan forces. Later, General Campbell acknowledged that the strikes were called for by Afghan forces who had come under fire.Afghan officials, on the other hand, have continued to stick to the narrative that the Taliban were firing at their forces from the hospital grounds. As recently as last week, the acting minister of defense, Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, said the hospital was used as a ""safe place"" by the insurgents.The comments from Afghan officials came without a clear investigation on their side. While they have said a nongovernmental fact-finding mission set up to investigate the fall of Kunduz to the Taliban on Sept. 28 would also look into the hospital bombing, it is now clear that the mandate does not extend that far.""The mandate of the Kunduz fact-finding mission doesn't cover events beyond Sept. 28,"" said Amrullah Saleh, a former intelligence chief who is a leader of the mission. ""The team focuses on finding reasons for failure in leadership, structures and resources management.""Doctors Without Borders has expressed ""disgust"" at the claims that the hospital was used by the Taliban to fire on Afghan forces, saying such a narrative suggested ""that Afghan and U.S. forces working together decided to raze to the ground a fully functioning hospital.""",1.0
U.S. Soldier Dies in Raid to Free Prisoners of ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BAGHDAD -- An American soldier was killed in action in Iraq for the first time since the renewed military intervention here last year, during a Kurdish and United States commando raid to free prisoners being held by Islamic State militants on Thursday, the Pentagon said.The raid, near the northern town of Hawija, freed about 70 prisoners but not the group the soldiers had expected to find, American and Iraqi officials said. American officials said that five Islamic State fighters had been detained and that important intelligence about the terrorist group had been recovered.The raid was the first time American soldiers had been confirmed to be directly accompanying local forces in Iraq onto the battlefield against the Islamic State since President Obama sent troops back to the country last year. Until now, the American contingent, which numbers around 3,500, had been limited to training and advising the Iraqi and Kurdish forces on military bases and training areas. But senior American military officials have long signaled that they might ask the White House for permission to send small teams into the field with Iraqi forces for some important operations, such as the battle for Mosul.The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, said the United States was trying to help a loyal ally -- the Kurdish Regional Government -- and was also rushing to save lives.""This was a unique circumstance in which very close partners of the United States made a specific request for our assistance,"" he said. ""So I would not suggest that this is something that's going to now happen on a regular basis.""It was not, Mr. Cook insisted, a forerunner of a more aggressive posture in which American troops would regularly join the Iraqis on combat operations.The decision to use American helicopters to fly Kurdish commandos to Hawija, and to have American Special Operations forces join them in a supporting role, was taken by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter. The White House, Mr. Cook said, was informed in advance.Providing new details about the operation, American officials said on Thursday night that it had been mounted at the request of the Kurdish officials who insisted they had solid intelligence that the Islamic State was about to massacre prisoners, including a number of pesh merga fighters, as the Kurdish forces are known.""They were going with or without us,"" said a senior Defense Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a classified operation. ""We wanted to stand behind an important ally.""Fears that the prisoners were in danger may have been reinforced by the militants' actions in recent days. An Iraqi in the Hawija area, who asked not to be named because he feared retribution from the Islamic State, said this week that the militants had recently executed 11 young men who were the sons or relatives of police officers or other Iraqi forces. He said their bodies had been displayed on a nearby bridge.Five American helicopters were involved in the raid, a mix of Chinook and Black Hawk choppers. The American forces included commandos from the Delta Force counterterrorism unit, officials said.As the operation began, the United States conducted an airstrike to destroy a bridge near Hawija and hamper the Islamic State's ability to send reinforcements. But the operation soon became an intense firefight.Kurdish forces were to take the lead in the operation while American soldiers, who were to play a supporting role, initially were near a wall that was some distance from the objective, officials said.But the Kurds were pinned down by fire from the militants. So the Americans began to maneuver to relieve the pressure on their Kurdish allies and one of them was fatally wounded, said Col. Steven H. Warren, a spokesman for the American-led coalition in Iraq.When the prisoners were freed, the Kurds were surprised to see that no pesh merga fighters were among them. It is not clear whether the initial intelligence was bad or the Islamic State had moved the Kurds somewhere else.Instead of the about 20 prisoners the commandos had anticipated, there were 69, the Kurds said. They included more than 20 Iraqi security forces, some local residents and apparently some militants whom the Islamic State suspected as being traitors, according to American officials.Freed hostages have told Iraqi and American officials in Erbil, where they were taken, that they had been told they were to be executed at dawn on Thursday after the morning prayer. Trench graves had already been dug.As the American helicopters flew away, an American F-15 jet bombed the house that the Islamic State has used as its prison. Iraqis from the area said the building that the militants took over was owned by a local judge who had left the region.""They cut off roads and raided the place successfully,"" Najmaldin Karim, the governor of the surrounding Kirkuk Province, said in a telephone interview. ""They were able to take people with them.""Kurdish security officials said Thursday night in a statement that more than 20 militants had been killed in the firefight and that six militants, not the five reported by the United States, had been captured. The Kurdish statement said that three Kurdish commandos had been injured.A news agency linked with the Islamic State asserted that three militants who were defending the prison had been killed, and it said that Islamic State fighters had killed some of their prisoners.The operation comes as Iraq and the American-led coalition have been trying to regain the initiative, stepping up the pressure against the militants in Ramadi, Baiji and other areas in Iraq, as well as in Syria.Hawija is under the control of the Islamic State and has been an important flash point. Kurdish forces advanced toward the area in recent weeks and were said to have taken significant casualties, according to American officials.The raid may intensify the public debate in the United States over the Americans' military role in the region. The Obama administration has said that its goal is to degrade and ultimately defeat the Islamic State, but the campaign against the militants has progressed slowly.Some experts say there is no such thing as a risk-free conflict and that American teams will need to venture outside their bases to advise Iraqi forces if they are to evict the Islamic State from Iraq. Critics, however, are likely to portray the raid as a case of mission creep.The Pentagon has not yet named the soldier who was killed, a standard procedure until relatives are notified. Military personnel from other coalition nations have also been killed in the campaign against the Islamic State since its advance through Iraq last year. A Canadian soldier was killed in northern Iraq in March in a so-called friendly-fire incident involving Kurdish troops. And a Jordanian pilot was burned to death this year by the Islamic State after his plane crashed in Syria in December.While American commando operations have taken place in Syria, none had previously been confirmed to have happened n Iraq.",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; India: 6 Killed at Kashmir Outpost:   [Foreign Desk ],,"NEW DELHI -- Two heavily armed militants wearing Indian Army uniforms opened fire on a police station near the Pakistani border early Friday, killing three Indian security personnel and a civilian, officials said.The attack, for which Indian officials blamed Pakistan, was the first since a new coalition government took power in the disputed Kashmir region earlier this month. It could sway a debate over whether to overturn a contentious law that gives Indian security forces wide latitude to use force in the region without fear of prosecution.Members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, which makes up part of Jammu and Kashmir State's new governing coalition, have opposed lifting the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, and the attack Friday could provide them with further justification for their stance.""Our neighbor is not rectifying their ways,"" Jitendra Singh, a junior minister in Mr. Modi's office, said after the attack, referring to Pakistan.The police station, which is about 10 miles from the heavily guarded Pakistani border, came under attack from two militants dressed in Indian battle fatigues who opened fire with Kalishnikov rifles, officials said. ""They asked the guard to open the door and immediately shot him dead,"" Danish Rana, a police inspector general, told reporters.

More U.S. Troops Seen Staying in Afghanistan:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is nearing a decision to keep more troops in Afghanistan next year than it had intended, effectively upending its drawdown plans in response to roiling violence in the country and another false start in the effort to open peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government.As recently as last month, American officials had hoped that a renewed push to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table would yield the beginnings of a peace process and allow the United States to stick with its plan to drop the number of troops in Afghanistan from just under 10,000 to about 5,600 by the end of the year.But those hopes have been dashed by signs that the Taliban remain deeply divided over whether to engage in talks, as they have been for years, and that the remaining Qaeda presence in the region is proving more resilient than officials had anticipated.As a result, Afghan and American officials are girding for another year of bloody fighting with the insurgents. Senior Obama administration officials broadly concluded during meetings over the last week that many of the roughly 10,000 troops and thousands of civilian contractors in Afghanistan would be needed well into 2016, officials said.A change in the administration's plans would be further evidence of the continuing demands of America's longest war, which has raged on even after President Obama declared an end to America's ""combat role"" in Afghanistan. It would also reflect the impact of events in Iraq last year, where Iraqi military units collapsed in the face of an offensive by the Islamic State and the administration was compelled to send troops back to the country.At the same time, the change would expose Mr. Obama to criticism from members of his own party who have pressed him to end America's military role in Afghanistan. Some of the American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified deliberations over troop strength, said there might not be a public announcement on troop numbers to avoid potential criticism that Mr. Obama is backing away from his pledge to end the war in Afghanistan before he leaves office.The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said on Thursday that Mr. Obama had yet to make a final decision about altering the plans to pull out troops, most of whom are there to train and advise Afghan forces, not to fight. But Mr. Earnest added that the president has always said that the military strategy would ""constantly be checked against the security situation inside Afghanistan.""Another senior administration official said that Afghanistan's new president, Ashraf Ghani, had requested flexibility on the pace of the drawdown, and that ""we are actively considering that request.""Other officials said that the decision was all but made and that only the details had to be worked out. ""President Obama has to decide the slope, the pace, of the withdrawal, but all indications are that he'll delay,"" said one of the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal policy deliberations.The intensity of the fighting in Afghanistan usually ebbs and flows with changing seasons, and the Taliban usually hunker down during the colder months when the high mountain passes connecting them to sanctuaries in Pakistan are blocked by snow. But snow and cold have brought little relief this year, with American military officials saying that the fighting this winter has been among the most intense since the war began.The approaching summer fighting season is expected to be even more intense, adding to the urgency of the situation. There are also concerns about the ability of Afghan forces, which have struggled to hold off Taliban offensives since taking the lead in security over the past two years.Exactly how many American troops would remain in Afghanistan, and how far into 2016 they would stay, is still to be decided, the officials said. They also insisted that the administration was, for now, committed to withdrawing all but a small force to protect the embassy in Kabul by the end of 2016.Mr. Obama is expected to discuss the shifting plans for 2016 when he meets with Mr. Ghani during a scheduled visit to Washington next week. Mr. Ghani has pushed to keep as many international troops on hand as possible for as long as possible.American commanders have similarly called for a slower withdrawal. But Mr. Obama's wariness of his military's judgment on Afghanistan runs deep, and Mr. Ghani's willingness to work with the United States has been ""a big deal"" for Mr. Obama, a senior American official said.""There's a partner there now, and the thinking is that we should help,"" the official said.Since assuming office in September, Mr. Ghani has shown a far greater willingness to work with the United States than had his predecessor, Hamid Karzai. Mr. Ghani, for example, eased restrictions on nighttime raids and airstrikes by American-led forces put in place by Mr. Karzai.During a trip to Afghanistan last month, Ashton B. Carter, the new secretary of defense, said the administration was open to slowing the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, citing the improved relations under Mr. Ghani. And military leaders have openly said that Afghan forces still need American support.""We have to make sure that the Afghan security forces continue to improve,"" said Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, speaking to the benefits of a more prolonged drawdown during a House hearing on Tuesday.""We have to continue to help them as they continue to fight,"" he added. ""It's important we stay with them and that we have a conditions-based capability.""On the ground in Afghanistan, those conditions remain tenuous. In eastern and southern Afghanistan, where the Taliban have traditionally been strongest, only airstrikes and other help from the American-led military coalition kept the Taliban from seizing significant territory during last year's fighting season. The insurgents also pushed into parts of northern Afghanistan that were recently viewed as being firmly under government control.Keeping the number of troops closer to 10,000 would also allow the American-led coalition to maintain two large bases in Kandahar, the main city in southern Afghanistan, and in Jalalabad, the biggest city in the country's east. The base in Jalalabad is a hub for the collection of intelligence on Qaeda operations; it was, for instance, the base from which American forces launched the raid in 2011 that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan.Despite the formal end of the American-led combat mission in Afghanistan, coalition forces are still regularly launching airstrikes to support Afghan soldiers and police, and American Special Operations troops are still raiding remote villages and mountainside redoubts that shelter both Taliban fighters and operatives from Al Qaeda and other foreign extremist groups.In Washington, officials have sought to draw a sharp line between the two groups, saying counterterrorism forces -- which number about 2,000 -- are in Afghanistan to target only those who pose a direct threat to the United States. The Taliban, whose main focus is toppling Afghanistan's government, is a problem for Afghan forces.But distinctions on the ground are more blurred. Foreign fighters often work alongside Taliban insurgents, providing expertise.To help Afghan forces, American commanders have also interpreted their mandate to target any insurgent, Taliban or otherwise, who intends to attack coalition or Afghan forces, allowing them to go after Taliban commanders and other insurgents.",1.0
Somali Militant Is Killed in Strike:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon said Wednesday that airstrikes last week against the Shabab extremist group were successful, and that Adan Garar, a senior member of the group, had been killed in a drone strike on his vehicle.The strike, carried out last Thursday as Mr. Garar traveled near Diinsoor, Somalia, ""dealt another significant blow"" to the Shabab group and killed Mr. Garar, who is believed to have planned the 2013 attack on the Westgate mall in Kenya, the Defense Department said.For nearly a decade the United States has been trying to fight the Shabab through economic sanctions, missile strikes and commando raids. Last year, the Obama administration stepped up its efforts, and in September an American drone strike killed the leader the group, Ahmed Abdi Godane, one of the most wanted men in Africa.At the time President Obama drew a direct link between the killing of Mr. Godane, who turned an obscure local militant group into one of the most fearsome franchises of Al Qaeda in the world, and American plans to go after the leaders of the Islamic State in Iraq. The Pentagon press secretary at the time, Rear Adm. John Kirby, called the death of Mr. Godane ""a major symbolic and operational loss"" to the Shabab.",1.0
"Piles of Rocks, Thrown Across America's Bow:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BEIJING -- Much more is at stake in the American decision to challenge China by sending a destroyer near islands it built in the South China Sea than a handful of rocks, even if they sit on major shipping lines and deposits of natural resources.China, analysts say, is seeking to establish a sphere of influence in these waters -- and edge out the United States.What that means -- whether it represents a crisis, or a natural and inevitable shift given China's economic strength -- depends on whom you ask. But there is little doubt that China is thinking big about how these islands could limit America's military options, about how control over these waters could give it leverage over key trade routes and about how making the United States look hapless could strengthen its diplomatic clout in the region.""They have a game plan; it is very clear what it is,"" said Christopher K. Johnson, senior adviser on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington at a recent seminar. ""Sometimes, I think it is easy to get lost in the weeds on what has been built on which island.""On late Monday, the United States sent a guided missile destroyer into waters near one of the artificial islands, Subi Reef, that China considers its territory. China promptly called the naval patrol a ""deliberate provocation.""The construction of the islands, which has also involved building military installations and runways, shows how China is determined to push back the United States' post-World War II alliance system, some experts say.The United States sent ships and planes to the Taiwan Strait with impunity during a crisis 20 years ago in what was considered a strategic backyard for American forces. It would be much more difficult today for the United States to act in the same manner, Mr. Johnson said.To achieve its goals, China is spending heavily on its navy, including on nuclear-powered submarines. The construction of a second aircraft carrier is underway to supplement the first carrier, launched in 2012. Its Coast Guard is growing rapidly and now has the world's largest cutter, a 10,000-metric-ton vessel built at the Jiangnan Shipyard, where its builders nicknamed it the ""monster.""Shipbuilding for China's Coast Guard is so robust that the fleet now has more than three times as many ships than had been planned just a few years ago, said Ryan D. Martinson, research administrator at the China Maritime Studies Institute at the United States Naval War College in Newport, R.I.The buildup of maritime power means China, traditionally a continental power, is transforming its capabilities in an effort to secure its interests along the vital sea lanes that pass from the South China Sea through the Strait of Malacca and across the Indian Ocean to Africa and the Middle East into Europe. Much of China's commercial trade and energy supplies travel that route.How the South China Sea would operate with a dominant China is a matter of debate.Does China want to threaten foreign powers with force if they intervene, a model fashioned after the Monroe Doctrine, asked M. Taylor Fravel, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. If the goal was to try to exclude the United States, then China's actions so far have been counterproductive, he said.Mr. Fravel suggested that the free flow of shipping through the South China Sea was not incompatible with greater Chinese influence in the region.""If the attraction of China's economy and of Chinese investment is one source of political influence, China has few incentives to interfere with the international waterways in the South China Sea,"" he said. ""In fact, such interference would likely weaken China's influence and not enhance it. If China aspires to greater influence in the region, its ability to achieve and maintain that influence requires ensuring an open, dynamic trading system that links Asia with other regions.""Others are less sanguine. Creating a sphere of influence in the South China Sea would not necessarily mean China would abide by the rules, Kurt M. Campbell, former assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said at the recent Center for Strategic and International Studies seminar.The United States is trying to persuade China to sustain the post-World War II operating system in Asia -- freedom of navigation, peaceful settlement of disputes and fidelity of contracts -- that has given Asia perhaps its best four or five decades in 1,000 years, Mr. Campbell said. But now the Chinese are saying the status quo no longer holds in the South China Sea. It is natural, but worrying, that as a rising power challenging the existing order, China wants to put its ""own stamp on things,"" he said.""If you listen very carefully to Chinese friends, they are saying this is no longer an international waterway,"" Mr. Campbell said. ""That we will provide safety for the ships transmitting this water. My own personal view is that this is antithetical to our strategic interests and in fact antithetical to Chinese strategic interests.""Despite concerns in the United States, it is not in China's interests to use force to get its way in the South China Sea, said Wu Xinbo, director of the center of American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. ""It would be foolish for China to use force on other claimants in the South China Sea. The political and strategic cost is too high.""China's objectives are not necessarily sinister and from its point of view represent a ""sensible"" strategic approach, said former Rear Adm. Michael McDevitt, now a senior fellow at CNA, a nonprofit research organization in Arlington, Va.""Since the South China Sea was the traditional route the West used on the way to invading, China wants to make sure that eventually they can establish sea control in the South China Sea in times of conflict,"" Mr. McDevitt said, referring to Britain and other European powers. ""It is our job to make sure that they cannot keep us at bay should there be a conflict.""Hugh White, a critic of the United States' response to China's growing power whose message is unpopular in Washington but well received among Chinese analysts, said China's short-term goal in the South China Sea was to throw its weight around and to show America's allies that Washington was unable to respond effectively.The Obama administration had tried with its freedom-of-navigation maneuver near the artificial island, Subi Reef, to show that it was doing something to counter Chinese ambitions, said Mr. White, a professor of strategic studies at Australian National University.But the action was too timid, he said. The destroyer traveled within 12 nautical miles of the new island, and then left quietly and quickly, and American officials were barred from describing it in any detail. It left the opposite impression of being strong in the face of a determined power and allowed the Chinese to move ahead undeterred, he said.""It showed just how reluctant Washington is to stand up to China for fear of provoking a crisis,"" Mr. White said.",1.0
Turkey Says It Hit Kurdish Militias in Cross-Border Raids:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Turkey has confirmed that it struck positions in Syria held by Kurdish militias that over the last year have become the most important allies within Syria of the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State.The confirmation of the strikes, which the Kurds said took place over the weekend, adds a new level of complexity to the United States' struggle to put together a coherent strategy to fight the Islamic State in Syria. It also increases tensions between the United States and Turkey, which are nominally allies in the battle against the militant group, but whose interests diverge substantially.In an interview on a Turkish news channel Monday night, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey did not specify when the strikes had taken place, but he said they came after Turkey's government in Ankara warned Kurdish fighters not to move west of the Euphrates River.""We struck them twice,"" Mr. Davutoglu said.The Turkish strikes were in Tal Abyad, a largely Arab border town that the Kurds captured from the Islamic State over the summer. The strikes appear to have been limited -- they were said to involve machine-gun fire from across the border and did not seem to cause much damage -- but they could suggest a new determination by Turkey to expand military operations against the American-allied group.Turkey has long considered the Syrian Kurdish group known as the Democratic Union Party, or P.Y.D., as an enemy because it is the Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has long fought an insurgency against the Turkish state.The armed wing of the P.Y.D., the People's Protection Units, said in a statement that Turkey struck its positions in Tal Abyad on Saturday and Sunday and that a separate Turkish attack, on Sunday in the village of Buban, wounded two civilians.The group has accused Turkey of targeting it on several occasions, but Mr. Davutoglu's comments on Monday were the first time Turkey acknowledged doing so.The limited Turkish strikes came after the P.Y.D. declared last week that Tal Abyad was part of an autonomous region in northern Syria that the Kurds call Rojava. Turkey views the development as a national security threat because it could inflame separatist sentiments among its own Kurds.The government had already renewed fighting in July with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K., both in Turkey and in Iraq, where the group has camps in the mountains of the north. But Turkey had, for a time, seemed to turn a blind eye to Syria's Kurds because of their growing relationship with the United States, which had argued that the P.Y.D. should be regarded as separate from the P.K.K., even though the groups have close ties and a shared socialist ideology.Turkey now seems intent on viewing the two groups as one and the same. In recent weeks, it has sharply criticized United States support for the Syrian Kurds, which began last year during the battle for Kobani.The situation grew more complicated recently when Russia began military operations in Syria, largely in support of the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, which Turkey has sought to oust through its support of rebel groups.Russia's ties to the P.K.K. and the P.Y.D. date to the days of the Soviet Union, and it is believed to be offering support to Syrian Kurds.To register its displeasure, Turkey recently summoned the ambassadors of Russia and the United States to raise concerns over support to the Syrian Kurds.This coincided with a move that alarmed Turkey, an American airdrop of 50 tons of ammunition in northern Syria to a coalition of Arab and Kurdish fighters who were preparing to battle the Islamic State near its Syrian stronghold of Raqqa.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"Saudi Coalition Destroys a Hospital in Yemen, Aid Group Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- A hospital in northern Yemen run by Doctors Without Borders was destroyed by warplanes belonging to a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia, even though the coalition had been given the coordinates of the hospital, the relief organization said Tuesday.The airstrikes, about 10:30 p.m. Monday, forced the evacuation of staff and patients from the site and raised new questions about what precautions Saudi Arabia and its military partners were taking to avoid civilians.The coalition, of 10 Arab states, receives military and intelligence support from the United States and has been battling Yemen's Houthi rebels since March. Bombings by the coalition have killed more than 1,100 people -- the majority of civilian casualties during the war, according to human rights advocates. The airstrikes have also hit nonmilitary targets, including markets, houses and wedding parties.""With the hospital destroyed, at least 200,000 people now have no access to lifesaving medical care,"" Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. Hassan Boucenine, the group's head of mission in Yemen, said in the statement that the attack was ""another illustration of a complete disregard for civilians in Yemen, where bombings have become a daily routine.""A spokesman for the coalition did not return phone calls seeking comment.Mr. Boucenine said in an interview that the hospital was hit by several airstrikes while roughly a dozen patients and staff members were inside. The operating theater and maternity ward were struck. The staff evacuated the hospital between strikes, and one staff member was slightly injured in the escape.The airstrikes then continued for at least two hours, leaving most of the facility in rubble, the group said.Doctors Without Borders had supplied the hospital's coordinates to the coalition about six months ago and reconfirmed them every month, Mr. Boucenine said. The group's logo was on the roof.The small hospital, in the Haydan district along the border with Saudi Arabia, was one of the few still operating in the northern province of Saada. The province has been heavily bombed by the coalition for months.Doctors Without Borders said about 3,400 patients had been treated since the group began supporting the hospital in May.""The bombing of civilians and hospitals is a violation of international humanitarian law and M.S.F. is demanding that coalition forces explain the circumstances around the attack,"" the statement said, using the abbreviation for the group's French name, Médecins Sans Frontières.American officials said little Tuesday about the hospital airstrikes.""Senior U.S. officials remain in close and regular contact with the Saudi government on a wide range of issues related to Yemen,"" said Col. Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for the United States Central Command. ""We have asked the Saudi government to investigate all credible reports of civilian casualties resulting from coalition-led airstrikes and, if confirmed, to address the factors that led to them.""Spokesmen for the White House and the C.I.A. declined to comment.",1.0
"Challenging Chinese Claims, U.S. Sends Warship to Artificial Island Chain:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"WASHINGTON -- A United States Navy destroyer entered waters near the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea late Monday, Defense Department officials said, directly challenging China's claims that the artificial island chain is within its territorial borders.The Lassen, a guided missile destroyer, sailed within 12 nautical miles of the islands, making a long-anticipated entry into the disputed waters, an American military official said. American officials did not inform their Chinese counterparts as they planned the provocative maneuver, saying that to do so would have undercut their message.""You don't need to consult with any nation when you are exercising the right of freedom of navigation in international waters,"" John Kirby, the State Department spokesman, said at a news conference.Mr. Kirby said that such a challenge to what he called a questionable sovereignty claim was ""one of the reasons you have a navy -- to be able to exert influence and defend freedom of navigation on international waters.""China has been reclaiming land in the South China and East China Seas for several years, and the projects in the vicinity of the Spratlys have come under increasing criticism from the United States and its regional allies, including the Philippines. The United States and several Asian nations dispute the legitimacy of the islands built by China.As news of the American maneuver circulated in Beijing, China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, urged the United States to ""think twice before taking any reckless action,"" China's national broadcaster, CCTV, reported.The Obama administration did not make an immediate announcement of the maneuver, and Pentagon officials would only confirm that it had occurred, as they forecast weeks ago.The White House declined to share any details about the operation, referring questions to the Defense Department. But Josh Earnest, the press secretary, noted that President Obama stood next to President Xi Jinping of China at a Rose Garden news conference last month and said that the United States would operate, fly or sail anywhere that international law allowed.""That certainly includes the ability of our Navy to operate in international waters,"" Mr. Earnest said. ""This is a critically important principle, particularly in the South China Sea, because there are billions of dollars of commerce that flow through that region of the world every year -- maybe even more than that -- and ensuring the free flow of this commerce, and that freedom of navigation of those vessels is protected, is critically important to the global economy.""American officials had said for the last month that the Navy would send a surface ship into the waters claimed by China, a vow widely viewed as a signal to the Chinese that most of the rest of the world does not recognize its claim on the island chain. Mr. Obama approved the move this month, administration officials said.The president signaled the Navy maneuver last month at the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, when he said that the United States had an ""interest in upholding the basic principles of freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce and in resolving disputes through international law, not the law of force.""China, in what some Asia analysts interpreted as a gesture to pre-empt the American naval maneuver, sent warships into United States territorial waters in August. Five Chinese ships came within 12 miles of the coast of Alaska while Mr. Obama was visiting the state.But American military officials said that the two maneuvers were not comparable, citing international maritime laws that allow passage such as the Chinese transit near Alaska if there is no other passageway for a ship to reach its destination.In the case of the Spratly Islands, one American military official said, there were several other routes that the United States destroyer could have used, but the military deliberately chose to enter the waters that China claims as its territory.In recent years, China has been claiming large parts of the strategic waterway by enlarging rocks and submerged reefs into islands big enough for military airstrips, radar equipment and lodging for soldiers, American officials said.Although China claims much of the South China Sea as sovereign territory, the 12-mile zone around the new islands is particularly delicate because international law says that artificial islands do not have sovereign rights up to the 12-mile limit.The United States had not traveled close to the Chinese-occupied islands in the South China Sea since at least 2012. In May, a United States Navy surveillance plane flew near three of China's five artificial islands but did not go within the 12-mile zones. Chinese Navy radio operators warned the Americans to leave the area.Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.",1.0
"U.S. Airstrike Killed Iraqis by Accident, Officials Say:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"ABOARD THE U.S.S. KEARSARGE -- An airstrike that mistakenly killed Iraqi troops on Friday was carried out by an American plane, United States officials said on Saturday.The episode poses a fresh challenge to the Obama administration's efforts to expand cooperation with the Iraqis in fighting the Islamic State, and Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter was quick to call the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, to express his condolences and invite Iraq to participate in an investigation.Mr. Carter did not offer a detailed explanation for the errant airstrike, which killed nine Iraqi soldiers and one officer, according to Iraq's defense minister. But Mr. Carter said, ""It seemed to be a mistake that involved both sides.""""These kind of things can happen when you are fighting side by side as we are, on a dynamic battlefield,"" Mr. Carter told reporters aboard the Kearsarge, an assault ship deployed in the Persian Gulf.Another American official, who asked for anonymity to discuss an episode under investigation, said the plane that carried out the attack was a B-1B bomber, which dropped several bombs as it was supporting Iraqi forces battling Islamic State fighters near Falluja. At least one of those bombs, it appears, struck the Iraqi troops.Bad weather may have been a contributing factor, American and Iraqi officials say. With fog in the area, it may have been difficult for reconnaissance drones or aircraft to keep track of the shifting Iraqi positions. A third American official said the Iraqi troops appeared to have been closer to the target area than the Americans had realized.There have been few instances of ""friendly fire"" in Iraq since the American-led campaign against the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, began last year. One important military question raised by the attack is whether the risk of such episodes might be reduced by deploying teams of air controllers with the Iraqi forces, particularly when Iraqi troops are fighting with the Islamic State in urban areas or at close quarters.Seeking to minimize the risk of American casualties, the Obama administration decided early in the campaign that the American advisers and trainers who are assisting Iraqi troops would work inside the confines of several large bases in Iraq. But that has meant that American commanders have had to rely on aircraft to confirm the targeting information provided by Iraqi troops instead of on American air controllers on the battlefield.A broader political question is whether the episode will make it harder for Mr. Abadi to accept an expanded role for the United States, which is seeking to speed up the campaign against the Islamic State. Mr. Carter told Congress this month that the Obama administration was prepared to support the Iraqi military with Apache attack helicopters in its fight to reclaim Ramadi. He also said the administration was ready to deploy advisers with select Iraqi brigades.""The United States is prepared to assist the Iraqi Army with additional unique capabilities to help them finish the job, including attack helicopters and accompanying advisers, if circumstances dictate and if requested by Prime Minister Abadi,"" Mr. Carter told the Senate Armed Services Committee.Mr. Abadi, however, has been weakened by a series of political struggles with his rivals, and has come under pressure from Shiite politicians who are close to Iran to reject a greater United States military role in Iraq. He did not take up the Pentagon on its offer when he met with Mr. Carter on Wednesday.But American officials hope that Mr. Abadi will agree to the use of Apache helicopters and advisers for future operations, which are expected to be more challenging as Iraqi forces look toward the battle for Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city.The political dynamics in Iraq were clear with the divergent response to the airstrike. Hakim al-Zamili, the chairman of the Iraqi Parliament's defense and security committee and a political supporter of the anti-United States Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, provided a far higher toll than the Defense Ministry's and demanded an investigation.Mr. Abadi, however, accepted Mr. Carter's explanation that the episode was a genuine mistake, and expressed hope that politicians in Iraq and elsewhere would not try to exploit the airstrike for their own purposes, according to the Americans' account of the phone call from Mr. Carter to Mr. Abadi.""He and I both expressed regret over the incident and also determination to continue the campaign to expel ISIL from Iraqi territory,"" Mr. Carter said.There are signs, however, that the political debate over the incident might linger, as even Iraqi officials who work closely with the Americans say there must strict accountability.According to the Iraqi military, the Iraqis turned to the American-led coalition for air support during the fight because bad weather precluded the use of Iraqi airpower. The American plane carried out two strikes, which resulted in a significant number of Islamic State casualties and enabled the Iraqi force to quickly advance. But the coalition that did not realize that the Iraqi troops had moved forward when a third strike occurred.Khaled al-Obeidi, Iraq's defense minister issued a statement on Saturday saying that Iraqis would carry out their own inquiry to determine whether Iraqi forces or the coalition was at fault for failing to update the information on the position of the Iraqi troops. The Iraqi government, he said, will not tolerate the loss of ""Iraqi blood.""Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.",1.0
"Bomber Was Near a Disputed Island in Error, U.S. Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"WASHINGTON -- A United States B-52 bomber last week mistakenly flew within two nautical miles of a disputed artificial island built by China in the South China Sea, Pentagon officials said Friday.The incident, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, drew the ire of the Chinese, who claim that the chain, called the Spratly Islands, is within China's territorial borders. That claim is disputed by China's neighbors and by the United States.""The Chinese have raised concerns with us about the flight path of a recent B-52 training mission,"" Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said Friday. ""We are looking into the incident.""On Saturday, China's Defense Ministry issued an angry response to the flight, which it said occurred on Dec. 10 and involved two bombers.""What the United States did was a serious military provocation, complicating the situation in the South China Sea, to the extent of militarizing it,"" the ministry said in a statement posted on its website. ""We demand that the United States immediately take action to prevent such dangerous actions from taking place, and not damage bilateral military relations.""But the Chinese gave no indication that they would take any specific actions in response, stating only that ""China's military will take all necessary means and measures to safeguard the country's sovereignty and security.""Captain Davis said that ""for this mission there was no intention of flying within 12 nautical miles"" of the island, using a phrase that seemed intended to show that it was only for this particular mission that the United States did not mean to fly close to the islands.In October, a United States Navy destroyer made a point of entering waters near the Spratly Islands in a challenge to China's claim that the chain is within its territorial borders. The ship, the Lassen, a guided-missile destroyer, sailed within 12 nautical miles of the islands, and American officials did not inform their Chinese counterparts as they planned the maneuver, saying that to do so would have undercut their message.News of the B-52 flight, and the Chinese response, came days after the United States announced a planned $1.83 billion arms sale to Taiwan, angering China, which said it would sanction American companies that made the armaments. China considers Taiwan, which has been governed separately since 1949, to be a breakaway province.Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: Asian Morning newsletter.

Airstrikes Take Toll on Civilians in Yemen War:   [Foreign Desk ],,"HAJJA, Yemen -- The airstrike slammed into Al-Sham water-bottling plant at the end of the night shift, killing 13 workers who were minutes away from heading home.Standing among the strewn bottles, smoldering boxes and pulverized machines a few days after the airstrike here, the owner, Ibrahim al-Razoom, searched in vain for any possible reason that warplanes from a Saudi-led military coalition would have attacked the place.Nothing in the ruins suggested the factory was used for making bombs, as a coalition spokesman had claimed. And it was far from any military facility that would explain the strike as a tragic mistake: For miles around, there was nothing but desert scrub.""It never occurred to me that this would be hit,"" Mr. Razoom said.Of the many perils Yemen's civilians have faced during the last six months of war, with starvation looming and their cities crumbling under heavy weapons, none have been as deadly as the coalition airstrikes. What began as a Saudi-led aerial campaign against the Houthis, the rebel militia movement that forced Yemen's government from power, has become so broad and vicious that critics accuse the coalition of collectively punishing people living in areas under Houthi control.Errant coalition strikes have ripped through markets, apartment buildings and refugee camps. Other bombs have fallen so far from any military target -- like the one that destroyed Mr. Razoom's factory -- that human rights groups say such airstrikes amount to war crimes. More than a thousand civilians are believed to have died in the strikes, the toll rising steadily with little international notice or outrage.Rather than turning more Yemenis against the Houthis, though, the strikes are crystallizing anger in parts of the country against Saudi Arabia and its partners, including the United States. The Obama administration has provided military intelligence and logistical assistance to the coalition, and American weapons have been widely used in the air campaign. Human Rights Watch has found American-manufactured cluster munitions in the fields of Yemeni farmers. Near the site of airstrikes that killed 11 people in a mosque, researchers with Amnesty International saw an unexploded, 1,000-pound American bomb. The United States is finalizing a deal to provide more weapons to Saudi Arabia, including missiles for its F-15 fighter jets.In parts of northern Yemen, which is populated largely by Shiite Muslims, residents told reporters making a rare visit to the area that the bombing campaign by the Sunni coalition often feels like a sectarian purge. Airstrikes nearest the border with Saudi Arabia have been so intense that people have taken shelter in mountain caves or been forced farther south, often on foot, where they set up flimsy camps on the side of the road.Neighborhoods in the northern city of Saada have been so heavily bombed that locals joke grimly that the coalition has run out of buildings to hit. The shrinking pool of targets has not stopped the planes that circle daily over Sana, the capital, from bombing the same security buildings over and over again, with a bewildering and terrible frequency.The Saudi-led coalition has rarely if ever acknowledged killing civilians by mistake, even after the deadliest strikes, like the bombing of a residential compound for workers in Mokha in July that killed at least 63 people. Instead, the coalition blames the Houthis, accusing them of fighting from populated areas.""Why would we acknowledge something that doesn't exist?"" said Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, the coalition's spokesman, when asked whether the airstrikes had killed noncombatants. He said it should fall to Yemen's exiled government or the United Nations to investigate such deaths.Col. Patrick S. Ryder, a spokesman for United States Central Command, said American officials had asked ""the Saudi government to investigate all credible reports of civilian casualties resulting from coalition-led airstrikes, and if confirmed, to address the factors that led to them.""A tense political standoff erupted into war in March, after the Houthi militias ousted the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who fled abroad. Saudi Arabia launched its offensive with the stated goal of returning Mr. Hadi to power, but was motivated by far deeper anxieties, analysts said.The Saudis, already shaken by the Obama administration's nuclear deal with their regional rival, Iran, viewed the Shiite-led Houthis as an Iranian proxy gaining strength just over its border. The Houthis have denied acting on Iran's orders; Saudi allies, including the United States, said the fears were exaggerated.More than 4,500 people have been killed in the war. Hundreds have died in street battles between the Houthis and their rivals for control of Yemen's most important cities, like Taiz and Aden, where residents have accused the Houthis in particular of resorting to brutal force. The ground war and harsh Saudi restrictions on imports have deepened humanitarian suffering in Yemen, causing shortages of fuel, water and medical supplies while inflating prices of food and other goods.The majority of civilians have been killed by coalition warplanes, often dropping American munitions ranging from 250 to 2,000 pounds. There are no comprehensive tallies of the deaths. But the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner said on Friday that of 1,527 civilians who died between the start of the Saudi offensive and June 30, at least 941 people were killed by airstrikes.The airstrikes have helped the coalition advance in southern Yemen, where anti-Houthi sentiment is strong. But the mounting civilian toll has raised concerns about the tactics of the coalition of Arab armies fighting alongside the Saudis, and seeking to prove its mettle as a regional counterweight to Iran's influence. As the coalition has amassed troops and weapons in central Yemen in preparation for a possible ground invasion of Sana, fears have grown that the capital, with its meticulously preserved Old City, will suffer the same fate as other Yemeni treasures destroyed during the conflict.The United Arab Emirates said its pilots have played a central role in a recent flurry of airstrikes, in apparent retaliation for a Houthi attack Aug. 4 that killed at least 45 Emirati soldiers fighting in Yemen. Since then, Sana has come under its heaviest bombardment of the war. The day after the Emirati soldiers were killed, at least 21 civilians died in airstrikes across the capital, according to relatives of the victims. Bombings in one district killed nine people, in a pattern that characterized many of the attacks.The coalition jets focused on a university that the Houthis had used as a base, plowing craters in the dirt and bombing a warehouse on the campus that appeared to be full of office furniture. But they also struck a residential area overlooking the university, with at least three separate airstrikes, partially damaging or demolishing six houses.""They kill innocents and claim to be killing Houthis. They are targeting the whole population,"" said Adam Mujahid Abdulla, a 20-year-old survivor of the strikes, who was recovering in a hospital last week, bandages covering burns over 65 percent of his body.The bomb that struck his house killed seven members of his family. But his friends, visiting in the hospital, were too worried about his condition to tell him that his relatives, including his mother and four siblings, had died.Across town, another airstrike sliced through a building of shops and apartments, killing seven people. In the rubble, people dug out the remains of Mohib Mohammed, 26, the local barber. ""They only found his legs,"" said Ayman Mahmoud, who arrived at the neighborhood soon after the airstrike.The strike's victims included Tayseer Okba, a 12-year-old girl who that morning had been visiting her 65-year-old grandmother, Amana al-Khowlani.There is little mystery about the repeated attacks on the northern Saada Province, the birthplace of the Houthi movement. Months ago, the Saudi coalition declared that the entire province was a military zone, drawing an outcry from human rights groups that did little to deter the warplanes.In border areas that the Houthis have used for attacks into Saudi Arabia, the coalition forces have struck deep into Yemeni territory, bombing hospitals, roads and towns even when no Houthi fighters are present, said Dr. Natalie Roberts, who worked with Doctors Without Borders in one of the few clinics in the province.Mothers delivered babies in caves where they found shelter. People who were ill waited weeks before traveling to hospitals. ""It's no kind of life,"" Dr. Roberts said. ""Waiting in a cave to see if you're going to get bombed.""A road leading into Saada has been cratered by airstrikes that destroyed at least four bridges and obliterated trucks carrying fuel or livestock. In Saada City, so many houses were bombed in one neighborhood that all the residents simply fled.Omar Mohammed al-Ghaily, 28, sat in the center of town, near the ruins of his clothing store, destroyed in airstrikes that razed a stretch of government buildings. The strikes killed Seif Ahmed Seif, who owned an umbrella store. Mr. Ghaily kept Mr. Seif's identity card, maybe to return it one day to his daughter, who lives far away in Taiz. He kept coming to the rubble, he said, because he had ""no place to go.""Saada had suffered mightily over the last decade, when the Houthis fought six wars against Yemen's central government. But those conflicts paled in comparison to the damage being inflicted by the coalition, Mr. Ghaily said: ""this war from the sky.""",1.0
Sea Dispute Causes a Rift as Officials Meet in Asia:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIJING -- Differences over the South China Sea forced countries from Southeast Asia, along with China and the United States, to cancel a joint statement at a meeting of defense ministers in Malaysia on Wednesday.The Chinese Ministry of Defense confirmed that the meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, had failed to conclude a joint declaration, and it blamed ""the individual country (countries) out of the region."" In a statement on its website, the ministry implied, but did not name, the United States as the main reason for the breakdown in the discussions.The ministry did not mention the South China Sea or China's insistence that the statement not include any mention of the strategic waterway.Diplomats from countries in the region said that China had pushed for even a factual statement of the South China Sea to be absent from the joint declaration scheduled for the end of the gathering Wednesday afternoon.The meeting was split between countries that agreed with China and those that strongly disagreed, including Australia, Japan and the United States, two senior diplomats involved in the talks said.China maintains that its territorial claims in the South China Sea must be discussed with individual countries that also have claims. It has consistently opposed efforts to have conflicting claims discussed in a regional setting like Asean, whose defense ministers are meeting in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, with their counterparts from Australia, India, Japan and the United States.""The responsibility fully rests on the individual country (countries) out of the region as the meeting failed to issue the joint statement as scheduled,"" the Chinese Defense Ministry said on its website.The American defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, was attending the meeting, and the United States led the effort to have the sea accorded a place in the communiqué, the diplomats said. Mr. Carter met with China's minister of defense, Chang Wanquan, on Tuesday in Malaysia, where the South China Sea was high on the agenda.The gathering in Malaysia comes a week after the United States carried out a freedom of navigation operation inside the 12-nautical-mile radius of Subi Reef, in the Spratly archipelago not far from the Philippines. The operation was devised by the Pentagon to show that the reef, which China has built into an artificial island with an airfield, was in international waters and was not entitled to a 12-mile territorial claim. China has built seven artificial islands in the South China Sea in the last several years.China's extensive island construction could bolster it militarily in the strategic waterway, something that has unnerved countries in the region. Some nations, like the Philippines, an American ally, and Vietnam, a former enemy, have asked the United States for more military assistance since China's policy on the South China Sea has hardened.""The countries of Southeast Asia are going to have to decide to push back against China, or see the South China Sea turn into a Chinese lake,"" one of the diplomats involved in the defense ministers gathering said.The sea was the most contentious issue among the Asean defense ministers in Malaysia. Both the Philippines and Vietnam were among the Asian countries unwilling to sign the declaration if it had no mention of the South China Sea, the diplomats said.",1.0
"Rebels Advance in Yemen, Despite Saudi Airstrikes:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"AL MUKALLA, Yemen -- Forces aligned with the Iranian-backed Houthi movement continued their advance into areas of southern Yemen on Friday as Saudi Arabia conducted a second day of airstrikes intended to stop them.The Houthis' advance in the face of airstrikes is focusing attention on the possibility of the Saudi-led coalition's deploying ground troops, a move that would further escalate Yemeni civil war toward a regional battle.The Saudi government has said it has no plans to send troops, but declined to rule out the possibility. On Thursday, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, a close ally of the Saudis, said Cairo was prepared to send troops ""if necessary.""President Obama, in a call Friday to King Salman of Saudi Arabia, emphasized the United States' support for the Saudi-led operation, according to a National Security Council statement, but both leaders said they sought a ""negotiated political solution.""Residents and local news reports said Friday that the Houthi-aligned forces were fighting in the streets of Aden, the southern town where the Saudi-backed president of Yemen, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, had until recently prepared to make his last stand.Clashes between the Houthi forces and fighters loyal to Mr. Hadi had plunged the city into chaos, residents said Friday. Soldiers had deserted army bases near the city, and opportunists had swooped in to plunder them.""They looted all military bases in the city,"" said one resident, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. ""Tanks were taken to pieces in one of the bases.""With Mr. Hadi's forces in disarray, civilians were arming themselves to oppose the incoming Houthi forces, and there was sporadic fighting in neighborhoods around the city. ""No one is leading the battles against the Houthis in Aden,"" the same resident said. ""People regrouped in the city's districts and formed their own militias to fight the Houthis.""Mr. Hadi lost control of the capital, Sana, to the Houthi forces months ago, and he finally escaped last month to take refuge among supporters in Aden. Then on Wednesday he disappeared again as the Houthi forces closed in, surfacing Thursday night in Saudi Arabia. On Friday, he landed in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, to represent Yemen at an Arab League meeting, but it was unclear whether he would return to Yemen anytime soon.The Houthis were also reported to be making gains in the restive southern provinces of Abyan and Shabwa, which had been expected to pose fierce resistance. Both provinces are home to pockets of Sunni Muslim extremists, including Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch, and the extremists loath the Houthis as heretics for following a variant of Shiite Islam.The Houthis represent a minority among Yemen's mostly Sunni Muslims, but the group has gained momentum by forming an alliance with Yemen's former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. He has helped enlist important parts of the military and security services still loyal to him to fight alongside the Houthis against Mr. Hadi's forces.On Thursday, the Houthi leaders sought to showcase their public support in the capital by holding a rally to condemn the Saudi Arabian air campaign. Thousands attended, suggesting that the movement may not be easy to crush through airstrikes alone.The Saudi-led coalition on Friday extended its airstrikes to three military bases controlled by forces loyal to Mr. Saleh and the Houthis in the central province of Marib, according to news reports and local tribal leaders. There were reports of strikes against the Houthi's home base in the north as well.Pentagon officials said late Friday that two Saudi airmen were rescued by the American military after they ejected from their plane over the Gulf of Aden.Philip Hammond, the British foreign secretary, said Friday that Britain, like the United States, was providing logistical and technical support to the Saudi-led campaign. He noted that the intervention had been requested by Yemen's legitimate government, under Mr. Hadi. ""But we're clearly not going to get involved in military action ourselves,"" Mr. Hammond said.He also discounted Saudi efforts to portray the Houthis as an instrument of Iranian influence.""The Houthi are not Iranian proxies in the sense that Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy,"" he added. ""I suspect if you went to Tehran, you'd find a degree of frustration in Tehran that, for all the support they pile in, they can't actually control what the Houthis do.""Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, denounced the Saudi-led operation Friday, accusing the kingdom of unleashing Sunni extremists like Al Qaeda against Shiites elsewhere.Mr. Hadi's foreign minister, Riyadh Yassin, in an interview Friday with the BBC, said that he hoped the airstrikes would end ""as soon as possible,"" and that the Houthis would ""understand the meaning of these strikes"" and come to negotiations.As for a ground invasion, he said it depended on ""the evaluation of the experts and the military people.""",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; South Korea: Two Men Are Arrested in North Korea on Spying Charges:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said on Friday that it had arrested two South Korean men on espionage charges for collecting military and other secrets on the isolated country, including data regarding its top leadership, and infiltrating it with political propaganda and subversive religious materials.During a news conference in Pyongyang on Thursday, the two men identified themselves as Kim Guk-gi, 60, and Choe Chun-gil, 55, and apologized for committing ""anti-state"" crimes while spying on behalf of South Korea's National Intelligence Service, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said in a dispatch on Friday.Officials from the State Security Department, the North's secret police, told the news conference that Mr. Kim and Mr. Choe were ""heinous terrorists"" who tried to harm the North's top leadership with ""assassination"" plots, the news agency said.The South Korean government immediately dismissed the claims as groundless, but confirmed that the men were its citizens. Lim Byeong-cheol, spokesman for the South Korean Ministry of National Unification, issued a statement on Friday demanding their immediate release and urging the North to allow South Korean lawyers to visit them. . The South Korean spy agency had also previously dismissed similar cases of alleged spying as fabrications by the North.The cases of Mr. Kim and Mr. Choe came amid growing signs that the border between China and North Korea has become part of a murky struggle between the rival Koreas. In recent years, South Korea has arrested several people who it said were North Korean spies who crossed the China-North Korea border and arrived in the South disguised as refugees.At the same time, the North has been accused of kidnapping or arresting several South Koreans or Korean-Americans who operated near the border, or visited the impoverished country as humanitarian workers or missionaries. North Korea charged them with working as spies. Last year, it sentenced a South Korean Baptist missionary to hard labor for life on charges of spying for the South and setting up an underground church to undermine the North Korean government.On Friday, North Korea said that Mr. Choe, who had lived in Dandong, a Chinese city near the border with North Korea, was arrested in December while visiting the North to smuggle out jewelry. It was not clear how Mr. Kim, who told the news conference that he had also lived in Dandong since 2003, ended up in the North.During the news conference, Mr. Kim said he was running an underground Christian church in Dandong in 2005, proselytizing among ethnic Koreans in China and North Korean refugees, when he was recruited as a spy by a National Intelligence Service official, the news agency said. Mr. Kim said he had been paid tens of thousands of dollars and given encrypted cellphones to collect information on plans by Kim Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, to visit China. Mr. Choe said his spy master instructed him between 2012 and 2013 to collect soil samples from near Yongbyon, the North's main nuclear complex, north of the capital Pyongyang.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
"U.S. Airstrikes on Tikrit Prompt Boycott, and Threats, by Shiite Fighters:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"AL RASHID AIR BASE, Iraq -- By Day 2 of the American airstrike campaign against militants holed up in Tikrit, the mission appeared beleaguered on several fronts on Thursday: Thousands of Shiite militiamen boycotted the fight, others threatened to attack any Americans they found, and Iraqi officials said nine of their fighters had been accidentally killed in an airstrike.In Washington, American military leaders insisted that things were going according to plan. They said that they were stepping into the Tikrit fight only after the Iranian- and militia-led advance on the city had stalled after three weeks, and that they welcomed working solely with Iraqi government forces.Gen. Lloyd Austin, the head of the United States Central Command, told a Senate hearing on Thursday that no Shiite militias remained in Tikrit.While the withdrawal of Iranian-led Shiite militias was one of the preconditions for the Americans to join the fight against the Islamic State in Tikrit, the sudden departure of three of the major groups risked leaving the Iraqi ground forces short-handed, especially if other Shiite militiamen also abandoned the fight.The three militia groups, some of which had Iranian advisers with them until recently, pulled out of the Tikrit fight to protest the American airstrikes, which began late Wednesday night, insisting that the Americans were not needed to defeat the extremists in Tikrit.Too great or abrupt a withdrawal by militia forces, analysts said, could complicate the entire Iraqi counteroffensive. Even with the militias involved, officials said the current pro-government force would not be large enough to eventually help take Mosul back from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.Top officials at the Pentagon appeared to think that it would not be easy to retake even Tikrit without Iranian help. ""It's going to require the kind of hammer-and-anvil approach of ground forces forcing ISIL to respond in ways that they're targetable by air power,"" one Defense Department official said. ""But we're less than 24 hours into it.""Another official, asked if he was worried that the United States now owned the Tikrit operation, said, ""Yes. This was a calculated risk, but it's one that had to be taken."" Both officials spoke on grounds of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.Together, the four Shiite groups that objected to the American air role already represent more than a third of the 30,000 fighters on the government side in the offensive against the Islamic State, analysts said.""We don't trust the American-led coalition in combating ISIS,"" said Naeem al-Uboudi, the spokesman for Asaib Ahl al-Haq, one of the three groups which said it would withdraw from the front line around Tikrit. ""In the past, they have targeted our security forces and dropped aid to ISIS by mistake,"" he said.One of the leaders of the biggest militias in the fight, the Badr Organization, also criticized the American role and said his group, too, might pull out.""We don't need the American-led coalition to participate in Tikrit. Tikrit is an easy battle, we can win it ourselves,"" said Mueen al-Kadhumi, who is one of the Shiite militia group's top commanders.""We have not yet decided if we will pull out or not,"" he said. The Badr Organization's leader, Hadi al-Ameri, was shown on Iraqi television leading the ground fight in Tikrit on Thursday.The office of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced Thursday night that he went personally to Tikrit, presumably to persuade Mr. Ameri to keep his fighters in the field.The Badr Organization fields the largest cohesive ground force in the conflict, and its withdrawal from Tikrit would be potentially catastrophic, according to Wafiq al-Hashimi, the head of the Iraqi Group for Strategic Studies.""Dr. Abadi rushed into this decision to liberate Tikrit with the Americans without taking time to work out a compromise among all these groups and the Americans, most of whom have a lot of disputes with the Americans,"" Mr. Hashimi said.Another Iranian-aligned Shiite militia group reacted with defiance and threats against the Americans.""We are staying in Tikrit, we are not leaving and we are going to target the American-led coalition in Tikrit and their creation, ISIS,"" said Akram al-Kabi, the leader of the Nujabaa Brigade, a powerful militia that has previously sent fighters to Syria on behalf of the Bashir al-Assad government there.His remarks raised the possibility that the group would use antiaircraft fire against coalition warplanes, using Iraqi fighting positions.On Thursday night, an airstrike on the village of Alvu Ajeel, on the edge of Tikrit, killed six Shiite militiamen, as well as three federal policemen, one of them a colonel, according to a spokesman for the Iraqi military's Salahuddin Operations Command. The strike was thought to have been carried out by the United States.The spokesman, who would not give his name because of official policy, described it as a ""friendly fire"" episode.A Pentagon spokesman said he could not confirm the event. ""We review all allegations and investigate those found credible,"" said Col. Steve Warren, director of Defense Press Operations.It was not known if the militiamen who were killed in the friendly fire episode belonged to Al Nujabaa or another group.The American airstrikes in Tikrit began late on Wednesday night and continued for eight and a half hours, subsiding at dawn on Thursday, when Iraq's handful of Russian-made fighter jets took over from this base on the outskirts of Baghdad and further bombed Tikrit in a succession of daytime raids, Iraqi officials said.The other groups that announced they would boycott the Tikrit operation were Qatab Hizbullah, which like Asaib Ahl al-Haq is closely aligned and supported by Iran, and the Peace Brigade, the latest name for a militia made of up followers of the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, previously known as the Mahdi Army.Mr. Sadr, whose troops fought bitter battles against the Americans during much of the Iraq war, said his group was pulling out because, ""The participation of the so-called international alliance is to protect ISIS on the one hand, and to confiscate the achievements of the Iraqis on the other hand.""Since March 2, Islamic State forces in Tikrit have been under attack by the Iraqi militias, collectively known as the Popular Mobilization Committees, and regular Iraqi military forces, accompanied at times by Iranian military advisers.Still, a much smaller force of Islamic State fighters has been able to hold them off in a few areas of the city for almost four weeks.In recent days, despite the claims of self-sufficiency made by militia commanders, Iraqi military officials said American airstrikes were needed to break the deadlock.The militias who were withdrawing did not say they were quitting their positions in the Tikrit area altogether, or in adjoining areas of Salahuddin Province, just returning to their nearby bases and boycotting the front-line advance.Staff Gen. Anwer Hamid, the commander of the Iraqi Air Force, said that the American airstrikes would continue, with Americans concentrating their attacks during the night for operational reasons.""Their role in this fighting is very important to us,"" he said. ""They have a high number of aircraft and they have good capabilities, they can really help us.""",1.0
Sudan Joins Coalition Against Yemen Rebels:   [Foreign Desk ],,"UNITED NATIONS -- It is an awkward moment.The Arab-led, American-supported coalition seeking to rout Houthi rebels in Yemen includes a man indicted on charges of war crimes and vilified by Washington for more than a decade: President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan.Mr. Bashir's government has said it will join the military offensive to aid its ally, Saudi Arabia, according to reports by the state-owned news agency, perhaps even sending ground troops.In a sign of Sudan's growing ties with Persian Gulf countries, Mr. Bashir met with King Salman of Saudi Arabia on a visit to the kingdom this week, and he is expected to take part in the Arab League summit meeting in Cairo this weekend.Mr. Bashir was in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el Sheikh in mid-March to speak at an investment conference. Secretary of State John Kerry attended that conference, too, but left the audience for a few minutes when Mr. Bashir took the podium.Mr. Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on genocide charges in connection with the conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan.

Egypt is not a member of the court.""Given Sudan's atrocious track record in complying with the laws of war,"" said Philippe Bolopion of Human Rights Watch, the country's ""participation in the Saudi-led coalition only heightens already vivid concerns about the price Yemeni civilians might pay in the course of these military operations.""Photograph Omar Hassan Al-Bashir",1.0
"Opening New Iraq Front, U.S. Strikes ISIS in Tikrit:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDED. BAGHDAD -- American warplanes began airstrikes against Islamic State positions in Tikrit late Wednesday, finally joining a stalled offensive to retake the Iraqi city as American officials sought to seize the initiative from Iran, which had taken a major role in directing the operation.The decision to directly aid the offensive was made by President Obama on Wednesday, American officials said, and represented a significant shift in the Iraqi campaign. For more than three weeks, the Americans had stayed on the sideline of the battle for Tikrit, wary of being in the position of aiding an essentially Iranian-led operation. Senior Iranian officials had been on the scene, and allied Shiite militias had made up the bulk of the force.Mr. Obama approved the airstrikes after a request from Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on the condition that Iranian-backed Shiite militias move aside to allow a larger role for Iraqi government counterterrorism forces that have worked most closely with United States troops, American officials said. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps who has been advising forces around Tikrit, was reported on Sunday to have left the area.The United States has struggled to maintain influence in Iraq, even as Iran has helped direct the war on the ground against the Islamic State. But as the struggles to take Tikrit mounted, with a small band of Islamic State militants holding out against a combined Iraqi force of more than 30,000 for weeks, American officials saw a chance not only to turn the momentum against the Islamic State but to gain an edge against the Iranians.If the Americans did not engage, they feared becoming marginalized by Tehran in a country where they had spilled much blood in the last decade, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.American officials now hope that an American-assisted victory by Mr. Abadi and his forces will politically bolster him and counter the view of Iranian officials, and many Iraqi Shiites, that Iran is Iraq's vital ally. ""Taking back Tikrit is important, but it gives us an opportunity to have our half of the operation win this one,"" one American official said. ""It's somewhat of a gamble.""The administration also hopes that a Tikrit victory with American air power will ensure that it is their coalition with Mr. Abadi's forces, and not the faction led by Mr. Suleimani, that then proceeds to try to recapture the larger and more pivotal city of Mosul.But by most accounts, such an operation is months in the future, at least, as officials and analysts agree the assembled force around Tikrit would be inadequate to take Mosul. Officials are scrambling to train more Iraqi soldiers for a push on Mosul, and especially to include more Sunni Arab forces in the offensive. Tikrit and Mosul are heavily Sunni cities, and there are widespread concerns that using predominantly Shiite forces in the campaigns could lead to sectarian abuses. Further, it is not clear that Mr. Abadi has the political strength or will to keep reining in the militiamen or Iran's influence, both which have powerful sway in his Shiite political coalition.The White House made no comment and instead left it to the Pentagon to announce the new airstrikes against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. ""These strikes are intended to destroy ISIL strongholds with precision, thereby saving innocent Iraqi lives while minimizing collateral damage to infrastructure,"" Lt. Gen. James L. Terry, the commander of the Islamic State operation, said in a statement. ""This will further enable Iraqi forces under Iraqi command to maneuver and defeat ISIL in the vicinity of Tikrit.""Mr. Abadi hailed the strikes in a speech broadcast on Iraqi state television from Baghdad on Wednesday night. ""The time of freedom has just been started,"" he said. He continued, ""We announce today what we have promised you yesterday, that we are going to liberate and clear each spot of our territory, and ISIS won't have a foothold on Iraq's land.""But Shiite militia figures have criticized any outreach toward the United States. ""Some of the weaklings in the army say that we need the Americans, but we say we do not need the Americans,"" Hadi al-Ameri, the prominent leader of the group of Shiite militias known here as popular mobilization committees, said last week.The battle for Tikrit, an important city north of Baghdad in Iraq's Sunni heartland, has powerful resonance because its capture last year was seen as a sign of the Islamic State's ascendance. Complete control of Tikrit would give Iraqi forces command of a vital cluster of road networks and would be the first major success in rolling back last year's lightning offensive that brought Islamic State forces within a short drive from the capital.The offensive began March 2, with officials making repeated claims that the city would be reclaimed within days. Then in recent days, officials have said they preferred to consolidate their gains rather than risk more civilian casualties by continuing to press their attack.The preponderance of the 30,000 fighters on the Iraqi side have been members of the militias, fighting alongside Iraqi soldiers and policemen. The Iraqi government has tried to broaden the offensive to include more Sunnis, but the force remains largely Shiite.At Friday Prayer in Karbala last week, a sermon by Sheikh Abdul Mehdi al-Karbalaee, a representative of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the powerful spiritual leader of Iraq's Shiites, pointedly called for more unity and better organization in the fight in Tikrit. That was widely taken as implicit criticism of the offensive's lack of success.The representative also said that fighters should refrain from flying Shiite religious banners, suggesting that better efforts should be made to involve Sunnis in the fight.Last Sunday, Mr. Ameri, the militia organizer, praised Mr. Suleimani, the Iranian commander, for his help in Tikrit but said that he had left the area. ""Qassem Suleimani is here whenever we need him,"" Mr. Ameri said at a news conference at Camp Ashraf, a militia base north of Baghdad. ""He was giving very good advice. The battle ended now, and he returned to his operational headquarters.""Mr. Abadi asked the ambassador Stuart E. Jones and Brett McGurk, the deputy special envoy for the battle with the Islamic State, for American help with the Tikrit offensive last week. The American side insisted that it could help only if operations were coordinated by a joint center with the American military in Baghdad and if there were clear targets.The Americans wanted to work with Iraqi forces they had helped train and insisted on ""deconflicting"" with the Iranian-backed militias so they would not bomb them by mistake, American officials said. The Shiite militias have generally been on the east side of the Tigris River, the officials said, so it should be possible to avoid any errors.Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke with Mr. Abadi by telephone, and Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, the head of Central Command, developed a plan for strikes and concluded that the Iraqis had met the Americans' condition, the officials said. Although Mr. Obama does not personally sign off on most airstrikes in the fight with the Islamic State, he was brought this decision for approval because it represented a more complicated shift in policy.American officials seemed heartened that Mr. Abadi had made a point of calling the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey last weekend to reassure them that once the Islamic State is rooted out of Tikrit, the Sunni city would be returned to the control of its Sunni police, not dominated by Shiite forces.But even the addition of American air power did not guarantee victory. Although the Islamic State has a relatively small force in Tikrit, American officials said they had booby-trapped many of the houses, and an all-out raid to drive them out could be costly.""It's a pretty gnarly situation for anybody going in there,"" one of the officials said.",1.0
Saudis Hit Yemen With Air Assault:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Saudi Arabia announced on Wednesday night that it had launched a military campaign in Yemen, the beginning of what a Saudi official said was an offensive to restore a Yemeni government that had collapsed after rebel forces took control of large swaths of the country.The air campaign began as the internal conflict in Yemen showed signs of degenerating into a proxy war between regional powers. The Saudi announcement came during a rare news conference in Washington by Adel al-Jubeir, the kingdom's ambassador to the United States.Mr. Jubeir said that the Saudis were part of a coalition of approximately 10 nations determined to blunt the advance of Shiite Houthi rebels, who have overrun Yemen's capital and forced the American-backed government into a full retreat.""We will do whatever it takes to protect the legitimate government of Yemen,"" said Mr. Jubeir, who spoke to reporters shortly after the air campaign had begun.Mr. Jubeir did not name the other countries involved in the military campaign, but said the coalition included other Persian Gulf nations. He said that American military forces were not involved in the airstrikes, but that the Saudis had consulted ""very closely"" with the Obama administration before launching the offensive.The Saudi-led campaign began as fighters and army units allied with the Houthi movement threatened to overrun the southern port of Aden, where the besieged president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has gone into hiding.Yemen shares a long border with Saudi Arabia, a major American ally, and the Saudis had been reported to be massing forces on the Yemen frontier as Mr. Hadi's last redoubt in Aden looked increasingly imperiled.The rapid advances by the president's opponents included the seizure of a military air base and an aerial assault on his home. There were unconfirmed reports that the president had fled the country by boat for Djibouti, the tiny Horn of Africa nation across the Gulf of Aden.The region's most impoverished country, Yemen has been a central theater of the American fight against Al Qaeda, and its possible collapse presents complex challenges to the Obama administration as it struggles to deal with instability and radical extremism in the Middle East. In 2011, the Central Intelligence Agency built a base in the southern desert of Saudi Arabia to launch drone strikes in Yemen.Along with Syria, Iraq and Libya, Yemen is now the fourth state to veer toward political disintegration in the aftermath of the Arab Spring revolts, which first erupted four years ago.By Wednesday morning, Houthi forces had seized Al Anad air base, which until recently had been used by American counterterrorism forces, about 35 miles from Mr. Hadi's refuge in Aden, the country's second-largest city.A television network under Houthi control said the rebel forces had found the base empty and looted, and had captured two senior officers loyal to Mr. Hadi, including his defense minister. A security official of Mr. Hadi's government confirmed the loss of Al Anad.Yemeni Air Force planes under Houthi control also struck targets near the president's Aden home, and his supporters returned fire with antiaircraft guns. The state television network, also controlled by Houthis, announced a $100,000 bounty for Mr. Hadi's arrest as rumors about his whereabouts swirled. By nightfall, there were reports that Houthi forces were fighting around the Aden airport, on the outskirts of the city.Shortly after the Saudi strikes began, witnesses in Sana, the capital, reported that bombing had begun at the airport and that electrical power had been cut.A spokeswoman for the National Security Council said Wednesday night that the United States was providing intelligence and logistical support for the campaign in Yemen, and that President Obama had authorized a ""joint planning cell"" with Saudi Arabia to coordinate American support for the military offensive.Mr. Hadi's foreign minister reiterated his calls for intervention by Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other Arab states to stop the Houthis, stoking fears that their advance could set off a widening conflict.The country appeared to be sliding toward a civil war as dangerous as any in the region, with elements of a sectarian feud, a regional proxy conflict, the attempted return of an ousted authoritarian and the expansion of anti-Western extremist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State that are eager to capitalize on the chaos.The Houthis, a minority religious group from northern Yemen, practice a variant of Shiite Islam and receive support from Iran. But they are also collaborating with Yemeni security forces still loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the longtime strongman who was pushed from power amid the Arab Spring uprising but now appears to be orchestrating a comeback in alliance with the Houthis.With Mr. Saleh's help, the Houthis now control most of the Yemeni military, including its air force. That has given them a decisive advantage over Mr. Hadi's forces, as their seizure of the air base on Wednesday made clear.But their ability to control and govern their expanding territory remains far from clear. ""I would not be surprised if we see Aden falling to the Houthis tomorrow,"" said Ibrahim Sharqieh, deputy director of the Brookings Doha Center. ""But that will just set the stage for a prolonged conflict or civil war, because the Houthis have not been able to maintain order even in the areas they have controlled since last year.""Mr. Hadi was installed as a replacement for Mr. Saleh in a transition brokered by Persian Gulf monarchies, and he has the backing of both Saudi Arabia and Washington. But he fled to Aden from Sana after the Houthis captured it months ago. His last vestiges of support and protection appeared to be only a small number of military units and some tribal groups based in the predominantly Sunni Muslim south.As Mr. Hadi's opponents have cornered him, his supporters have escalated calls for Saudi Arabia, the other Persian Gulf states and Egypt to intervene to hold back the Houthis, portraying them as an arm of Iran.Saudi Arabia has fought military battles in Yemen before. In 1934, Ibn Saud, the founder of the Saudi kingdom, fought Yemen's king, Iman Yahya, in what was essentially a dispute over territory in the mountainous region along the coast of the Red Sea.Saudi Arabia was drawn into another conflict against the Houthis in 2009, at that time intervening in support of Mr. Saleh. The fighting had lasted only a few months, but the Saudi military suffered more than 130 casualties, leading many analysts to conclude that the Saudis would resist a repeat of the experience in another war against the Houthis.At the Arab League on Wednesday, officials said that Yemen would top the agenda at a meeting this week in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt.Against the backdrop of the escalating conflict, Sunni Muslim extremists pledging allegiance to both Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have been escalating their attacks, including sectarian assaults on the Houthis. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed responsibility for two bombings of Shiite mosques in Sana on Friday that killed more than 135 people. Al Qaeda's affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, already effectively controls pockets of southern Yemen beyond the reach of either Mr. Hadi or the Houthis.The United States evacuated its military personnel from Al Anad several days ago, as fighters from Al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate moved closer from one side and Houthi fighters pushed closer from the other. About 100 American personnel, including Special Forces commandos, were reportedly stationed there before the evacuation.",1.0
Dozens Are Reported Killed as Saudi-Led Strike Hits Camp for Displaced Yemeni Civilians:   [Foreign Desk ],,"AL MUKALLA, Yemen -- Dozens of civilians were killed when, according to aid workers and officials, what appeared to be an airstrike hit a camp for displaced families in northern Yemen on Monday. It was thought to be the deadliest single episode involving civilians since Saudi Arabia began a military campaign to drive back the Houthi movement five days earlier.The deaths, in the Al-Mazraq camp, came as the Saudi-led Arab military coalition intensified attacks across Yemen, bombing multiple targets including a missile depot in the capital, Sana, that erupted in a nighttime conflagration and sent civilians in a nearby village fleeing the explosions, according to witnesses.Saudi officials have framed their military offensive as an effort to roll back the gains of the Houthis, whose fighters have seized control of much of Yemen over the last seven months, and to restore to power the exiled government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The Saudi offensive has been primarily driven by a fear of Iranian influence in the region: the Houthis, who practice a strain of Shiite Islam and are supported by Iran, have been accused by Saudi officials as acting as an Iranian proxy force.Yet the military action, which has come with the threat of a ground invasion by Saudi and other Arab troops, has raised concerns that it will only further destabilize Yemen, the region's most impoverished country as well as a haven for a powerful Al Qaeda affiliate.Already, the chaos has caused the Obama administration to withdraw its last remaining counterterrorism advisers from Yemen. As the Saudi-led coalition has tightened its military grip on the country -- restricting access by sea and air, while widening its airstrikes -- there are growing fears of a humanitarian emergency, according to aid workers.In Riyadh, the Saudi capital, a spokesman for the military coalition told reporters that naval forces were blocking the movement of ships to thwart weapons and fighters from entering or leaving. Al Ahram, the main Egyptian state newspaper, said warships from Egypt, part of the Saudi coalition, were shelling Houthi fighters to stop their advance into Aden, the southern port that is one of the last refuges of fighters loyal to Mr. Hadi.By nighttime, huge explosions were seen rocking Sana, in what witnesses described as Saudi airstrikes on caches of missiles in a military base on a mountain -- presumably to prevent the Houthis from using them. Images of fireballs from the bombings were posted on Twitter and other social media forums. It was not immediately clear whether the blasts caused any casualties.Earlier in the day, Saudi jets seeking out gatherings of Houthi fighters apparently missed their targets and hit the Al-Mazraq displaced-persons camp, said a senior security official in the area, Saleh Al Mougbili. International relief agencies at the camp also described the attack as an airstrike.There was no comment from Saudi Arabia on the Al-Mazraq bombing, which caused at least 31 deaths, by Mr. Mougbili's account. The International Organization for Migration, which had field workers at the camp, said at least 40 people were killed, mostly civilians. Dozens were wounded, according to the organization and Doctors Without Borders, which treated victims.""People in Al-Mazraq camp have been living in very harsh conditions since 2009, and now they have suffered the consequences of an airstrike on the camp,"" Pablo Marco, the Doctors Without Borders operational manager for Yemen, said in a statement.Al-Mazraq, in Hajja Province, was established in 2001 by the United Nations and has housed hundreds of families whose lives have been upended by the country's chronic conflicts. The camp houses about 5,000 people, said Joel A. Millman, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, a Geneva-based humanitarian group.""We are trying to learn more about the victims, whether all are Yemeni, whether any are aid workers, and so on,"" Mr. Millman said in an emailed statement.The Saudi-backed Yemeni government, which has largely been driven from power, its top officials in exile, denied that any coalition airstrike had been carried out on the camp.The Yemeni foreign minister, Riyadh Yaseen, was quoted by Reuters as saying in Saudi Arabia that explosions at the camp had been caused by artillery strikes from Houthi fighters.At least two other strikes from Saudi jets on Monday may also have missed their intended targets, hitting a gathering of anti-Houthi tribesmen in the southern province of Shabwa, killing three, local tribal leaders said.",1.0
Saudis Make Own Moves as U.S. and Iran Talk:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. CAIRO -- As America talks to Iran, Saudi Arabia is lashing out against it.The kingdom, Iran's chief regional rival, is leading airstrikes against an Iranian-backed faction in Yemen; backing a blitz in Idlib, Syria, by jihadists fighting the Iranian-backed Assad regime; and warning Washington not to allow the Iranian-backed militia to capture too much of Iraq during the fight to roll back the Islamic State, according to Arab diplomats familiar with the talks.Through Egypt, a major beneficiary of Saudi aid, the kingdom is backing plans for a combined Arab military force to combat Iranian influence around the region. With another major aid recipient, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia is also expected to step up its efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, potentially setting off an arms race in the region.All this comes just a few weeks after the death of King Abdullah and the passing of the throne to a new ruler, King Salman, who then installed his son Mohammed, who is 29 or 30, in the powerful dual roles of defense minister and chief of the royal court.""Taking matters into our own hands is the name of the game today,"" said Jamal Khashoggi, a veteran Saudi journalist and former adviser to the government. ""A deal will open up the Saudi appetite and the Turkish appetite for more nuclear programs. But for the time being Saudi Arabia is moving ahead with its operations to pull the carpet out from underneath the Iranians in our region.""With the approach of a self-imposed Tuesday night deadline for the framework of a nuclear deal between Iran and the Western powers, the talks themselves are already changing the dynamics of regional politics.The proposed deal would trade relief from economic sanctions on Iran for insurance against the risk that Iran might rapidly develop a nuclear bomb. But many Arab analysts and diplomats say that security against the nuclear risk may come at the cost of worsening ongoing conflicts around the Middle East as Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Muslim allies push back against what they see as efforts by Shiite-led Iran to impose its influence -- often on sectarian battle lines.Unless Iran pulls back, ""you will see more direct Arab responses and you will see a higher level of geopolitical tension in the whole region,"" argued Nabil Fahmy, a veteran Egyptian diplomat and former foreign minister.In Yemen, where a bombing campaign by a Saudi-led coalition killed dozens of civilians in an errant strike on a camp for displaced families, the Saudis accuse Iran of supporting the Houthi movement, which follows a form of Shiite Islam and recently came close to taking control of the country's four largest cities. (Western diplomats say Iran has provided money to the group but does not control it.) In Bahrain, across a short causeway from Saudi Arabia, the kingdom and its allies accuse Iran of backing opposition from the Shiite majority against the Sunni monarchy.And Iran has also cultivated clients in government in the great Arab capitals of Damascus, Baghdad and Beirut, the last through its proxy, Hezbollah.Even if the proposed deal constrains Iran's nuclear ambitions, the Saudis and their allies note, the pact would do nothing to stop Iran from projecting its influence through such local proxies and conventional arms. Sanctions relief from the deal could even revive the Iranian economy with a flood of new oil revenues.""The Americans seem nonchalant about this, like, 'This is your sectarian problem, you deal with it,' "" Mr. Khashoggi said. ""So the Saudis went ahead with this Yemen operation.""Watching Secretary of State John Kerry pursue a deal in Lausanne, Switzerland, many in Saudi Arabia and other Arab states say their ultimate fear is that the talks could lead to a broader détente or even alliance between Washington and Tehran.Washington is already tacitly coordinating with Iran in its fight against ISIS in Iraq. As a result, the American-led military campaign is effectively strengthening the Iranian-backed government in Syria by weakening its most dangerous foe, Arab diplomats and analysts say.So they wonder what else Mr. Kerry is talking about with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, ""on those long walks together"" in Lausanne, said Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center, in Qatar. ""Is there something going on underneath the table?""Easing the hostility between the United States and Iran would tear up what has been a bedrock principle of regional politics since the Iranian revolution and the storming of the American embassy in 1979. ""But let's not forget that we are still dealing with the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" Mr. Shaikh said, reflecting the skeptical views of many in the Saudi Arabian camp.""There is a disbelief in the Arab world that these negotiations are only about the nuclear file, and a frequent complaint here is that we are kept in the dark, we are not consulted,"" said Gamal Abdel Gawad Soltan, a political scientist at the American University in Cairo. ""The U.S. is much less trusted as an ally, as an insurance policy towards the security threats facing the governments in the region, and so those governments decide to act on their own.""President Obama has argued that a verifiable deal is the best way to secure the Arab states because it is the most effective way to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear bomb. Even military action to take out Iran's nuclear facilities, the Obama administration argues, would set it back only temporarily.Some analysts further maintain that a nuclear deal could induce Tehran to adopt a less confrontational foreign policy as well, by engaging it in economic and diplomatic relations with the West and, eventually, its neighbors. If Iran were less of a pariah, it would have more to lose, argued Lina Khatib, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. ""An engaged Iran is a less threatening Iran,"" she said. ""I think a nuclear deal with Iran will have a calming impact on the region.""But she acknowledged that at the moment Saudi Arabia and its allies did not see it that way. ""The Saudi and Iranian rivalry is being played out now in a hot war in Iraq, in Syria and now in Yemen,"" she said. ""The confrontation is causing people on both sides to dig into their sectarian positions.""Aversion to the Iran deal in the Saudi camp is also representative of the latest convergence of views with the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been deeply critical of the nuclear pact. But ""they can be on the same side without necessarily talking,"" said Mr. Soltan of the American University in Cairo.Whether an Iran deal is consummated or not, he and several other analysts said, the negotiations have contributed to a divergence with the Obama administration and a growing desire for greater autonomy among the Sunni Arab states.Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies bucked the Obama administration to sponsor the military takeover and repression of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in 2013, for example. And last year the United Arab Emirates carried out airstrikes from Egyptian bases against Islamist allied militias in Tripoli, Libya, without notifying Washington. Some American diplomats were so incredulous that the U.A.E. acted on its own that they doubted early reports until a second set of strikes confirmed them.""There are issues that you cannot expect a superpower to engage in directly because of their own politics and interests, and if you don't have the capabilities or the initiatives to deal with them yourself then you are not providing enough of a deterrent to other regional players,"" said Mr. Fahmy, the former Egyptian foreign minister. He added, speaking of Arab relations with Washington, ""There is a difference between a security relationship and a security addiction.""Mr. Khashoggi, the Saudi editor, argued that Saudi Arabia's own campaign to push back against Iran without waiting for the Americans was showing signs of success. Saudi Arabian and Turkish sponsors, he said, had backed the coalition of jihadist groups that recently captured the Syrian city of Idlib in the first major victory in months against the government of President Bashar al-Assad.One participant in the coalition was the Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of Al Qaeda, a terrorist group in the eyes of the West. But members of the jihadi coalition ""are the ones who captured Idlib, it is an important development, and I think we are going to see more of that,"" Mr. Khashoggi said. ""Coordination between Turkish and Saudi intelligence has never been as good as now.""The after-the-fact American support for the military campaign in Yemen, he said, was also a reassuring sign that Washington was willing to back Saudi leadership as it pushes back against Iran across the region. ""The Americans are going along with that,"" he said.The operation ""proved that a regional power can lead, they do not have to wait for America,"" he said, ""and if the issue is moral or justified, America will get on board.""",1.0
"In Blow to Syrian Insurgents, Airstrike Is Said to Kill Rebel Leader:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The commander of one of the most powerful Syrian insurgent groups in the suburbs of the Syrian capital, Damascus, was killed Friday in an airstrike, according to the government and its opponents. The death of the commander, Zahran Alloush, is a significant blow to the armed opposition, bolstering President Bashar al-Assad ahead of a planned new round of peace talks.Mr. Alloush led the Army of Islam, a group that had recently agreed to participate in a political process seeking to end the five-year-old conflict. The Army of Islam is regarded by the Syrian government and its most powerful ally, Russia, as a sectarian, terrorist group that differs little from more extremist groups like the Islamic State.Local opposition figures reached in Damascus said the airstrikes had been carried out by Russian warplanes, but that information was not immediately confirmed by Russian or Syrian officials.Analysts said the strikes were in keeping with longstanding efforts by the Syrian government and its allies to eliminate groups claiming to occupy a middle ground between Mr. Assad and the Islamic State. The efforts are part of a broader objective to improve Mr. Assad's standing among Western governments, which despise him but also see the Islamic State as an increasing menace.The Army of Islam sent members to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, this month for talks among opposition groups aimed at choosing representatives for a third round of international peace talks, scheduled for early 2016.Mr. Alloush and his faction had not been universally accepted in the Syrian opposition -- they are widely blamed for the disappearance of four secular opposition activists from the Damascus suburb of Douma. But unlike harder-line armed groups, the Army of Islam has shown a recent interest in taking part in politics, said Ibrahim Hamidi, a Syrian correspondent for Al Hayat, a pan-Arab newspaper.Mr. Hamidi, who opposes the Syrian government, said that by having successfully targeted Mr. Alloush, Mr. Assad and his Russian allies had demonstrated their desire to pursue a military solution. ""This is a rejection of the Riyadh talks,"" he said.The Army of Islam controls much of the urban sprawl east of Damascus known as East Ghouta, an area that has been under blockade and bombardment by government forces for the better part of four years.Government supporters welcomed Mr. Alloush's death, blaming him for periodic shelling of civilian areas in Damascus. Government opponents said he had been instrumental in restraining more extremist groups from unleashing worse attacks on the city.The opponents also argue that the Army of Islam, which sees the Islamic State as an enemy and competitor, has been crucial in keeping that group from encroaching closer to Damascus, and that weakening it could open the door to advances by the fighters of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL.The Army of Islam could be particularly vulnerable because it was organized around a single charismatic individual, more so than many other rebel groups.""Big day for supporters of ISIS and the Assad regime,"" Hassan Hassan, a co-author of ""ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror,"" posted on Twitter, adding that Mr. Alloush's group was ""without a doubt one of the very earliest"" of Syrian insurgent movements ""to systematically fight ISIS & its cells.""At the same time, Mr. Alloush had enemies and critics among fellow opponents of the government. Some insurgents have long accused him of making lucrative deals with the government or hoarding Saudi-supplied arms rather than using them to help overmatched insurgents in other areas around Damascus.Mr. Alloush, a religiously conservative Sunni Muslim, had a history of making sectarian statements. But after having met with American officials recently, he softened his tone.In interviews with the McClatchy news service he denounced sectarian or partisan rule of Syria, and said he believed that the country should be governed by a ""technocratic, professional"" body.His faction had allowed a group of secular activists from Damascus, including Razan Zeitouneh, an award-winning human rights lawyer, to be based in Douma, but in 2013 they were kidnapped after having criticized the Army of Islam.Mr. Alloush recently denied that his group had been behind their disappearance, but his death leaves friends of the missing activists concerned that they have lost their main channel for recovering them.The strike on Mr. Alloush -- which activists said took place as he met with another insurgent group, Ahrar al-Sham -- came as Islamic State fighters prepared to evacuate from the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk, south of Damascus, in a deal involving the government, the Islamic State, other Syrian insurgent groups, Palestinian factions and the United Nations.The details of the deal remained unclear, but part of the objective was to allow some civilians to leave the camp and to increase humanitarian access to it. Thousands of people face severe hunger and unsanitary conditions in the camp, which has long been besieged.The deal also was said to involve safe passage for Islamic State fighters inside Yarmouk to the group's headquarters in Raqqa in eastern Syria.",1.0
,,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- Besieged Afghan forces were struggling to head off a complete Taliban takeover of the critical southern district of Sangin on Tuesday, and a new deployment of British troops was rushed in to help direct an increasingly pressed battle across the surrounding province of Helmand.A small contingent of British forces in an advisory role arrived at Camp Shorabak, the largest British military base in Afghanistan before it was handed over to the Afghan forces last year, Britain's Defense Ministry said in a statement.""They are not deployed in a combat role and will not deploy outside the camp,"" the statement said.The new deployment, which Afghan officials said included about 40 people, was in addition to an influx of American Special Operations forces that deployed to Helmand when the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, was on the verge of falling several weeks ago.The Western deployment comes as Sangin, a Taliban stronghold for years, appeared close to a complete takeover by the Taliban after weeks of heavy fighting there and in neighboring districts.Ebadullah Alizai, a member of the provincial council in Helmand, said much of the Sangin district center was under Taliban control, with an Afghan Army unit surrounded and in urgent need of reinforcements.But attempts to get the extra troops to Sangin were being slowed by roadside bombs, he said.Sangin has been one of the deadliest Afghan battlegrounds for British and American troops throughout the war. Within months of the NATO transfer of security control to Afghan forces there, the district began coming under heavy insurgent pressure.The Afghan forces have been mostly penned into their bases there over the past year. But in recent weeks, the situation became even worse, as police forces began taking witheringly heavy casualties, Afghan officials said. By Tuesday, the remaining police contingent and members of the civilian government had retreated from the district center and were surrounded at an army base about two miles away, said Abdul Bashir Shakir, head of the security committee at the provincial council.""The reinforcements have been sent, but heavy I.E.D.s about four kilometers from the district center stopped their approach,"" Mr. Shakir said.Still, officials said there were no coalition forces in Sangin itself, as they were focused on assisting the broader fight across Helmand Province.The Taliban has made huge strides in its Helmand offensive this year. For months, Afghan forces have been struggling to repel Taliban advances across several districts, including Khan Neshin, Gereshk, Marja, Kajaki and Washir. The insurgents have made it as close as three miles from Lashkar Gah, in the suburb of Babaji, where fighting has gone on for weeks.""We have severe challenges in 13 districts, only Garmsir and Nawa districts are calm at the moment,"" Mr. Alizai said.The largest province in Afghanistan in terms of territory, Helmand holds great symbolic value both to the Taliban and the Afghan government and its Western backers.It was at the heart of President Obama's troop surge after he took office, where fresh American forces and resources were rushed in to try to break the Taliban's hold. British troops also fought bloody battles there, suffering some of their worst casualties.For the Taliban, Helmand is a crucial prize because of its resources. The province produces the biggest opium poppy harvest in Afghanistan, and its deserts fall right on the lucrative trafficking route that the Taliban have increasingly exploited. One of Afghanistan's biggest marble mines is also in Helmand, with the Taliban profiting from the royalties.The province shares a long and fluid border with Pakistan, where most of the Taliban's senior leadership lives. Some Afghan officials believe the insurgents have pushed harder for Helmand this year specifically to create a haven and operational headquarters in Afghanistan, allowing their leaders to come back into the country.Much of the Helmand offensive has been waged by fighters loyal to Mullah Qayum Zakir, a former Guantánamo Bay inmate who is considered one of the architects of the Taliban resurgence and is a leading rival to the new Taliban supreme leader, Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour.Even as the Taliban's southern offensive has gained ground, so have their military pushes in eastern Afghanistan, and in the north as well, where they briefly occupied the provincial capital of Kunduz in September.The broad pattern of fighting has desperately stretched the Afghan forces in a year when NATO air support was wound down with the end of the formal combat mission in 2014, Afghan officials say.",1.0
Turkey Moves to Clamp Down on Its Borders:   [Foreign Desk ],,"IZMIR, Turkey -- The Turkish Coast Guard has stepped up nighttime patrols on the choppy, wintry waters of the Aegean Sea, seizing rafts full of refugees fleeing war for Europe and sending them back to Turkey.Down south, at the border with Syria, Turkey is building a concrete wall, digging trenches, laying razor wire and at night illuminating vast stretches of land in an effort to cut off the flow of supplies and foreign fighters to the Islamic State.On land and at sea, Turkey's borders, long a revolving door of refugees, foreign fighters and the smugglers who enable them, are at the center of two separate yet interlinked global crises: the migrant tide convulsing Europe and the Syrian civil war that propels it.Accused by Western leaders of turning a blind eye to these critical borders, Turkey at last seems to be getting serious about shoring them up. Under growing pressure from Europe and the United States, Turkey has in recent weeks taken steps to cut off the flows of refugees and of foreign fighters who have helped destabilize a vast portion of the globe, from the Middle East to Europe.Smugglers who used to make a living helping the Islamic State bring foreign fighters into Syria say that it is increasingly difficult -- though still not impossible -- to do so now. Border guards who once fired warning shots, they say, now shoot to kill.""Whoever approaches the border is shot,"" said Omar, a smuggler interviewed in the border town of Kilis who insisted on being identified by only his first name because of the illegal nature of his work. ""And many have been killed.""Another smuggler, Mustafa, who also agreed to speak if only his first name was used, said, ""Two months ago, you could get in whatever you liked."" He said he used to bring in explosives and foreign fighters for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. That allowed him to continue his regular business of smuggling food and other items, like cigarettes, into Syria. Now, he said, ""the Turkish snipers shoot any moving object.""At the coast, Turkey's efforts to interdict more boats full of migrants came after the European Union agreed to pay Ankara more than $3 billion to help with education and health care for the refugees in the country.Some rights groups have cried foul. Amnesty International recently accused Turkey of illegally detaining migrants and, in some cases, of sending them back to war zones. Turkish officials have said they detain relatively few migrants, and only ones they say have links to smuggling rings.The Basmane neighborhood of this coastal city, the primary hub for migrants on their way to Europe, is quieter than it was during the summer -- not primarily because of any new toughness by the Turks, but because fewer migrants will risk a sea crossing during the winter, when the waters are rougher. Smugglers' fees have lately dropped to as low as $500 per person from about $1,200 because of the lower demand.On a recent afternoon here, Bilal Barghoud, a 19-year-old Syrian, sat in a dingy guesthouse. Scrawled on the wall, in Arabic, was, ""We have vests and inner tubes,"" and, ""Tea for 1 Turkish lira."" Mr. Barghoud had just returned from a harrowing night at sea.The trip began smoothly, he said, but as they drew closer to Greece, the waves grew higher. Then, just a few minutes from the beaches of Greece, a Turkish Coast Guard cutter appeared.""Everyone was saying, 'Oh, in 10 minutes we'll be in Greece,' "" he said. ""And then that ship showed up. Everyone was afraid.""The Turks brought them back to the port and also confiscated their life jackets.Now, he said, they were waiting for a new night and another shot at crossing to Greece. Their wait was not long. The next morning, having successfully evaded the Turks, they were safely on the shores of Europe.American and European leaders have complained for years that Turkey's border policy inflamed the Syrian civil war and enabled the rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State. Determined to see the overthrow of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, it allowed a virtually free flow of weapons and fighters across its lands.Turkish officials have rejected such criticism, often blaming Western ""Islamophobia"" and European governments' treatment of their own Muslim populations for the copious flow of foreigners passing through Turkey to join the Islamic State.While American officials say Turkey has improved in numerous ways -- for instance, it has created a watch list of 26,000 terrorism suspects and established a new agency to monitor it -- they are still pressuring the country to do more.As Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter flew to Turkey recently to push officials to do more in the fight against the Islamic State, he said of the country, ""The single most important contribution that their geography makes necessary is the control of their own border.""In recent weeks, the United States has increased airstrikes on the last stretch of Islamic State-held territory along the Turkish border: a 61-mile strip of land west of the Euphrates River. This is the area where last summer the United States and Turkey spoke publicly of a deal to clear the area of the Islamic State, but the two sides disagreed on what to call it -- the Americans said ""ISIS-free zone"" and the Turks a ""safe zone"" -- and the idea seemed to fade.Now, after the recent Islamic State-inspired terrorist attacks in France and the United States, the two countries have renewed cooperative efforts to seal that final stretch.Despite the Turkish crackdown, foreign fighters are still able to reach the Islamic State. According to a recent report by the Soufan Group, a political risk firm based in New York, the Islamic State now has from 27,000 to 31,000 foreign fighters, more than double the estimate the firm published in June 2013.Richard Barrett, senior vice president at the Soufan Group, said that while the Turks were doing a lot more, there were still effective smuggling routes for the Islamic State. He said there were some reports that the group faced a shortage of manpower, but nevertheless the numbers of foreign fighters show that ""they are still able to get people in.""With 2.2 million Syrians, and tens of thousands more Iraqis, Turkey hosts more refugees than any other country. But as it has moved to clamp down on its southern border, critics say it has also closed its doors to new refugees. Many of these are currently fleeing Russian airstrikes in rebel-held areas of Syria and finding themselves trapped by Turkey's closed doors.Now, to reach safety, these refugees say, they have to be smuggled multiple times: from Islamic State-held areas to rebel territory, and then to Turkey, before they even consider the sea journey to Europe. Omar, the smuggler, said that thousands of desperate Syrians would cross in to Turkey if it reopened its border crossings.Turkish officials, though, say that the country's policy toward refugees has not changed.""We will still keep our open-door policy,"" said a senior Turkish official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. ""But obviously the security situation on the ground changed.""As refugees here wait to leave, they worry about the rough seas and the Turkish Coast Guard, but also about how they will be treated, as Muslims, in Europe in the aftermath of the Paris attacks.""In Europe, as Muslims, we will be treated badly,"" said Amir Kuatbi, who left Damascus, Syria's capital, in recent weeks to escape army conscription and who was hoping to reach Sweden. But in Turkey, he said, ""there is no future.""He chose Europe, and the day after he spoke, he arrived in Greece, on his way to Sweden.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

U.S. Troops Sent to Syria to Aid Forces Fighting ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- President Obama announced on Friday that he had ordered several dozen Special Operations troops into Syria for the first open-ended mission by United States ground forces in that country, deepening American involvement in a war he has tried to avoid for more than four years.While the deployment was small in scale, it was large in importance for a president who had refused to commit American ground forces inside Syria beyond quick raids. White House officials said the troops would advise local forces fighting the Islamic State and not play a direct combat role, but they left open the possibility of sending more in the future.The escalation came just weeks after Russia inserted itself into the multisided civil war to support President Bashar al-Assad, bombing opposition forces, including some supported by the United States. Although not characterized as a response, the dispatch of American troops further complicates a kaleidoscopic battlefield with varied forces and sometimes murky allegiances.The move was meant to bolster diplomatic efforts by Secretary of State John Kerry, who on Friday reached an agreement in Vienna with countries with opposing stakes to explore ""a nationwide cease-fire"" and ask the United Nations to oversee the revision of the Syrian Constitution and then new elections. The accord represented the first time all the major outside participants had agreed on the start of a political process to bring the war to an end.But a truce remained elusive and the president's military move was the latest incremental step into the expanding conflict in Syria and next-door Iraq. Once intent on just using American airpower to help local forces on the ground, Mr. Obama has now sent 3,500 American troops to Iraq. An American soldier was killed in a commando raid last week, the first such casualty since the fight against the Islamic State began last year.The troops heading to Syria will number ""fewer than 50,"" the White House said, but Pentagon officials said even those numbers would be useful in coordinating efforts with Kurdish forces. Republicans argued it was too little and too late to make a meaningful difference, while some Democrats said it pushed the United States further down a slippery slope into a hopeless war.The White House insisted this was not a case of mission creep. ""The mission has not changed,"" said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. ""These forces,"" he added, ""do not have a combat mission.""""The responsibility that they have is not to lead the charge to take a hill, but rather to offer advice and assistance to those local forces about the best way they can organize their efforts to take the fight to ISIL or to take the hill inside of Syria,"" he said.But the definition of combat has shifted since the United States last year began taking on the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL. In May, Delta Force commandos entered Syria aboard Black Hawk helicopters and V-22 Ospreys and killed an Islamic State leader and about a dozen militant fighters. The soldier killed last week was part of a force accompanying Kurdish commandos on a raid to free prisoners held by the Islamic State.In addition to the Special Operations deployment, Mr. Obama authorized deploying A-10 and F-15 warplanes to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. The A-10s are capable of providing close in-air support to fighters on the ground. The F-15s can carry out a range of air-to-ground combat missions.Mr. Obama, who spoke with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq on Friday, instructed advisers to consult the Baghdad government about establishing a Special Operations task force to further efforts to target Islamic State leaders there. He also ordered more military assistance to Jordan and Lebanon.The Pentagon wants to build a firewall behind forces allied with the United States -- both the Kurds and the Syrian-Arab coalition backed by Mr. Obama -- to allow these fighters to hold territory they have captured. Part of the way to do that, one Defense Department official said, is to ensure that equipment is delivered and that subsequent supplies will reach these forces quickly.The shift represents ""a kind of Goldilocks policy -- not too hot and not too cold,"" said Aaron David Miller, a vice president with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""Keep your eye on ISIS, keep your forces out of Russia's way and yet enhance your profile after Moscow has raised theirs.""At the moment, officials said there was no plan to send the American troops beyond a makeshift opposition group headquarters in northern Syria. They will not patrol or travel with opposition groups. Officials, though, also said that could change as the situation warrants. And they said no decision has been made on sending additional Apache helicopters to Iraq.The move could potentially put the American troops in the cross hairs of Russia, which last month began airstrikes on antigovernment forces in Syria. A senior Pentagon official said the United States had not informed Moscow about where the American forces will be. ""The area where we are planning to place these special operators is not an area where they have struck or where they would need to strike,"" the official said. ""It's not ISIL or regime-controlled.""But given that most Russian airstrikes have been against opposition groups that are not part of the Islamic State, there is no guarantee that Moscow may not hit groups in which the American forces are embedded. That said, Russia has ""significant visibility"" over what happens in Syria, the official said, adding that if it becomes necessary to keep its troops safe the United States will communicate with Moscow.But Mr. Miller and other foreign policy specialists warned that the move risked alienating Turkey since it will bring American forces into an even closer alliance with northern Syria's Kurdish fighters, including Kurdish People's Protection Units, which have come under attack from Turkey in recent days.Derek Chollet, a former assistant defense secretary under Mr. Obama, said the administration would seek to calm Turkish concern by saying the move would help protect its interests. ""After all, the Turks have wanted U.S. Special Forces on the ground in Syria for years,"" he said.The diplomatic progress reported in Vienna came after seven hours of heated negotiations, punctuated by sharp exchanges between the foreign ministers of Iran and Saudi Arabia. But it amounted to more of an aspiration than a settlement.Mr. Kerry and the other diplomats set no deadline for either the cease-fire or a new constitution and election that would follow, and it remained unclear whether Mr. Assad, who was not invited, or the rebels seeking to overthrow him will agree. But the diplomats will meet again in two weeks to expand on the basic principles issued on Friday night, including a commitment to keep Syria together as a single nation.Mr. Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister, announced the results together, but they remained deeply divided on whether Mr. Assad must step down as part of any final resolution, as the United States and its European and Persian Gulf allies have demanded and Russia and Iran have resisted.""We have no agreement on the destiny of Assad,"" Mr. Lavrov told reporters as he sat next to Mr. Kerry. ""Russia believes that it is up to Syrian people to decide within the framework of the political process.""Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said Mr. Assad's eventual departure remained a necessity. ""As far as we are concerned, we think that Bashar al-Assad has no place in the future of Syria,"" he said.Both Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov said the cease-fire would not apply to the conflict with Islamic State forces. Mr. Lavrov declined to criticize, at least publicly, the American decision to send Special Operations forces to northern Syria. Mr. Kerry told reporters the timing of the announcement was ""a coincidence"" and that he was not aware a decision had been made until earlier Friday.The two men said they discussed coordination of their attacks beyond the narrow conversations about avoiding an accidental conflict. ""We have some ideas which we discussed today that I am taking back to Washington,"" Mr. Kerry said.Still, the tensions in Vienna emphasized how difficult it could be to reach a common understanding. The most heated conversations took place between Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and his Saudi counterpart, Adel al-Jubeir. Until a few days ago, the Saudis refused to sit in the same room with the Iranians and they spent much of the meeting ""voicing grievances and accusations,"" said one official.",1.0
China Building Runway on Contested Island:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIJING -- China is building a concrete runway on an island in the South China Sea's contested waters that will be capable of handling military aircraft when finished, satellite images released Thursday show.The first section of the runway appears like a piece of gray ribbon on an image taken last month of Fiery Cross Reef, part of the Spratly Islands, an archipelago claimed by at least three other countries. Adjacent to the runway, work is underway on an apron for taxiing and parking planes.The runway, which is expected to be about 10,000 feet long -- enough to accommodate fighter jets and surveillance aircraft -- is a game changer in the competition between the United States and China in the South China Sea, said Peter Dutton, professor of strategic studies at the Naval War College in Rhode Island.""This is a major strategic event,"" Mr. Dutton said. ""In order to have sea control, you need to have air control.""Analysts had speculated that China planned to build an airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef, but the satellite image from March 23, provided by Airbus and released Thursday by Jane's Defense Weekly, is the first hard evidence that it is doing so.In time, Mr. Dutton said, China is likely to install radar and missiles that could intimidate countries like the Philippines, an American ally, and Vietnam, which also have claims to the Spratlys, as they resupply modest military garrisons in the area.More broadly, he said, China's ability to use Fiery Cross Reef as a landing strip for fighter and surveillance aircraft will vastly expand its zone of competition with the United States in the South China Sea.Over the past decade and a half, a series of tense encounters between American and Chinese forces on the sea and in the air, starting with a near collision in 2001 between an American EP-3 spy plane and a Chinese fighter, have occurred in the sea's northern waters, near China. The new installations in the Spratlys, about 1,000 miles beyond China's southernmost point on Hainan Island, will create a much wider arena for potential close calls, Mr. Dutton said.""This will expand the area in which there are likely to be tensions between the United States and China,"" he said.The construction on Fiery Cross Reef is part of a larger Chinese reclamation project involving scores of dredgers on at least five islands in the South China Sea. China is converting tiny reefs, once barely visible above water, into islands big enough to handle military hardware, personnel and recreation facilities for workers.Satellite images of the reclamation efforts have been released in steady doses over the last few months, as smaller countries with claims to islands in the area have voiced concern about China's accelerated construction, and as the United States has stepped up its criticism.During his recent first trip to Asia as the American defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter said in Japan that the reclamation efforts were seriously aggravating tensions between Beijing and Washington and hurting prospects for diplomatic solutions.After Mr. Carter spoke, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington research group, released images of Mischief Reef, also in the Spratly archipelago, that showed large-scale dredging of sand and coral to create land mass on what had been a partly submerged reef.The construction on Fiery Cross Reef, hundreds of miles west of Mischief Reef, appears to have taken place in the last several weeks. An Airbus image from Feb. 6, also released Thursday by Jane's Defense Weekly, shows empty sand where the runway is now being built.""We absolutely think it is for military aircraft, but of course an airstrip is an airstrip -- anything can land on it if it's long enough,"" said James Hardy, Asia-Pacific editor for Jane's Defense Weekly. ""Three thousand meters is big enough for pretty much any aircraft."" He noted that the superjumbo Airbus A380's runway requirement is 2,950 meters, or just under 10,000 feet.Other runways used by the Chinese military have ranged from around 8,850 feet to more than 13,100, Mr. Hardy said. By comparison, he said, the runway the United States Air Force maintains at Diego Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean that is much bigger and more developed than Fiery Cross Reef, is 11,800 feet.""The main question is, what else would land there?"" he said. ""Unless they are planning to turn these into resorts -- which seems unlikely, not least given the statement from the Foreign Ministry last week -- then military aircraft are the only things that would need to land there.""China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement last week that the reclamation efforts were intended to serve civilian purposes, such as providing a base for search-and-rescue operations, but also for ""satisfying the need of necessary military defense."" Though the statement placed more emphasis on the nonmilitary goals, it was a rare acknowledgment of Chinese military intentions in the South China Sea.Mr. Hardy said China's military appeared to have chosen Fiery Cross Reef as a command-and-control center for its Spratly Islands operations.China claims more than 80 percent of the South China Sea, arguing that a ""nine-dash line"" that it drew around the waterway in the late 1940s conforms to its rights there. No other country recognizes the validity of the nine-dash line, and many fear that China's reclamation activities are part of a drive to create an inevitability about Chinese ownership.In another example of the Pentagon's growing criticism of China's efforts, a senior Navy commander, Rear Adm. Christopher J. Paul, said last month in Australia that there were countries ""who attempt to constrict movement through international waters, who create land areas where there were none; who create exclusion zones where there should be shared use.""In response, he said, the Navy is creating ""hunter-killer surface action groups"" of ships. He suggested that Australia, one of America's top allies, would be invited to contribute to the new efforts in offensive naval warfare.Photograph Satellite Images Released by Jane's Defense Weekly Show That, Between Feb. 6 and March 23, China Built the First Section of a Concrete Runway On Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands Archipelago, Which at Least Three Other Countries Claim.

U.S. Drone Kills a Top Figure in Al Qaeda's Yemen Branch:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- An American drone strike has killed a top ideologue and spokesman for Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen, the terrorist group announced Tuesday. The spokesman, Ibrahim al-Rubeish, a 35-year-old Saudi citizen, had been held for five years in the United States military prison at Guantánamo Bay.A statement from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, posted on Twitter, said that Mr. Rubeish was killed Monday in what it called a ""hate-filled Crusader strike"" near Al Mukalla, a city on Yemen's southern coast.Since 2009, Mr. Rubeish has been the group's voice in many important pronouncements, including a video eulogy for Anwar al-Awlaki, the American cleric killed in a drone strike in 2011.Mr. Rubeish, the latest of a half-dozen senior Qaeda operatives killed by American strikes in Yemen over the past year, was drawn into the terrorist network as a young man and rose nearly to the top of Al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate. The statement said Mr. Rubeish ""spent nearly two decades as a mujahid,"" an Islamic fighter, ""in the cause of Allah, battling against America and its agents,"" according to a translation by the Site Intelligence Group.American counterterrorism officials say that killing operatives of the Yemen affiliate has kept it off balance, making it harder to plot against the United States. But in the judgment of most experts, the Qaeda branch there is at least as strong as it was before American drone strikes began in Yemen in 2009, in part as a result of political chaos in the country.But Gerald M. Feierstein, a senior diplomat who was ambassador to Yemen from 2010 to 2013, called the death of Mr. Rubeish a ""major setback"" for the Qaeda franchise. He said that he had no details on the attack, but that it appeared to show that the United States could carry out strikes without a stable government in Yemen to offer support.""At this particular moment, they might feel they're operating with a certain level of impunity,"" Mr. Feierstein said of the Qaeda branch, speaking in an interview after a congressional hearing on Yemen. ""If we can deny them that assurance, that's a good thing.""The strike was the first in Yemen in about six weeks, according to independent groups that track counterterrorism strikes. American drones have continued to carry out surveillance flights over Yemen, but strikes slowed last month after the American Embassy was closed and 125 American Special Operations troops were pulled out of an air base in the south.In recent months, Iran-backed Shiite militia forces known as the Houthis have seized the Yemeni capital, Sana, and faced off against Yemen's government and airstrikes carried out by a Saudi-led coalition of Sunni countries. Earlier this month, Qaeda fighters took advantage of disarray among security forces and seized Al Mukalla, looting a bank and freeing hundreds of prisoners.A senior Obama administration official declined to comment on the strike that killed Mr. Rubeish. But the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, made clear that the recent withdrawal did not end American drone operations, which are carried out from bases in Saudi Arabia and Djibouti, in eastern Africa.""We continue to actively monitor terrorist threats emanating from Yemen, and we have capabilities postured in the area to address them,"" the official said.For several years, American counterterrorism officials have seen Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula as the terrorist group posing the greatest threat to the United States. It was responsible for two failed plots to blow up United States-bound airliners: one in 2009 that used explosives hidden in a bomber's underwear, and a foiled attack in 2010 using bombs hidden in printer cartridges addressed to Chicago and sent aboard cargo planes.The life and death of Mr. Rubeish reflected several stages in the struggle of the United States to deal with terrorist suspects since 2001, including his imprisonment at Guantánamo and his participation in a Saudi rehabilitation program for militants, which evidently failed.According to a biography prepared by officials at Guantánamo, Mr. Rubeish was born into a wealthy Saudi family and earned a certificate in Islamic law. He wanted to join the fight against Russian forces in Chechnya, but after traveling to Pakistan for training he was directed to a Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan in May 2001, when he was about 22.After the Sept. 11 attacks, he fought at Tora Bora in Afghanistan and was captured by Pakistani forces and turned over to the United States, arriving at Guantánamo in January 2002. A 2005 assessment judged that he was a member of Al Qaeda who posed a ""medium"" risk and said that he had ""some type of leadership role among detainees and strongly influences them."" He contributed an ""Ode to the Sea"" to a collection of poems by Guantánamo prisoners published in 2007.Earlier in 2005, Mr. Rubeish was among several Guantánamo detainees to challenge their detention with a habeas corpus petition in federal court in Washington. The petition was denied, but in December 2006, the George W. Bush administration sent Mr. Rubeish home to Saudi Arabia on the condition that he enter the rehabilitation program.That program generally has a good reputation among counterterrorism experts, but among its most prominent failures were militants who helped form Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in 2009. The former deputy leader of that Qaeda branch, Saeed al-Shihri, followed the same path from Guantánamo to the Saudi rehab program and then to Yemen, where he died in a drone strike in 2013.Mr. Rubeish, whose family name is sometimes spelled Arbaysh in English, soon emerged as a regular spokesman for the Qaeda branch. In 2009, when the group sent a suicide bomber to Saudi Arabia in an unsuccessful attempt to kill that country's counterterrorism chief, Mr. Rubeish offered the justification in an audio message.After Mr. Awlaki was killed in a drone strike in September 2011, Mr. Rubeish who took the central role in the group's elaborate video remembrance. Last year, he denounced the American airstrikes against the so-called Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, saying the decision not to send ground troops ""is due to the bitterness of what they tasted in their past experience in Iraq and Afghanistan.""In January, after gunmen attacked the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, Mr. Rubeish praised the killings and called for more attacks in France and elsewhere in the West. The State Department had labeled him a ""specially designated global terrorist,"" and the government was offering a reward of up to $5 million for information about his location.",1.0
"U.S. Soldiers, Back in Iraq, Find Security Forces in Disrepair:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"CAMP TAJI, Iraq -- Lt. Col. John Schwemmer is here for his sixth Iraq deployment. Maj. James Modlin is on his fourth. Sgt. Maj. Thomas Foos? ""It's so many, I would rather not say. Sir.""These soldiers are among 300 from the 5-73 Squadron of the 82nd Airborne Division of the United States Army, about half of them trainers, the rest support and force protection. Stationed at this old Iraqi military base 20 miles north of Baghdad, they are as close as it gets to American boots on the ground in Iraq.Back now for the first time since the United States left in 2011, none of them thought they would be here again, let alone return to find the Iraqi Army they had once trained in such disrepair.Colonel Schwemmer said he was stunned at the state in which he found the Iraqi soldiers when he arrived here. ""It's pretty incredible,"" he said. ""I was kind of surprised. What training did they have after we left?""Apparently, not much. The current, woeful state of the Iraqi military raises the question not so much of whether the Americans left too soon, but whether a new round of deployments for training will have any more effect than the last.Iraq's army looked good on paper when the Americans left, after one of the biggest training missions carried out under wartime conditions. But after that, senior Iraqi officers began buying their own commissions, paying for them out of the supply, food and payroll money of their troops. Corruption ran up and down the ranks; desertion was rife.The army did little more than staff checkpoints. Then, last year, four divisions collapsed overnight in Mosul and elsewhere in northern Iraq under the determined assault of Islamic State fighters numbering in the hundreds or at most the low thousands, and the extremists' advance came as far as this base.An army that once counted 280,000 active-duty personnel, one of the largest in the world, is now believed by some experts to have as few as four to seven fully active divisions -- as little as 50,000 troops by some estimates. The director of media operations for Iraq's Ministry of Defense, Qais al-Rubaiae, said, however, that even by the most conservative estimates, the army now had at least 141,000 soldiers in 15 divisions.Most of the American soldiers were intimately involved in training Iraqi forces before, too. ""When I left in 2009,"" Major Modlin said, ""they had it, they really did. I don't know what happened after that.""""We used to say that every deployment was different,"" Major Modlin said. ""But we quickly found out that this time was completely different from any other time. The Iraqis know that this time we're not going to do it for them, and they appreciate that.""The 300 American soldiers here, with a smaller number of United States Marines at Al Asad air base in Anbar Province, are the only American soldiers deployed outside Baghdad. But as the military sees it, they do not count as ""boots on the ground"" since their role is purely to train, advise and assist, as part of a 3,000-person deployment authorized in November by President Obama.In fact, Master Sgt. Mike Lavigne, a military spokesman (one tour in Iraq and three in Afghanistan), does not like that term at all. ""We do not have a single boot on the ground,"" he said. ""Really, not one.""Even in a training role, however, this venerable Iraqi military base puts American soldiers very close to what passes for a front line in the conflict with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. From time to time, the extremists lob mortar rounds from their hiding places east of the base, just across the Tigris River.There is little chance they will hit anything. The base is huge, and their aim is as bad as it was in Al Qaeda's day, when the Americans were last here -- and used it as a major training base. Nonetheless, no one goes around without body armor on.On Thursday, the American instructors were leading a live-fire exercise, teaching basic small-unit maneuvering while firing at pop-up targets. Squad-size groups of Iraqi soldiers charged through a scrub-brush field, so realistic fires popped up around them.""Small-unit maneuvering is pretty standard the world over,"" Command Sgt. Maj. Michael Ames said. As basic as the training was, many of the trainees -- even those in the army already more than a year -- had never experienced it.It was a striking departure from the last years of the Iraq war, when American and Iraqi soldiers were carefully separated at training facilities. Live ammunition was rarely used when they were together in the latter years of the American presence, for fear of so-called insider attacks, in which soldiers assault their Western allies.""You have to have a level of trust, and we're with them here,"" Colonel Schwemmer said. ""It's the common enemy that ties us together.""Sgt. Ali Mesin Hamid, the squad leader, was clearly appreciative. ""We've never had training this good,"" he said after his men went through the exercise, exulting at having hit all the targets. ""We'll be ready for the real fight.""Their American drill instructor, Sgt. First Class James Grimes (four deployments to Iraq), had a more nuanced view, as he showed the soldiers a sandbox representing the field they had just been on. Bottle caps stood for each fighter and piles of sand for their firing positions.""You guys saw how quick you ran out of ammo, right?"" he said. And they needed to concentrate more on making sure their fields of fire overlapped, covering a broader area than just the targets they could see. ""Other than that, pretty good.""Those soldiers were already in their fifth week of a six-week basic training course; some will come back for an additional three weeks. In all, 3,600 from two Iraqi brigades are in the American training program, and 4,600 more have graduated since the program began late last year.With the Taji training site running at maximum capacity, as it is now, that means the program will reach at most about 30,000 Iraqi soldiers by the end of this year, probably far fewer. The Marines at Al Asad train smaller numbers of regular soldiers.""They're going to leave here trained,"" Colonel Schwemmer said. ""But there's a big difference between trained and seasoned.""Whether those who are trained go straight into the fight against the Islamic State is not a decision the Americans will be part of. That, they say, is entirely an Iraqi government decision. Given the shortages of troops in the fight against the Islamic State, deployment on the front lines seems pretty likely.Many of the trainees were relatively new recruits, who had joined straight after the collapse of the military in the face of the Islamic State's onslaught in June. Some had originally joined the popular Shiite militias, which are credited with halting the extremists' advance after the military fell apart.But they are also blamed for human rights abuses and the deepening rift between Sunnis and Shiites, which the Sunni-based insurgency has exploited.Ahmed Abud Hassan, 21, joined after his cousin at Camp Speicher was presumably killed among the 1,700 prisoners executed there by the Islamic State. Sajad Hakim, 21, had a brother in Mosul in the military who was never seen again.The two men, Shiites from Diwaniya, said they eventually chose the military over the militias; for one thing, it offered better pay and a pension.""We're not going to stop,"" Mr. Hassan said. ""We're going to keep fighting in their honor.""Their Iraqi regimental commander, Maj. Masar Hasim (six deployments with American soldiers, and three other wars), was a veteran of a half-dozen battlefields against the Islamic State in the past year, but he said this was the first time his men had received any meaningful training.""This is a completely different level of training, nothing like what we had before,"" he said. But the Iraqi major was cleareyed about their ability and thought it would be a long time before they made a difference in the field.""If I get 100 good soldiers out of this 400 we have here, I would feel like a king,"" he said.Photograph Iraqi Army Recruits Training in Taji, Iraq, On Sunday.

Drone Strikes Said to Set a Dangerous Precedent:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- An investigation of American drone strikes in Yemen concludes that the Obama administration has not followed its own rules to avoid civilian casualties and is setting a dangerous example for other countries that want to use unmanned aircraft against terrorists.The study, by the Open Society Justice Initiative, a legal advocacy group based in New York, was released on Monday at a time when Yemen has been engulfed in violence and American drone strikes have been slowed or halted. But its observations about the performance of American counterterrorism strikes from 2012 to 2014 remain relevant for assessing a novel weapons system that the United States has used in several countries and has now approved for export to a limited number of allies.Despite promises of greater openness about drone strikes, the Obama administration has continued to guard their secrecy closely and says nothing publicly about strike targets and results. The resulting information vacuum has been partly filled by independent studies by groups like the Open Society Justice Initiative, which worked with the Mwatana Organization for Human Rights, a Yemeni group that interviewed witnesses.In May 2013, in a long-planned speech on the targeted killing of terrorists, President Obama described a rigorous standard that he said guided all drone strikes. ""Before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured -- the highest standard we can set,"" he said.Mr. Obama said that some civilian casualties were unavoidable, adding, ""For me, and those in my chain of command, those deaths will haunt us as long as we live.""But the new report questions how careful the strikes have been, based on the analysis of nine strikes in Yemen, where strikes are carried out by both the C.I.A. and the military's Joint Special Operations Command. Each of those strikes killed civilians, the study found, with a total of 26 civilians killed, including five children, and 13 others injured.""We've found evidence that President Obama's standard is not being met on the ground,"" said Amrit Singh, a senior legal officer at the Open Society Justice Initiative and a primary author of the report. ""There's a real question about whether the near-certainty standard is being applied in practice.""Asked about the report's findings, a National Security Council spokesman, Ned Price, said that he was ""not in a position to comment on specific cases"" because of secrecy rules, but that the standard Mr. Obama described in 2013 was still in place.""In those rare instances in which it appears noncombatants may have been killed or injured, after-action reviews have been conducted to determine why,"" he said, adding that condolence payments were sometimes given to those injured and families of those killed.Mr. Price said administration officials ""continue to work diligently toward"" the goal of greater transparency. The military announced strikes against Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria, as well as recent strikes in Somalia, but no information has been released on strikes in Pakistan or Yemen.The Open Society report also questions whether the administration is acting on its stated policy of always capturing terrorists when ""feasible"" rather than killing them. In two of the strikes it studied, the researchers quoted witnesses as saying the targeted individuals, who had been identified by American intelligence as members of Al Qaeda, could easily have been arrested by the Yemeni authorities.An American official, speaking about the classified operations on the condition of anonymity, said that in some cases a foreign government ""only has the most tenuous reach into parts of its territory"" and that capture operations ""would pose profound risks to our forces."" But the official noted that foreign partners often capture and imprison terrorism suspects based on American intelligence.Drones loaded with Hellfire missiles and other munitions were first used by the United States in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and became an integral part of the American wars there and in Iraq. There were sporadic strikes against militants in Pakistan until mid-2008, when President George W. Bush sharply escalated the drone campaign there.Mr. Obama stepped up strikes in Pakistan further and expanded them to Yemen and Somalia early in his presidency. The pace of strikes has slowed, however, and is well below the peak in 2010 in Pakistan and 2012 in Yemen.Advocates of drone strikes argue that they are particularly suited for pursuing small groups of terrorists and that they kill far fewer civilians than conventional airstrikes or ground troops. American officials often assert that accounts of civilian deaths by independent groups are exaggerated, but they rarely give their own account of who was killed.""This program has no public disclosure about who's being killed and why, and there's no public accountability,"" Ms. Singh, the report's author, said. ""If you insulate a program with secrecy, you prevent information that could correct it from coming to light.""In the most recent strike analyzed by the Open Society report, in April 2014, two drones fired on a Toyota Land Cruiser outside the town of Bayda. The report concludes that the men in the Land Cruiser, all of whom were killed, were indeed Qaeda fighters.But shrapnel from the strike hit 12 laborers in a Toyota Hilux just ahead of the Land Cruiser. Four of them were killed and five more injured, the report found, based on interviews with survivors. Based on negotiations between tribal leaders and the Yemeni government, the government paid about $55,000 in compensation and 30 Kalashnikov rifles, costs that Yemeni officials have said are generally covered by the United States.Another strike in the same province in September 2012, the report found, killed 12 people and injured two others as they rode a truck home after selling their wares in a town market. The victims included a pregnant woman and her 10-year-old daughter, as well as 15- and 17-year-old boys. The researchers found no evidence of Qaeda connections among those killed. Local news reports said the intended target was a local Qaeda leader who was not present.Again, the government compensated the affected families with cash and weapons. But the fear of strikes from the drones that regularly patrolled the skies lingered. ""We live in constant fear,"" the report quoted an anonymous survivor as saying. ""There is no assurance that we would not be the next targets."" The brother of one of those killed was quoted as declaring, ""The U.S. government should come to the region to see what targets it has hit.""Ms. Singh said, ""The voices of these individuals have not been heard by the U.S. government, because no one is going over to Yemen and asking what happened.""The C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan, said at his confirmation hearing in 2013 that he believed that the United States should publicly acknowledge unintended civilian deaths in counterterrorism strikes. But it has never happened.For years, arms experts have been concerned about the example set by the United States for other countries as armed drones proliferate. Drones have been used to fire missiles by Israel and Britain as well as by the United States, but many other countries are seeking to develop or buy them.In February, in response to pressure from arms manufacturers and many countries, the Obama administration announced rules governing the export of armed drones. A State Department fact sheet said the rules required ""all sales and transfers to include agreement to principles for proper use.""Photograph A Building in the Yemeni Province of Shabwah That Was Destroyed by an American Drone Strike Targeting Qaeda Forces.

Philippines Issues a Protest Over China's Island-Building:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MANILA -- China's island-building activities have destroyed about 300 acres of coral reefs and are causing ""irreversible and widespread damage to the biodiversity and ecological balance"" of the South China Sea, a spokesman for the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said on Monday.""China has pursued these activities unilaterally, disregarding people in the surrounding states who have depended on the sea for their livelihood for generations,"" the spokesman, Charles Jose, said during a news briefing in Manila.He said China's neighbors in the South China Sea could lose up to $100 million a year because of the loss of the coral reefs, which are breeding grounds for high-value fish harvested by countries surrounding the sea.China has been undertaking land reclamation projects on the sand spits, islets and submerged reefs of the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, according to satellite images released in the last year. United States and Philippine officials have said the newly constructed islands could serve as military outposts in the area, parts of which are also claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam and other governments.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said last week that the construction was focused on building maritime aids for China, its neighbors and international vessels in the South China Sea. The islands will host ""typhoon shelters, navigation aids, search-and-rescue centers, marine meteorological forecasting stations, fishing services and civil administration offices,"" she said.United States military officials have used strong language in the past month to protest China's island-building activities, noting that the construction work is decreasing the chances of a diplomatic resolution to the territorial disputes in the South China Sea.Last week, the Philippines and the United States announced that their annual joint military exercises would be the largest conducted in 15 years and would include war games in coastal areas facing the South China Sea. The exercises, which are to begin next Monday, include more than 11,000 soldiers and sailors from both countries. That is twice the number of troops involved in last year's exercises, officials said.The joint operations will be conducted throughout the country, including on the west coast of Luzon Island and in the western coastal areas of the province of Palawan, both of which face the South China Sea. Some of the military drills will be held at the former United States naval base in San Miguel in the province of Zambales, which is less than 150 miles from Scarborough Shoal, a Chinese-controlled reef that is also claimed by the Philippines.Philippine military officials said last week that the expansion of the war games was not intended to send a message to China. A Philippine military spokesman, Lt. Col. Harold Cabunoc, said the activities, called Balikatan, were part of regular annual exercises and would be focused primarily on disaster response.""The higher strength of Balikatan 2015 for this year only reflects the Philippines' and the United States' growing commitment to enhance our capability to conduct joint military and nonmilitary activities,"" he said.The Philippines filed a case in March last year with an international tribunal based in the Netherlands seeking to clarify the conflicting claims in the South China Sea. The Philippine foreign secretary, Albert del Rosario, has said a decision from the tribunal could come by the first quarter of 2016. China has declined to participate in the proceedings, saying the areas in question are sovereign territory not under the jurisdiction of an international tribunal.",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; China: U.S. Blamed for Regional Rifts:   [Foreign Desk ],,"HONG KONG -- A top Chinese official said Thursday that American military drills and surveillance flights in the South China Sea were threatening regional stability, a harsh assessment that seemed likely to heighten tensions between the two countries before several crucial meetings.The official, Col. Yang Yujun, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, said it was the United States, not China, that was to blame for rising tensions in the resource-rich South China Sea, where China and several other countries are engaged in territorial disputes.""The Chinese side expresses its deep concern about the United States pushing the militarization,"" Colonel Yang said at a news conference in Beijing. ""The behavior by the United States can only lead one to suspect whether the American side is driven by a desire to see the world in turmoil.""The dispute over the South China Sea, one of the world's busiest trade routes, has emerged as a serious point of contention between China and the United States.It is likely to be high on the agenda when President Xi Jinping visits the United States to meet with President Obama in September, and when Secretary of State John Kerry goes to Malaysia next week for a meeting of Asian nations.China has argued that it is entitled to 90 percent of the sea, putting it at odds with several nearby countries, including the Philippines and Vietnam. In recent months, it has accelerated its efforts to build artificial islands hundreds of miles off its shore, capable of holding runways, radar and missile systems. China maintains that the islands will primarily be used for rescue operations and scientific research.While the United States has not taken a formal position on the territorial disputes, it has called on China to resolve the disagreements in international courts, an idea that Beijing has resisted. American officials have also worked to deepen military ties in the region, for example, by participating in joint military exercises with the Philippines, as well as air and sea surveillance operations.In his remarks on Thursday, Colonel Yang took aim at those efforts, pointing to a recent seven-hour surveillance flight over the South China Sea by the commander of the United States Pacific Fleet, Adm. Scott H. Swift. Colonel Yang warned that the United States should maintain a ""safe distance to avoid unexpected incidents.""In an aside, he added, ""If there are American people willing to board civilian vessels to enjoy the beautiful scenery of China's South China Sea, we can express our welcome.""Colonel Yang also criticized recent comments by Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., commander of the United States Pacific Command. At a panel discussion in Colorado this month, Admiral Harris accused China of pursuing military objectives in the South China Sea and causing damage to the ocean environment.The Defense Department took issue with Mr. Yang, arguing that the United States had contributed to economic prosperity in the region.""We have helped to sustain a rules-based maritime regime that safeguards for all nations the freedoms of navigation and overflight and other related lawful uses of the sea,"" Cmdr. William Urban, a spokesman for the Defense Department, said in a statement.Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the Chinese seemed eager to gain the upper hand in the debate by criticizing the United States in the same manner that Americans had criticized China recently.""The region is on edge,"" Ms. Glaser said. ""China is under a microscope, and I don't think the Chinese really have an effective strategy for reassuring the region.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
Turkey Aims Its Airstrikes at the Kurds:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Turkey stepped up its offensive against Kurdish militias in northern Iraq early Wednesday, pounding targets in six locations from the air, officials said.The Iraqi government condemned the airstrikes, calling them ""a dangerous escalation and an assault on Iraqi sovereignty.""Turkish officials said the airstrikes were carried out in response to a string of terrorist attacks in Turkey by militants of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K., a separatist group that waged a 30-year insurgency against Turkish rule. The office of Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in a written statement that the strikes on Wednesday were against shelters, depots and caves used as hide-outs by the group. No information was released concerning casualties.The P.K.K. reached a cease-fire agreement with the Turkish government two years ago, but that tenuous peace has fallen apart in recent weeks. The government says that the group has refused to disarm and that it has carried out a series of attacks since the parliamentary elections on June 7, when Kurdish candidates made a strong showing.On Tuesday, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey, said it was impossible to continue a peace process with the militants while they threatened national unity and brotherhood. He called on Parliament to deny immunity from prosecution to any lawmakers linked to terrorist groups, a remark seen as a threat to Kurdish lawmakers.Turkey agreed last week to take a more active role in the American-led coalition's fight against the Islamic State, the Sunni Arab militant group that has seized large areas of Syria and Iraq. But Turkey's air campaign since then has mainly been directed at the P.K.K., and the bombing raids it began on Friday effectively ended the cease-fire.The possibility of retaliatory attacks by the P.K.K. prompted a warning from the German Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, saying that the underground rail network and bus stops in Istanbul could be targets, Reuters reported.Mr. Davutoglu said Turkey would keep bombing the Kurdish militants as long as the militants threatened violence. ""If we have one martyr, we will continue all operations on that organization that ordered the attack,"" Mr. Davutoglu told members of his governing party in a speech on Wednesday.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"World Briefing | Europe; Sweden: Russian Sub Spotted, 99 Years After It Sank:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"LONDON -- The mystery vessel was found off the Swedish coast last week lying on the sea floor, its hatches closed. Cyrillic letters on the hull suggested it was Russian.In Sweden, where memories of the Cold War run deep, speculation swirled about whether the unidentified craft was a Russian submarine that had sunk while on a secret mission. Its age was not immediately obvious, and the Swedish authorities were unsure how long it had lain there, submerged and undetected.This week, the Swedish authorities said they had solved the mystery: The vessel was an imperial submarine -- nicknamed a Catfish -- that had probably sunk after colliding with a Swedish vessel in 1916, during World War I.The Swedish news media reported that the submarine had been part of the Imperial Russian Navy and that it had sunk with its crew of 18 in May 1916.""We have seen the wreck and we can confirm that the vessel is from the czarist era and that it is a submarine that collided with another ship,"" Lubna El-Shanti, a spokeswoman for the Swedish Armed Forces, said on Wednesday by telephone from Stockholm. ""It is a very old vessel. It is from before the time of the Soviet Union.""The discovery of the vessel comes at a time of tense East-West relations, with anxiety in the region fanned by Russia's annexation of Crimea and by the conflict in Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian rebels.In October, the sighting of a mysterious vessel off the Stockholm archipelago led Sweden to undertake its largest mobilization since the end of the Cold War. The discovery, including unsubstantiated reports of a man in black wading near the craft, prompted speculation that a Russian spy had been sent to infiltrate the country. A month later, Swedish officials confirmed that its territorial waters had been violated by a foreign submarine. The Kremlin insisted that the vessel did not belong to Russia.Referring to the latest discovery, Ms. Shanti stressed that while Sweden was always on the lookout for foreign vessels entering its waters without permission, the imperial submarine was a remnant of the past and had no relation to contemporary geopolitics.""This event has nothing to do with Russian aggression,"" she said.The submarine was discovered by a Swedish company called Ocean X Team, which hunts for lost treasure and shipwrecks. Ms. Shanti said the vessel had been identified by comparing photographs and footage of the wreck provided by Ocean X Team with archival photographs of Russian submarines.Submarines have a history of grabbing attention in Sweden. In 1981, when a Soviet submarine thought to have been carrying nuclear weapons hit an underwater rock off the Swedish coast near Karlskrona, Moscow and Stockholm engaged in a tense standoff for a week. During the episode, which was nicknamed ""Whisky on the Rocks,"" the Swedish authorities questioned the vessel's Soviet captain on a Swedish torpedo board, while the submarine was towed off the rock.The alarm over Russian submarines in Sweden has veered into popular culture and even farce. The Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, a leading antiwar organization, has installed what it calls the Singing Sailor Underwater Defense System, also known as the Gay Sailor, in the Baltic Sea off Stockholm.The unusual ""subsurface sonar system"" is a box with a neon sign of a gyrating sailor in white underwear and a cap. The group submerged the box, which sends out the message, ""This way if you are gay"" in Morse code through the water in what the group said was meant as an impudent deterrent to the Russian military. Another message, ""Welcome to Sweden. Gay since 1944,"" referring to the year Sweden legalized homosexuality, is written on the device.Andreas Ribbefjord, vice president of the peace group, said the system was both a commentary on homophobia in Russia and a revolt against calls for more spending on defense in Sweden.""We have had this fear of Russian submarines for months, and we wanted to counter this fearmongering,"" he said.

"China's Naval Buildup Starts to Yield Results, U.S. Report Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SINGAPORE -- China is rapidly building coast guard ships, the vessels that China most commonly uses for patrols in the South China Sea, and in the last three years has increased the number of ships in that category 25 percent, a new report by the United States Navy says.China has the world's largest coast guard fleet, with more such ships than its neighbors Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines combined, the report shows.The unclassified assessment of the Chinese Navy, the first in nine years by the United States Navy's Office of Naval Intelligence, says the rapid modernization over the last 15 years is yielding dramatic results.The Chinese Navy is ""on track to dramatically increase its combat capability by 2020 through rapid acquisition and improved operational proficiency,"" the report says.In 2014, China began construction on, launched or commissioned more than 60 vessels, and a similar number of ships were planned in 2015, it said, adding: ""In 2013 and 2014, China launched more naval ships than any other country and is expected to continue this trend through 2015-16.""The United States Navy faces growing competition from China in the Pacific Ocean, and Washington has become increasingly concerned about China's maritime power as it undertakes reclamation works to create artificial islands in contested areas of the South China Sea.The new islands were to serve a variety of purposes, among them the establishment of defensive military capabilities in the waterway, one of the busiest trade routes in the world, China's Foreign Ministry said Thursday.The Navy report noted that despite its slowing economy, China had continued its double-digit increases in military spending, announcing in March a military budget of $141.5 billion, an increase of 10 percent.In keeping with President Xi Jinping's goal to make China a great maritime power, China will have a much more robust navy with far greater reach in the coming decade with multiple aircraft carriers (China has only one so far), ballistic missile submarines and, potentially, a large-deck amphibious ship. At the moment, the report says, the Chinese Navy is built around destroyers, frigates and conventional submarines.The report confirms recent announcements in the Chinese state-run news media that China has deployed the YJ-18, a new generation supersonic antiship cruise missile that could present unprecedented challenges to the air defenses of American and allied ships, said Andrew S. Erickson, an associate professor at the United States Naval War College in Rhode Island.""Everyone serious about understanding Chinese military capabilities must familiarize themselves with this missile,"" Mr. Erickson said.An article in China Daily said last week that three ""cutting-edge nuclear-powered attack submarines"" had been manufactured by China and that one of them, referred to as the Type-093G, had a wing-shaped cross section designed to improve speed and mobility and to reduce noise. That submarine carried a vertical launcher capable of delivering China's latest YJ-18 supersonic antiship cruise missile, the article said.In the past, China had received antiship cruise missiles from Russia, but now China is making them at home and fielding them in greater numbers, said Lyle J. Goldstein, an associate professor in the China Maritime Studies Institute at the United States Naval War College.""This missile, and its air-launched cousin, the YJ-12, are major threats to the U.S. Navy,"" Mr. Goldstein said.

Tensions Between Iran and Saudi Arabia Deepen Over Conflict in Yemen:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia deepened on Thursday as Iranian leaders lashed out with rare vehemence against the continuing Saudi air campaign in Yemen, even hurling personal insults at the young Saudi prince who is leading the fight.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, on Thursday denounced the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen as ""a crime"" and ""a genocide,"" while all but taunting Saudi Arabia that its war in Yemen was doomed to fail.A regional coalition led by Saudi Arabia extended its bombing campaign for a 16th night in its effort to stop the Houthi movement and its allies from dominating Yemen. The Houthis nonetheless continued their advance, and aid groups warned of a compounding humanitarian catastrophe, particularly in the port city of Aden.Secretary of State John Kerry sharply warned Iran over its backing for the other side of the conflict in Yemen, in the first explicit American accusation that Tehran has been providing military aid to the Houthis.Washington was ""not going to stand by while the region is destabilized,"" Mr. Kerry said in an interview with ""PBS NewsHour"" on Wednesday night.""There are obviously supplies that have been coming from Iran,"" he added. ""There are a number of flights every single week that have been flying in. We trace those flights, and we know this. We are well aware of the support that Iran has been giving to Yemen.""The United States has recently increased the provision of logistical support, intelligence and weapons to the Saudi campaign, just days after the announcement of a framework for a nuclear deal with Iran. Mr. Kerry said he was seeking to reassure allies, including Saudi Arabia, that the United States could ""do two things at the same time."" The United States could help push back against Iranian attempts to project its influence around the region, he argued, while at the same time negotiating a deal that would reward Tehran for providing guarantees that it was not building nuclear weapons.Saudi Arabia has said it is bombing the Houthis because it sees them as an instrument of Iranian power, but Western diplomats and independent experts have said that while Iran has supported the Houthis financially, it has no direct control over the group.The back-and-forth insults and threats Thursday raised fears that the Yemeni conflict could further inflame the rivalry between the two regional heavyweights, Iran and Saudi Arabia, already fighting each other through sectarian proxies in Syria and in less overt struggles across Iraq, Lebanon and Bahrain.Some analysts suggested that the battle for Yemen may further complicate the delicate politics of a deal with the Western powers to restrain Iran's nuclear program. But others argued that the deal had instead emboldened Iran to flex its muscles against Saudi Arabia.""Deep down, the Iranians know that they are winning,"" said Michael Stephens, the head of the Royal United Services Institute in Doha, Qatar.Mr. Kerry appeared forced into a difficult balance, reassuring Saudi Arabia and other allies of American support against Iran without antagonizing Iranian hard-liners severely enough to fuel opposition to the nuclear deal.The Ayatollah's diatribe only added to the challenge.In rare direct criticism of Iran's rival by name, Ayatollah Khamenei said that Saudi Arabia was departing from a history of acting with dignity in foreign affairs, saying that ""inexperienced youths have taken over the affairs of the state and are replacing dignity with barbarity.""His comments were a jab at the Saudi defense minister, Prince Mohamed bin Salman, who Saudi diplomats say is about 30. He is also a son of King Salman, who ascended to the throne this year and promptly named him to the powerful dual roles of defense minister and chief of the royal court.The Saudi news media has been cheering Prince Mohamed as the architect and overseer of the Yemeni campaign despite a light résumé, raising eyebrows among rivals in the royal family and setting him up for embarrassment if it is deemed to have failed.In a statement on Thursday, Ayatollah Khamenei warned the Saudis ""they must cease their crimes in Yemen,"" and that failure there was all but inevitable.""They will be harmed and incur losses in this issue in which they will under no circumstances triumph. The Saudis' face will be rubbed in the ground in Yemen,"" he said, comparing the Saudi actions to Israel's campaigns against Palestinian militants in Gaza -- who have also received support from Iran.In another statement, released over Twitter along with some of his other remarks, the ayatollah further teased Saudi Arabia about its pledge to catch up to Iran in the development of a nuclear weapon.""An underdeveloped country said that 'If Iran has enrichment, we want it too,' "" he said. ""Well, do it if you can. Nuclear technology is our domestic capability.""Mr. Stephens, of the Royal Unity Services Institute, said the extraordinary barbed comments appeared designed to provoke and inflame.""It is almost like the Iranians are baiting the Saudis, trying to find every pressure point, to make the Saudis feel emasculated, and then stand back and watch as the Saudis get in deeper and deeper,"" he said.But at the same time, he argued, the Iranians were sending a message of support to their Yemeni allies, the Houthis.""They have decided to show that they are willing to stand behind the Houthis,"" Mr. Stephens said. ""The Iranians are making some sort of a guarantee to their allies that, whatever happens, they are going to make sure that the Houthis are at the table for the talks.""Saudi Arabia, which is leading a regional coalition against the Houthis, issued its own warning to Iran, saying that two Iranian warships that recently arrived in the waters off Yemen should steer clear of Yemeni waters. ""If the ships seek to aid the Houthis, the coalition has the right to choose the proper answer,"" said a spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ahmad Asseri.In another provocation, Saudi Arabia denied permission for an Iranian plane filled with pilgrims to land in Mecca.The Houthis, a group based in northern Yemen that follows a strain of Shiite Islam, have fought a half dozen conflicts with the Yemeni government since 2004, including a fight in 2009 that drew Saudi Arabia into border skirmishes. Only since that time, scholars say, has the movement received support from Iran, the region's main Shiite Muslim power as well as Saudi Arabia's rival.Since the fall, however, the Houthis have teamed with major units of the Yemeni security forces still loyal to the former strongman, Ali Abdullah Saleh. Those units have helped the Houthi-allied forces capture the capital, Sana, and much of Yemen.Their advance appears to have continued despite the two-week-old Saudi bombing campaign. On Thursday, Al Jazeera television network -- owned by Qatar, part of the Saudi coalition -- said the Houthi-allied forces had also occupied Ataq, capital of Shabwa Province, taking control of government offices.At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose efforts to restart a political dialogue in Yemen have collapsed, implored the Houthis to halt their expansion. But he also has been critical of the Saudi-led military campaign.""The coalition air raids -- and the continuing attempts by the Houthis and their allied armed groups to expand their power -- have turned an internal political crisis into a violent conflict that risks deep and long-lasting regional repercussions,"" Mr. Ban said at United Nations headquarters.""The last thing the region and our world need is more of the chaos and crimes we have seen in Libya and Syria,"" he said.",1.0
North Korea Fires Missiles Before U.S. Official's Trip:   [Foreign Desk ],,"OSAN AIR BASE, South Korea -- Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter's welcome present was waiting for him when he touched down here on Thursday: confirmed reports that North Korea fired two short-range missiles off its western coast two days before his first visit to South Korea as President Obama's defense chief.South Korean officials informed their American counterparts that the North on Tuesday fired two surface-to-air missiles from Pyongwon County in South Pyongan Province. The missiles flew only a few miles before plunging into the sea, defense officials said.Mr. Carter, who arrived here for talks with his South Korean counterparts over security measures on the Korean Peninsula, said the missile launch demonstrated how tense the region remained.""If it was a welcome message to me, I'm flattered,"" he told reporters in Japan before boarding his flight to South Korea.A senior defense official, speaking to reporters aboard Mr. Carter's plane, called the North Korean action ""provocative."" He said that ""you'll have to ask the North Koreans"" why they conducted the missile test so close to the arrival of the American defense secretary in South Korea, but he added that ""these are the kinds of provocative acts that the alliance is designed to respond to,"" referring to the military alliance between the United States and South Korea.The official said the Pentagon believed that the North Korean nuclear threat was growing.North Korea is officially banned from conducting ballistic missile tests by United Nations resolutions but routinely does so anyway, often to express anger. The North fired a series of short-range missiles into the sea last week to register its dislike of annual United States-South Korea military drills. The North also flouted United Nations resolutions the month before by launching two Scud-type ballistic missiles offshore, as the United States and South Korea began their annual joint military drills. At the time, the North Korean military issued a statement warning that it would ""never remain a passive onlooker"" to the annual joint war games, called Key Resolve and Foal Eagle.The exercises involve tens of thousands of South Korean and American troops.Tensions between the United States and North Korea have been even higher than usual since a cyberattack on Sony Pictures late last year. The United States has blamed North Korea for that attack.President Obama warned in January that a government like North Korea's would collapse over time, saying that the democratic influences of the Internet would eventually penetrate that country.Although both Washington and Seoul say their annual military exercises are defensive, Pyongyang often reacts harshly and stages its own maneuvers.In March 2010, a South Korean warship exploded in waters near the border with North Korea, killing 46 sailors, and Seoul attributed it to a North Korean torpedo attack.On Friday, Mr. Carter is scheduled to visit a memorial to those sailors.",1.0
Houthi Leader Is Defiant in Face of Saudi Airstrikes:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- More than three weeks after Saudi Arabia began a bombing campaign aimed at crippling his movement, the leader of Yemen's Houthi rebels responded with defiance on Sunday in a televised speech, saying that Saudi attempts to ""humiliate"" his country were doomed.""Those who want the people to give in are just dreaming,"" the leader, Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, said in a long, fuming address that was also sharply critical of the United States. ""Our Yemeni people have the right to fend off the aggression, and to confront the aggressor with all possible and available means,"" he said on a Houthi news channel.Mr. Houthi gave no indication that he was willing to negotiate with the Saudis or to agree to their conditions for a cease-fire, including that the Houthis withdraw from cities they have captured. His defiance suggested a prolonged war and raised further questions about the Saudi government's military strategy, which has been centered on pounding the Houthis and their allies from the air.The Saudis launched the intervention with backing from the United States and a coalition of Arab states, aiming to restore Yemen's exiled government, led by President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The coalition's warplanes have carried out hundreds of airstrikes, targeting military bases and positions held by the Houthis and their main allies, military units and security forces loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh, who ceded the presidency in 2012.The intensity of the Saudi bombing has left Yemen facing the likelihood of a devastated military, even when this conflict ends. The airstrikes have also hit factories and homes, killing dozens of civilians and arousing misgivings even among Saudi allies.Residents in Sana, the capital, have been subjected to daily airstrikes for weeks. And in the southern port city of Aden, hundreds of people have been killed in street fighting between the Houthis and Mr. Saleh's forces on one side, and local militias representing Yemen's southern separatists on the other.In the latest sign the war is spreading, dozens of people have been killed in recent days in Taiz, Yemen's third largest city, where fighters loyal to Mr. Hadi, backed by Saudi airstrikes, are battling the Houthis and their allies.Several military units have switched sides by declaring their loyalty to the exiled president, Mr. Hadi. On Sunday, Yemeni officials told the Reuters news agency that a brigadier general who commands a district along the Saudi border and leads 15,000 troops had also pledged his support for Mr. Hadi.It remained to be seen whether the defections would tip the balance in the conflict or simply further fracture the country. A multiplying cast of combatants are being drawn into the fight -- including military units with shifting loyalties, armed tribesmen, separatist fighters and extremist militants with Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch -- and are confusing the battle lines.",1.0
World Briefing | Europe; Ukraine: Kremlin Issues Warning as U.S. Military Trainers Arrive:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- The Kremlin on Friday warned that the arrival of several hundred American military trainers in Ukraine could ""destabilize the situation"" in the country's southeast, where a cease-fire between government troops and Russian-backed separatists is barely holding.On Friday, the United States Army announced that about 300 troops from the 173rd Airborne Brigade, based in Italy, had arrived in western Ukraine this week for Operation Fearless Guardian, a six-month training rotation for three battalions of Ukraine's National Guard engaged in combat duty. It is the first training mission by American troops in Ukraine since the war in the southeast began.The training program is modest assistance to Ukraine's war effort, falling short of the lethal aid, like sophisticated antitank weapons, that Ukrainian politicians and soldiers on the front lines have requested from the United States. Last month, the Obama administration announced that it would give an additional $75 million in aid to Ukraine's military, but that did not include the weapons that many administration officials and Democratic and Republican members of Congress have urged President Obama to provide.In remarks on Thursday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said that any Ukrainian offensive would be unsuccessful. On Friday, Dmitry S. Peskov, Mr. Putin's press secretary, delivered a sharp warning in response to the arrival of the military trainers.""The participation of instructors or specialists from third countries on Ukrainian territory, where the domestic Ukrainian conflict is unresolved, could destabilize the situation,"" Mr. Peskov told reporters.The Kremlin's warning came despite a large body of evidence, including the unexplained deaths of more than a dozen Russian servicemen in eastern Ukraine, that Russian soldiers and advanced weaponry were already there. Asked on Thursday to comment on the extent of Russian support for the separatists, Mr. Putin said there were no Russian soldiers in eastern Ukraine and moved on to other topics.The White House rebuffed a request for weapons from President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine in September, announcing an additional $53 million nonlethal aid program instead. Mr. Obama has signaled privately that he is reluctant to arm Ukraine despite increasing pressure from both parties in Congress.Russian officials regularly blame the West for provoking the conflict in Ukraine, and in February, Mr. Putin said he had proof that the West was already providing weapons to Kiev. State and pro-Kremlin news networks have broadcast many lurid and dubious accounts of Western interference, including breathless stories of dark-skinned and English-speaking paramilitaries terrorizing local residents in eastern Ukraine.In a statement, Maj. Jose Mendez, an operations officer for the 173rd Airborne, said the training would focus on ""on war fighting functions, as well as training to sustain and increase the professionalism and proficiency of military staffs.""Several dozen British soldiers began conducting military training last month, and Canada and Poland have pledged to send military trainers this year.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
American Naval Force Off Yemen Gets Credit After Iranian Convoy Turns Away:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Pentagon officials on Friday credited the deployment of an American aircraft carrier group in waters off the coast of Yemen for a decision by Iran to turn back a naval convoy suspected of carrying weapons bound for Shiite rebels.Although it was unusual to dispatch such a large American naval force to the Arabian Sea on an interdiction and deterrence mission, Pentagon officials said the deployment -- and Iran's apparent response -- had lowered tensions in the continuing regional proxy war between Tehran and Saudi Arabia.The nine-ship Iranian convoy had turned north and east near the coast of Oman, in the direction of Iran, Defense Department officials said.Col. Steven H. Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said, ""We do not know their future intentions,"" but added that ""it's fair to say that, yes, this appears to be a de-escalation of some of the tensions.""Earlier this week, the convoy had been on a course toward the Yemeni port of Aden, prompting Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter to call on Iran to avoid ""fanning the flames"" of the conflict by delivery weapons.The United States Navy diverted the aircraft carrier group led by the Theodore Roosevelt from its usual position in the Arabian Gulf, through the Strait of Hormuz and into the Arabian Sea to join other American forces conducting maritime security operations in the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden.Defense Department officials said point of the move was twofold: One objective was to reassure Saudi Arabia that the United States was serious in its intent to support gulf allies that have been waging war in Yemen -- even though President Obama had no intention of actually using the carrier group to launch American strikes in Yemen. The second was to send a message to Iran that the United States would not allow weapons shipments to Houthi rebels in Yemen -- even though that same message could have been delivered with a smaller vessel such as a Naval frigate.Defense Department officials privately made the case that, while deploying an aircraft carrier group may have been more than was required, the move got the point across to Iran.""There's very few assets the U.S. military has at its disposal with more deterrent effect than a U.S. aircraft carrier,"" one Defense Department official said, speaking on ground rules of anonymity to discuss internal planning.The official said that while the United States was not planning to launch airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen from the carrier, it was ""important that the Saudis know that we have an arm around their shoulder.""For a month, Saudi Arabia has launched airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. The Obama administration has sided with its Arab ally in the fight, but in recent days has sought to persuade Saudi Arabia to ease off its air campaign as civilian casualties mounted and seek political negotiations. The Saudi airstrikes, though, have continued.Defense Department officials said there were no communications between the American and Iranian ships, and they could not say what type of cargo was being transported, although an arms shipment was suspected.It was unclear whether the United States would have tried to board or stop the Iranian convoy if it had continued toward Yemen; such a move would have risked escalating the conflict in Yemen, and could have stymied fragile negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program.Also Friday, Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's former president and the Houthis' most important ally in the conflict, issued a statement calling on the Houthis to implement United Nations resolutions that require them to withdraw from territory they have occupied, in return for an end to the ""aggression"" by the Saudi-led coalition.Mr. Saleh has remained one of Yemen's most stubbornly resilient and powerful political figures, despite stepping down in 2012 after a domestic uprising against his rule.It was not clear whether his comments on Friday, including a call for warring parties to ""stop fighting"" and engage in dialogue, amounted to another survival tactic or were a genuine attempt to end the conflict.There was no sign that Mr. Saleh's own loyalists were standing down or withdrawing, including from the southern port city of Aden. Units close to Mr. Saleh have made up the bulk of the force fighting in Aden against local southern separatist militiamen, and are accused, along with the Houthis, of carrying out a brutal siege of the city.",1.0
First Evidence of a Blunder: 2 Extra Bodies:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The first sign that something had gone terribly wrong was when officers from the C.I.A. saw that six bodies had been pulled from the rubble instead of four.For weeks, drones had watched the movements of four men around a compound in the Shawal Valley. After the drones struck on Jan. 15, the agency thought that only those four had died.But when six bodies were taken from the wreckage and hastily buried, it was a clear signal that the spy agency had made a deadly mistake. It took weeks for the extent of the disaster to be revealed: The two additional bodies were those of an American and an Italian hostage. One of them was Warren Weinstein, from Rockville, Md., a veteran aid worker who had been held by Al Qaeda since 2011.President Obama said Thursday that his administration was investigating the botched drone strike, carried out in the thickly forested valley that straddles North and South Waziristan in the lawless region of western Pakistan. But serious questions have already emerged -- about the intelligence leading up to the strike, about when American officials knew that the hostages had been killed, and about why it took the White House so long to go public with the information.The weeks leading up to the strike followed a familiar pattern.Armed C.I.A. drones launched from a base in eastern Afghanistan flew over the border into the Shawal Valley, a favored hide-out of militants, and settled into a routine of spying on the comings and goings at a compound in the village of Wacha Dara. The drones monitored the ""pattern of life"" of a group suspected of being militants, believed to be Qaeda operatives and possibly members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, several American officials said.Analysts also eavesdropped on cellphone conversations, another step taken to determine the identities of the suspects and what kind of threat they posed.In Pakistan, unlike elsewhere in the world, the White House permits the C.I.A. to carry out drone strikes without knowing the identities of the people the agency is trying to kill. These ""signature strikes,"" based on patterns of behavior rather than intelligence about specific people, have been criticized in the past as generating a higher number of civilian deaths.American officials acknowledged that the Jan. 15 attack was a signature strike, but said that the C.I.A. had assessed with ""high confidence"" that the compound in the Shawal Valley was being used by Qaeda operatives. The officials said that before every drone strike, whether in Pakistan or elsewhere, the agency must have ""near certainty"" that no civilians will be killed.The strike was conducted despite Mr. Obama's indication in a speech in 2013 that the C.I.A. would no longer conduct such signature strikes after 2014, when American ""combat operations"" in Afghanistan were scheduled to end. Several American officials said Thursday that the deadline had not been enforced.At no time during the weeks of surveillance in the Shawal Valley, the American officials said, did analysts detect any signs that the militants were holding Mr. Weinstein or Giovanni Lo Porto, an Italian aid worker held in Pakistan since 2012.It was not until after the drone strike that C.I.A. analysts -- poring over drone video feeds, satellite data, electronic intercepts of cellphone conversations and informants' reports -- determined that six people had been hauled from the rubble and that there were six graves.""There were two more burials than we expected, and we didn't know who they were,"" said one American official briefed on the investigation.Then, when the C.I.A. pressed informants on the ground for more information and sifted through more intercepts, analysts began hearing ominous talk that ""Westerners"" had been killed.Within weeks of the strike, American intelligence agencies began to pick up information that Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Lo Porto might be dead -- without piecing together that it was the C.I.A. strike that had killed them.The F.B.I. alerted Mr. Weinstein's family in early February that he might have died, according to two American officials and a consultant working on the case, although the F.B.I. was not wholly certain of its information at the time.""They were hearing reports that he was dead and thought it was significant enough to tell his wife,"" said the consultant, who requested anonymity in order to be able to speak about the classified matter. ""But she continued to hold out hope.""At that time, the consultant said, the family assumed that if Mr. Weinstein had died, it was from an illness. The 73-year-old had looked increasingly gaunt and unwell in successive videos that Al Qaeda released during the years the group held him, the most recent this past August, when Al Qaeda addressed the man's family directly and said, ""Your government wants Warren Weinstein to die in prison so that it may absolve itself of responsibility in his case.""After the F.B.I. alerted the Weinstein family, investigators continued to pursue numerous leads and scraps of information. With no ability to send investigators into the tribal areas to gather evidence or talk to possible witnesses, analysts had to piece together a mosaic of information, including more intercepted electronic communications, to try to come to a firm conclusion.American officials eventually determined that the two hostages had either been in the compound before the surveillance began and had never been moved, or had somehow been slipped into the compound during a gap in the American surveillance.""It was in the course of following up on those intelligence leads, and developing intelligence from a wide variety of sources, that the intelligence community was able to assess with high confidence that Dr. Weinstein had been killed,"" Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Thursday.Initial news media reports about that strike were hazy. Some news outlets suggested that fighters loyal to Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a Taliban-affiliated warlord who holds sway in North Waziristan, had been targeted. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry issued a short statement condemning the drone strike.Mr. Obama was finally briefed about the conclusions of the investigation this month. Intelligence officials also briefed members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees that a strong body of evidence indicated that the two aid workers had been killed in the strike.On Wednesday, the day before his announcement, Mr. Obama called Mr. Weinstein's widow, Elaine, and Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, to notify them that the two hostages had been killed during the C.I.A. operation.The bodies of Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Lo Porto remain in Shawal, a long swooping valley walled by snow-dusted peaks. They are buried there along with the bodies of the other four men, not far from the site of the American strike.",1.0
"Putin Bolsters His Forces Near Ukraine, U.S. Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"WASHINGTON -- In a sign that the tense crisis in Ukraine could soon escalate, Russia has continued to deploy air defense systems in eastern Ukraine and has built up its forces near the border, American officials said on Wednesday.Western officials are not sure if the military moves are preparations for a new Russian-backed offensive that would be intended to help the separatists seize additional territory.Some analysts say that President Vladimir V. Putin may not want to act before the European Union reassesses in June whether to ease or keep the economic sanctions it has imposed on Russia because of its annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine. Others say it is possible that Russia is making the moves to increase the pressure on the Ukrainian government to make concessions to the separatists on political and constitutional issues.Either way, the new military activity is a major concern because it has significantly reduced the amount of warning that Ukraine and its Western supporters would have if Russian forces and separatists mounted a joint offensive. And some of Russia's actions, American officials say, are flagrant violations of the cease-fire agreement that European nations negotiated with Russia and Ukraine in February.""This is the highest amount of Russian air defense equipment in eastern Ukraine since August,"" Marie Harf, the State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement. ""Combined Russian-separatist forces continue to violate the terms of the 'Minsk 2' agreement signed in mid-February.""In recent weeks, the war of words over Ukraine has intensified. Last week, Russia charged that a modest program to train Ukraine's national guard that 300 American troops are carrying out in western Ukraine could ""destabilize the situation.""To respond to this and other Russian allegations, the Obama administration declassified intelligence describing a range of Russian military activities in and near Ukraine, which was included in Ms. Harf's statement.Some of the Russian military's air defense systems in Ukraine have been moved closer to the front lines, her statement noted. The Russian military and separatists have also kept substantial communications and other ""command and control"" equipment in eastern Ukraine that would be needed to organize an attack.In addition, the Russian military has been providing extensive training for separatists in eastern Ukraine. Western officials said such training might indicate that the Russian military was looking to play a less obvious role and avoid a possible expansion of sanctions should hostilities resume.The use of Russian reconnaissance drones in the training exercises ""leaves no doubt that Russia is involved in the training,"" Ms. Harf's statement said.Even as it has been training the separatists, the Russian military has been engaged in a buildup near Russia's border with Ukraine.""After maintaining a relatively steady presence along the border, Russia is sending additional units there,"" Ms. Harf's statement said. ""These forces will give Russia its largest presence on the border since October 2014.""The State Department did not say how many Russian troops were arrayed on the border, including near the Russian city of Belgorod. But one Western official, who asked not to be identified because he was discussing intelligence reports, said Russia had moved 12 battalion tactical groups close to the border. The number of troops in such units can vary, but a battalion could have about 1,000 troops.The cease-fire agreement that was negotiated in February in Minsk, Belarus, was supposed to ease political tensions and put an end to the bitter conflict. Germany and France negotiated that accord with Russia and Ukraine. It called for the pulling back of heavy weapons, the removal of foreign forces and the disarming of ""illegal groups.""The Obama administration did not send an official to those talks, but it was in close touch with European officials when the agreement was being negotiated.""Combined Russian-separatist forces maintain a sizable number of artillery pieces and multiple rocket launchers within areas prohibited under the Minsk accords,"" Ms. Harf's statement said. ""Russia has continued to ship heavy weapons into eastern Ukraine.""",1.0
Clashes Intensify Between Armenia and Azerbaijan Over Disputed Land:   [Foreign Desk ],,"AGDAM, Azerbaijan -- Overshadowed by the fighting in Ukraine, another armed conflict in the former Soviet Union -- between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh -- has escalated with deadly ferocity in recent months, killing dozens of soldiers on each side and pushing the countries perilously close to open war.The month of January was heavily stained by blood, with repeated gun battles and volleys of artillery and rocket fire. Two Armenian soldiers were killed and several wounded in a fierce gunfight on Jan. 23 along the conflict's northern front. That set off a weekend of violence including grenade and mortar attacks that killed at least three Azerbaijani soldiers.The most recent clashes prompted an unusually pointed rebuke by international mediators who met on Monday in Krakow, Poland, with the Azerbaijani foreign minister, Elmar Mammadyarov.""The rise in violence that began last year must stop,"" the mediators, from France, Russia and the United States, said in a joint statement, adding, ""We called on Azerbaijan to observe its commitments to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. We also called on Armenia to take all measures to reduce tensions.""Instead, the violence has continued.On Thursday, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry said it had shot down a drone not far from Agdam, an Azerbaijani city that was once home to more than 40,000 people but has been a ghost town for more than 20 years since its occupation by Armenian forces.Tensions are expected to grow even further this year as Armenia prepares to commemorate in April the 100th anniversary of the genocide against Armenians in Turkey.While the fighting here often seems to be an isolated dispute over a mountainous patch of land that no one else wants -- roughly midway between the Armenian capital, Yerevan, and the Azerbaijani capital, Baku -- the conflict poses an ever-present danger by threatening to draw in bigger powers, including Russia, Turkey and Iran.It also provides a chilling warning of what could be in store for Ukraine, where many fear Russia is intent on turning the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk into a similar permanent war zone.The recent flare in fighting has been fueled by a quiet arms race, in which both countries -- but especially oil-rich Azerbaijan -- have built up arsenals of ever more powerful weapons.Russia is the main supplier to each side, even as it claims a leadership role in international peace negotiations, known as the Minsk Group process, which it chairs with the United States and France.In recent weeks, President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan has upped the ante, demanding that the Minsk Group leaders take steps to force Armenia to withdraw from Azerbaijani lands -- nearly one-fifth of Azerbaijan's internationally-recognized territory -- that it has occupied since a truce was signed in 1994.""Measures must be taken,"" Mr. Aliyev said in a speech to government ministers in January. ""The truth is that the continued occupation of our lands is not just the work of Armenia. Armenia is a powerless and poor country. It is in a helpless state. Of course, if it didn't have major patrons in various capitals, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict would have been resolved fairly long ago.""In his speech, Mr. Aliyev warned darkly that Azerbaijan, which has an economy seven times larger than Armenia's, planned this year to spend more than double Armenia's entire annual budget of $2.7 billion on strengthening its military.President Serzh Sargsyan has responded with his own threats. ""The hotheads should expect surprises,"" Mr. Sargsyan said at a recent military ceremony.The dangerous consequences of the arms buildup were on full display in November as Azerbaijan shot down an Mi-24 attack helicopter as it flew just north of Agdam along the cease-fire line, killing three Armenian soldiers on board.The wreckage fell in the region near Agdam that has served as a buffer zone since the 1994 truce, and for days the three bodies lay in the open as Armenian forces seeking to recover their fallen comrades were repelled by gunfire.""This is as bad as it has got since the cease-fire,"" said Thomas de Waal, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, whose book ""Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan Through Peace and War"" is widely regarded as the most authoritative account of the Karabakh conflict.""Fifteen years ago it was still bad but it was just a bunch of trenches with a bunch of soldiers leaning over them with some guns,"" Mr. de Waal said. ""Now, you have this massive heavy weaponry on either side, sometimes only 100 yards from each other, with these drones and so forth.""He added, ""The stakes get higher every year, and the chances of miscalculation get higher as well.""With tensions mounting, visits to each side of the front line, and interviews with senior government and military officials, as well as conversations with dozens of residents, refugees, war veterans, soldiers, local officials, academics, civic activists and even schoolchildren, found the two sides bracing for war, and neither expecting nor prepared for peace.""We have a saying,"" said Col. Abdulla Qurbani, a senior official in the Azerbaijan Defense Ministry, while on a tour of the Azerbaijan side of the line of contact. ""When water mixes with earth, this is mud. When blood mixes with earth, this is motherland.""Across the line in Shushi, a city whose Azerbaijani residents were forced to flee during the war, an Armenian woman, Anaida Gabrielyan, said: ""Our land is soaked in blood. Every millimeter is soaked in grief.""Since fighting began in the late 1980s, it has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than a million, many of whom have been living as refugees for more than 20 years.The increased firepower is not the only reason the conflict has grown more dangerous and more intractable.The fight is rooted in religious hatreds -- real and imagined -- between Christian Armenia and predominantly Muslim Azerbaijan.And a new generation of Armenians and Azerbaijanis, including the soldiers now serving on the front line, cannot remember when their parents and grandparents lived peacefully as neighbors -- before Armenians were purged from Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis were forced from the areas now occupied by Armenia.Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh, where the majority Armenian population declared an independent republic after the collapse of the Soviet Union, are hamstrung by their unrecognized status, which prohibits most international trade.The republic is largely viewed as a puppet extension of Armenia, with its residents traveling abroad on Armenian passports and many Armenian officials, including President Sargsyan, having been born in Nagorno-Karabakh and having previously held government posts there.In casual conversations, it was not uncommon for Azerbaijanis to deny that the Armenian genocide occurred, or for Armenians to insist that Azerbaijanis were not a real nation and had no legitimate ties to lands they had lived on for centuries.""This is our land, our homeland, and we will always protect it,"" said Gayane Gevorgyan, an Armenian and the mother of two young children who now lives in Shushi, a city that before the war had a majority Azerbaijani population. ""We will do it for our children. We have no place else to go.""Although the long history of Azerbaijani residents in Shushi is well documented, and the city contains two famous mosques, Ms. Gevorgyan said that Azerbaijanis expelled during the war had no right to return.""We were part of greater Armenia even before Christ,"" she said in an interview at the State Historical Museum, where she works as a guide. ""Shushi is not their homeland, so they don't have any right to come back.""In Azerbaijan, there is a city government-in-exile with a single-minded focus on reclaiming the city, called Shusha in Azerbaijani. ""Our only goal is to come back,"" said Bayram A. Safarov, the head of the administration in exile. ""I know every stone there.""The hardened views in the public mind make it even more difficult to broker an accord, despite Presidents Aliyev and Sargsyan's having met three times last year.""The reality is after 20 years of inflammatory rhetoric, both presidents will admit to you that the people of the two countries are just not ready,"" said one Western official who has met both men, and who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations on sensitive diplomatic issues.In Azerbaijan, tens of thousands of refugees live in substandard housing. In some cases, families have lived for years in individual college dormitory rooms, sharing a bathroom on the hall.Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh are hamstrung by their unrecognized status, which prohibits most international trade.The region's capital, called Stepanakert in Armenian and Xankendi in Azerbaijani, has no functioning airport. And officials there do not have a formal role in the peace process.Irina Khachaturyan, who sells trinkets from a stall in the central market in Stepanakert, is Armenian but said she dreamed of returning to Baku, the Azerbaijani capital where she lived before the war.""It was my motherland; I was born there, lived there, studied there,"" Ms. Khachaturyan said.Although she lives among fellow Armenians, she said Stepanakert never became home.""I never found my place,"" she said. ""These 25 years, I have been living like on needles.""",1.0
Ukraine Fighting Continues as Talks Stall:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ARTEMOVSK, Ukraine -- Envoys representing Ukraine, Russia and a European monitoring group opened a new round of cease-fire talks on Saturday aimed at ending a two-week-old flare-up in violence in the Ukraine war.The talks have been halting. Plans to start on Friday fell through when no senior officials showed up in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, where the negotiations are being held.It was unclear how much could be done to tamp down violence and head off new sanctions; although a Russian envoy arrived for the talks, Russian-backed separatist leaders did not.Russia insists that it does not formally represent the separatists in eastern Ukraine, although Western governments have imposed economic sanctions on Russia for backing them.Denis Pushilin, a negotiator for separatists in one rebellious region, Donetsk, said the leaders of the self-proclaimed republics there and in Luhansk, another rebel-controlled region, would not engage in cease-fire talks unless Ukraine declared a truce first.The breakaway leaders, he told Interfax, will otherwise need to remain focused on fighting the war and protecting civilians.""Firing by Ukrainian government troops has to stop, because our leaders are fully involved in repelling attacks,"" Mr. Pushilin said.The top Ukrainian, Russian and European envoys -- former President Leonid D. Kuchma of Ukraine; Russia's ambassador to Ukraine, Mikhail Y. Zurabov; and a representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Heidi Tagliavini -- met Saturday.In a statement issued late Saturday, Mr. Kuchma demanded that the pro-Russian side comply with the previously agreed upon truce and stop trying to impose new demands. ""The Ukrainian side does not accept any ultimatums or preliminary conditions,"" Mr. Kuchma said .In Ukraine, the fighting has grown worse by the day.Artillery shells exploded in Debaltseve, the Ukrainian-held town south of here that is surrounded on three sides by separatist forces and resupplied by only a single, tenuous 31-mile-long road. Shelling in Debaltseve killed 12 civilians on Saturday, the police said. The day before, shells killed 14 people in Donetsk.",1.0
"Iran Releases Cargo Vessel, Shipper Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"A Maersk Line cargo vessel impounded at gunpoint more than a week ago by Iran's naval patrol boats in the Strait of Hormuz was released on Thursday after talks between the shipper and the Iranian authorities.Iran's seizure of the vessel, the Maersk Tigris, over what the Iranians described as the enforcement of a civil court judgment, had threatened to raise tensions in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital Persian Gulf waterway. Warships from the United States Navy had been assigned to escort American and British commercial shipping in response; those escorts have now ended, a Pentagon spokesman said.The Maersk Line, the Danish shipping giant, confirmed in a statement that the vessel and its 24-member crew, forced to anchor near Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas on April 28, were en route to the port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.""Maersk Line is pleased and relieved to learn that the Maersk Tigris has been released by the Iranian authorities,"" a spokesman for the shipper, Michael C. Storgaard, said in the statement.The Maersk Tigris is registered in the Marshall Islands. It is managed and staffed by Rickmers Shipmanagement, a subsidiary of Rickmers Group, a German maritime services company, which reported that the crew was in good condition. The resolution reflected what analysts called a desire by Iran and the United States to avert sabotaging the nuclear talks between Iran and a group of six powers that includes the United States.",1.0
Top Qaeda Figure Dies in Yemen Drone Strike:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- An American drone strike in a southern port city of Yemen last month killed a senior operative of the Qaeda branch in that country who had recently emerged as a public face of the group, it announced on Thursday.The Qaeda operative, Nasr bin Ali al-Ansi, had appeared in some of the group's most significant public announcements, including a video claiming credit for the deadly attack on the French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo. A statement disseminated by the group, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, known as A.Q.A.P., said that Mr. Ansi had died along with his son and six Qaeda fighters during a strike in the port city of Mukalla.The news of Mr. Ansi's death came as American drone operations were under new scrutiny. Last month, President Obama announced that a C.I.A. drone strike in Pakistan in January had inadvertently killed two Western hostages, including an American aid worker, Warren Weinstein.American officials would not confirm the death of Mr. Ansi or say whether there had been an operation intended to kill him. Spokesmen for the White House and the C.I.A. declined to comment. A spokesman for the National Counterterrorism Center referred questions to the Pentagon, but Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter declined to provide details about the strike during a news conference on Thursday.""We just don't talk about those, and certainly not from this podium,"" he said.Mr. Ansi acted as an A.Q.A.P. spokesman in a December video in which he issued an ultimatum to the United States that the group would kill the American hostage Luke Somers if the government did not meet A.Q.A.P.'s demands within three days. Mr. Somers was killed on the day the deadline expired, after a failed rescue effort by American Special Operations troops.He appeared in another video the next month, after two gunmen stormed the office of Charlie Hebdo. The attack killed 12 people, including its editorial director, Stéphane Charbonnier, whose caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad had put him on Al Qaeda's most wanted list. American officials later confirmed that one of the gunmen had received military training in an A.Q.A.P. camp in Yemen.An A.Q.A.P. online obituary of Mr. Ansi said that he was born in 1975 in Taiz, a Yemeni city in the highlands above the Red Sea. He fought in Bosnia and later in Afghanistan, where he met Osama bin Laden, according to a translation of the obituary by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks extremist messages.""The knight dismounted from his horse after long years spent traveling between various fields of jihad in the east and west of the land, from the Philippines to Kashmir, and from Afghanistan and Tajikistan to Yemen,"" said the obituary. ""He waged jihad with his teeth and his tongue.""Yemen for years has been wracked by poverty, civil war and terrorism. It has been further destabilized in recent months by a Shiite rebel group's takeover of the capital, Sana, and a bombing campaign led by Saudi Arabia to oust the group from the city.A.Q.A.P. appears to be capitalizing on the chaos, expanding the territory it controls in the southern part of the country.Since President Obama announced the death of Mr. Weinstein last month, some lawmakers have tried to breathe life into an administration proposal to move the bulk of drone operations from the C.I.A. to the Pentagon. Two years ago, the White House announced its intention to make the shift, but the initiative has stalled mostly.One of the stated reasons for having the Pentagon run the drone program is that it would bring greater transparency to a program that remains classified, even if it is hardly a secret.Mr. Carter, the defense secretary, said on Thursday that the Pentagon was ready to assume control of the program if asked, and that Mr. Obama believed ""in being as transparent as we possibly can with all the measures we take to protect America.""But, he quickly added that he could not discuss where the strikes take place, ""because that's in the nature of things.""",1.0
Europe; Ukraine: Soldiers Die in Strife in the Separatist East,,"Ukrainian military officials said Wednesday that five soldiers had been killed and 12 wounded in fighting in the separatist east, casting further doubt on the prospects for a months-old cease-fire that has never fully taken hold.

Saudi-Led Group Said to Use Cluster Bombs in Yemen:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- The Saudi-led military coalition fighting a rebel group in Yemen has in the past few weeks used cluster munitions supplied by the United States, Human Rights Watch said in a report released on Sunday.The report said video, photographs and other evidence showed that the coalition had used cluster bombs near villages in Yemen's northern Saada Province. The group, which said it had found evidence that the weapons had been deployed on at least two separate occasions, has not been able to establish whether any casualties had resulted from their use, according to the report.Cluster munitions, which are banned by much of the world, though not by the United States, Saudi Arabia or Yemen, are considered imprecise weapons that spread ordnance over a wide area and pose a long-term danger to civilians because of the unexploded bomblets they leave behind.Saudi Arabia has come under growing international criticism for the high civilian death toll during its aerial campaign, which has been carried out over more than five weeks alongside a coalition of Arab states and with intelligence and logistical support from the United States.More than 1,000 people have been killed in fighting since late March, when the Saudis said their military was intervening to roll back the gains of the Houthis, a Shiite rebel group that had captured large parts of Yemen and forced the president, supported by Saudi Arabia, into exile.There have been no precise tallies of deaths caused by the airstrikes, in part because of the difficulties human rights groups face in accessing many parts of Yemen. Dozens of people have been killed at a time in several well-documented bombings, including airstrikes near a military base in Yemen's capital, Sana; at a dairy factory near the city of Al Hudaydah; and at a camp for internally displaced people in northern Yemen.At least two fatal airstrikes were reported on Friday, according to officials and witnesses.A bomb that struck a residential area in Sana killed at least 14 people, including at least five members of one family, according to officials and local witnesses.Airstrikes also hit a government building south of Taiz that residents said was being used as a field hospital by the Houthis. A local resident said at least a dozen people were killed, while an official Houthi-run news media outlet put the toll at dozens, without mentioning that a field hospital had been hit.Hundreds of other people have been killed during fighting in the southern city of Aden, where the Houthis and their allies are accused of targeting residential neighborhoods with sniper and heavy weapons fire.In its report, Human Rights Watch, based in New York, said photographs taken at the site of an airstrike on April 17 showed remnants of a type of cluster munitions that has been supplied in recent years by the United States to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The United Arab Emirates is part of the military coalition.Before the airstrikes cited by Human Rights Watch, a Saudi military spokesman had denied that the coalition was using cluster bombs, the group said, citing a local news media report.Both Saudi and American military forces have deployed cluster munitions in Yemen before the most recent conflict, according to human rights groups. In 2009, Saudi warplanes dropped cluster bombs during attacks on the Houthis in Saada, their home province.The same year, United States naval forces fired one or more cruise missiles containing cluster munitions at a suspected Qaeda training camp in southern Yemen. Yemeni officials said the attack had killed at least 14 militants and dozens of civilians.",1.0
Strikes on Syria Tied to Deaths of 52 Civilians:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Airstrikes by the American-led coalition against Islamic State militants have killed several dozen people in northern Syria, with the death toll from Friday's attacks rising to more than 52 civilians on Saturday, according to a Syrian monitoring group and local activists.The attacks on the village of Bir Mahli, in Aleppo Province, east of the Euphrates River, killed at least nine children, said the group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is based in Britain and monitors the violence in Syria through a network of contacts inside the country.Since September, the United States and allied countries have been conducting airstrikes in Syria and Iraq against militants of the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL.According to the tallies of airstrikes that the United States Central Command routinely releases, there were several in ""the area of"" Kobani, a town near the Turkish border, north of Bir Mahli, that were said to have hit Islamic State positions, vehicles and ""tactical units.""""We have no information to corroborate allegations that coalition airstrikes resulted in civilian casualties,"" Capt. John J. Moore said in an email. ""Regardless, we take all allegations seriously and will look into them further.""A local Kurdish activist, Perwer Mohammad Ali, confirmed that civilians had been killed in strikes on Bir Mahli on Friday. He said that while many Kurds had fled the ethnically mixed villages since the militants arrived in the area, some Arab civilians still lived in the village.The Observatory said that members of at least six families were killed, along with some Islamic State fighters, and that 13 were missing.",1.0
Saudi-Led Strikes Hit Yemeni Civilians Hard:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- In one of Yemen's largest cities, residents have been reduced to a diet of rice. In another, they sleep overnight in lines waiting for gasoline. Hospitals may soon be forced to close, bombs and shells are raining down ever more thickly and randomly, and in places snipers target anyone brave or desperate enough to walk the streets.Five weeks after the start of a Saudi-led bombing campaign, more than 1,000 Yemenis have died in the fighting, and the United Nations says that at least 300,000 people have been displaced, forced to hunt for food and fuel in a country bereft of both. Fierce fighting in the port city of Aden has killed dozens of people in the last few days, left neighborhoods in flames and set off a panicked exodus.On Thursday, little more than a week after Saudi Arabia said it was shifting the focus of its military operations in Yemen to make way for political negotiations and humanitarian relief, residents of the capital, Sana, were subjected to some of the heaviest airstrikes since the bombing began.The worsening humanitarian crisis, a deepening civil war that threatens to inflame the regional struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran and little evidence that either side is winning or seriously pursuing negotiations have raised stark questions about the strategic goals of the Saudi-led military campaign and the international response.""It's insanity -- here are 25 million people in the middle of this conflict,"" said Nuha Abdulljabbar, a humanitarian coordinator for Oxfam, a British charity. The combatants, she added, are ""condemning the whole country to die.""Indeed, this week, coalition warplanes bombed at least two airports to prevent an Iranian plane from landing; the strikes damaged a runway that was being used for international aid deliveries. And the fighting, as well as a naval cordon set up by the coalition, is blocking deliveries of fuel and food by sea to a country that depends critically on imports.Under heavy international pressure, including from the United States, the Saudis announced last week that they were ending the first phase of their military campaign against the Houthis, a northern Yemeni rebel group that has captured large parts of the country over the last eight months, including Sana.But instead of scaling back the airstrikes, the coalition has broadened them, demonstrating what appears to be a determination to defeat the Houthis, rather than any inclination to negotiate with the group, which is allied with Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. They have also started more aggressively supplying weapons to the Houthis' adversaries, according to fighters in Aden and Taiz, even though those weapons have frequently ended up in the hands of the Houthis or profiteers.Saudi Arabia had threatened a ground invasion of Yemen, but faced difficulties persuading allies to provide troops for such an operation. Instead, analysts said, the Saudis were likely to intensify their efforts to support proxy forces in Yemen, a strategy they have used before.A Reuters article on Wednesday quoted a Yemeni official saying the Saudis had trained hundreds of Yemeni tribesmen to fight the Houthis, though Saudi officials did not confirm the report.For their part, the Houthis and their allies -- forces loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh, the former president -- have also brushed off negotiations in favor of expanding their bloody offensive aimed at controlling strategic cities.And the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whom the Saudis had promised to restore to power, remains outside Yemen, trying to influence events from hundreds of miles away in the Saudi capital, Riyadh.While the fighting rages, the civilians suffer. On Tuesday, the Saudi-led coalition struck near a military base in Sana that residents said had already been bombed dozens of times over the last month.Airstrikes in the area on April 20 set off a huge explosion that flattened much of a nearby residential area, killing at least 36 people and wounding hundreds. Residents picking through the debris were still in shock days later, after the bombing had been eclipsed by more battles and bloodshed.Hussein Mahdi Howban, a 25-year-old student, said the blast had blown out the doors and windows of his apartment and sent him flying through the air. Covered in blood and dust, he stumbled outside to find that the explosion had brought buildings and utility poles down on top of families. ""I saw my neighbors crying, screaming,"" he said.The Houthis' attempts to capture Aden and Taiz, Yemen's third-largest city, have taken a crushing toll on residents. Witnesses said the Houthis had all but demolished the Khormaksar neighborhood in central Aden over the last few days, ordering locals to leave and then blowing up houses with tank fire. Houthi fighters also occupied a hospital in the neighborhood as patients and doctors fled, according to residents and aid workers.As sections of Aden were reduced to rubble, supplies dwindled for survivors. ""Lunch is rice, dinner is rice,"" said Faris al-Shuabi, a Khormaksar resident. ""Rice is the main meal.""In Taiz, northwest of Aden, the Houthi and Saleh forces have been accused of using similarly indiscriminate force, hitting at least two hospitals during clashes.The number of Yemenis fleeing the combat is sharply increasing, the United Nations said this week. Its estimate of 300,000 people displaced within the country doubled in just 11 days.Yemenis on the run are finding fewer and fewer places untouched by the war. The shortages of fuel and food are crippling Taiz and Aden, as well as Sana and other northern areas.Shipments to Yemen have been blocked by the fighting at its ports, including Aden, and by the naval cordon imposed by the Saudi-led coalition, which inspects all shipments, according to shipping industry analysts.Several fuel tankers are believed to be offshore, waiting to dock in Hodeidah. It was unclear if the coalition was stopping them or if they were standing off for other reasons, including their safety, the analysts said.In Sana, people seeking fuel are waiting in line for days. ""People sleep at the gas stations,"" said Marie Claire Feghali, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross who is based in Sana.The fuel shortage has set off a ""vicious circle"" of suffering, she said. Yemen, which imports 90 percent of its food, has received hardly any food shipments in the last five weeks, and without fuel, there is no way to transport what little food is available.In a nation already severely short of water, water pumps depend on fuel to operate. So do power generators, and the cold storage areas for medicines and vaccinations in hospitals.The Yemeni authorities said this week that they might have to shut down the telecommunications network as well, further isolating a population that is increasingly cut off from the world.One city seemed to be escaping the worst of the crisis: the southern port of Al Mukalla, which has been controlled by the local Qaeda branch since early April.The militants have focused on security, and the city has been administered by a council of residents and tribal leaders under their supervision. Though fuel is in short supply, there have been no lines at bakeries, and the shops are still stocked with food, said Faris bin Hilabi, a local businessman.Dairy products have been arriving overland from Oman, and other essentials have come from Saudi Arabia, Mr. Hilabi said. The coalition authorities have allowed at least one ship to dock in the port with a load of sugar, and a shipment of wheat from Ukraine is on the way.Sana has not been as lucky. On Thursday, after workers had repaired the runway at the international airport so flights could resume, the Saudi-led coalition bombed the airport again.",1.0
U.S. Raises Profile in Strait of Hormuz After Iranians Seize a Cargo Vessel:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The Navy on Thursday began deploying warships to protect American commercial vessels passing through the Strait of Hormuz against any interference from Iran, which this week seized a cargo ship in the narrow waterway, though which about 20 percent of the world's oil passes.Military officials said American warships and aircraft would maintain a presence in and around the strait and stay in contact with some American cargo ships traversing the sea lane, which separates the Persian Gulf from the Arabian Sea. But the officials drew a distinction between the new effort, which they characterized as ""accompanying"" commercial vessels, and escorting ships, which would involve convoys led by warships.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter approved the new policy on Thursday, said the officials, who cast it as a show of force intended to discourage Iran from making any aggressive moves against American shipping in the strait. At least one American ship has passed through the strait under the eye of the Navy, they said.The military is trying to balance the need to protect shipping against a recognition that taking an overly aggressive posture could upset negotiations on a nuclear deal between Iran and the United States and other powers.""This is more of a show-of-the-flag presence than any sort of specific threat they're trying to prevent,"" said a Defense Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the policy had not been publicly released. ""It's a freedom-of-navigation issue.""Still, other American officials said there had been growing concerns in recent weeks that Iranian gunboats were harassing cargo ships passing through the strait, part of which includes Iran's territorial waters. Iranian gunboats, for instance, trailed an American-flagged container ship, the Maersk Kensington, through the strait last Friday.Then, on Tuesday, Iranian forces fired shots across the bow of the Maersk Tigris, a container ship registered in the Marshall Islands, which has close ties to the United States. The Iranians then seized the ship and detained its crew, which was sailing to a port near Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, from Jidda, Saudi Arabia.Maersk, the Danish shipping giant, said on Thursday that the seizure of the Tigris stemmed from a decade-long legal dispute over 10 shipping containers that were sent from Iran to the United Arab Emirates in 2005.But it is unusually aggressive to detain a cargo ship at gunpoint over a legal claim, and the United States sent a destroyer, the Farragut, to the Persian Gulf after the Iranian move.Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said on Thursday that ""American naval forces will continue to monitor the situation.""Other American officials said the Farragut, which carries a helicopter, was to remain in the area and help accompany shipping through the strait. It will be joined by coastal patrol ships, which are armed.No time limit has been set on the operation, the officials said, and they had no details on how many American ships pass through the strait.""Bottom line, this is a precautionary move to simply maintain a credible U.S. naval presence and ensure freedom of navigation,"" a senior military official said. ""It's what navies do. We'll continue to monitor and assess as we seek to keep tensions low and adjust as needed.""Iran appeared to be similarly aware of the risks of letting the seizure of the Tigris harm the nuclear talks. The deal would ease sanctions against Iran in exchange for Tehran's abandoning its nuclear weapons programs.The Iranian government's Port and Maritime Organization this week sought to keep the two issues from becoming entangled, saying the Tigris seizure ""has a legal aspect, and relating it to political issues could be due to unawareness of the regulations and the case.""The 10 containers in question, which were sent by an Iranian company, were never picked up. After 90 days, ""the cargo was disposed of"" by government authorities in line with local law, Maersk said.The disposal of the crates led to court battles in several Iranian courts. Maersk said that on Feb. 18, a court ordered it to pay $163,000, which the company said it was willing to pay. But Maersk said it was told on Thursday that a higher court had ordered it to pay $3.6 million.""As we do not have the details of the ruling, we are not able to comment hereon, nor at this point speculate on our options,"" the company said.The Iran port agency's statement identified the Iranian company that sued Maersk as the Pars Talaee Oil Production Company. The statement said that the agency had been notified of the verdict and that it ""was implemented by the operational forces.""The 10 containers were said to hold equipment for oil drilling and production.The Tigris is chartered by Maersk, but owned and operated by a Singapore company, Rickmers Shipmanagement. The company initially said the crew consisted of Eastern Europeans and Asians, but has since said that there was one Briton aboard as well.A Rickmers official was allowed to see the crew on Thursday for the first time since the seizure, and the company said that ""given the current circumstances, they are all in a good condition.""",1.0
China and Russia to Hold Mediterranean Exercises:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. HONG KONG -- The Chinese Navy will hold joint exercises with Russia in the Mediterranean in May, China's Defense Ministry said Thursday, a further indication of the closer ties between the two countries and of the navy's increasing ambitions.Nine ships from the two countries will participate in the drills, including Chinese vessels now on antipiracy patrols in waters off the Horn of Africa, the Defense Ministry spokesman, Geng Yansheng, said at a monthly news briefing in Beijing. The drills will focus on navigation safety, at-sea replenishment, escort missions and live-fire exercises, he said.""The aim is to deepen both countries' friendly and practical cooperation and increase our navies' ability to jointly deal with maritime security threats,"" Mr. Geng said. ""These exercises are not aimed at any third party and have nothing to do with the regional situation.""One of China's main military goals is to develop a navy that goes beyond coastal waters and can travel the world's oceans, and while military analysts said the drills in the Mediterranean appeared to be modest, they would be the farthest from home the Chinese Navy has done.""The Chinese fleet has never made any exercises in the Mediterranean, and moreover, this is with Russia,"" said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.""The two countries want to show they have escalated their strategic partnership.""China's announcement came as the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was visiting Washington. He and President Obama declared that Japan and the United States would increase their military cooperation, a move that China criticized Wednesday.With Russia's isolation from the West over the crisis in Ukraine, and with China's concern about a more intimate American-Japanese alliance, it suits President Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to advertise their friendship, Professor Shi said.""Russia wants to show the United States it is not isolated and can launch exercises near Eastern Europe,"" he said. ""And as a result of Abe's visit to the United States and the upgraded Japan-American military relationship, Xi wants to show the United States he has good relations with Russia.""The fact that the Chinese Navy is venturing so far from home for military exercises shows that it has a new confidence in its abilities, said James Hardy, the Asia-Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defense Weekly.""The geopolitical significance of its exercising alongside Russia will not be lost on the U.S. and NATO,"" he said, ""although it would be churlish of anyone in the West to complain about it, given the number of joint drills the U.S. and its allies conduct in China's near seas.""The Chinese Navy has operated in the Mediterranean before, most notably when China's warships helped rescue more than 30,000 Chinese workers stranded in Libya after the downfall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011. It also sent a frigate to accompany the removal of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile in 2013 and 2014.""So this isn't entirely new territory,"" Mr. Hardy said.China's contribution to the exercises will include two frigates and a supply ship used in the evacuation of Chinese citizens and others from Yemen in April, Mr. Geng said. Those ships were dispatched from the antipiracy patrols to carry out the evacuation.The exercises themselves are probably not as important as the message, said Peter Dutton, a professor of strategic studies at the United States Naval War College in Newport, R.I.""It suggests Russia and China are sending a political signal to the U.S. and Europe that the continental powers are standing together to support each other's expanding interests in the face of maritime opposition,"" he said.The Chinese and Russian Navies have exercised together since 2012 in waters off Russia's eastern seaboard.Mr. Geng did not give a date for the exercises, but it appeared that they would be held after the May 9 military parade in Moscow commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany. President Xi has accepted an invitation to attend the ceremony, and a large contingent of Chinese military personnel is scheduled to march in the parade.European leaders, angered by Russia's actions in Ukraine, have refused invitations, leaving Mr. Xi as the most prominent guest at an event that is likely to be further public confirmation of the cordial Russia-China relations.The joint naval exercises come a year after Russia announced that it would sell the S-400 surface-to-air missile system to China, a sale it had been reluctant to make because of fears of reverse engineering by the Chinese.",1.0
World Briefing | Europe; Finland: Mystery Vessel Stokes Anxiety:   [Foreign Desk ],,"LONDON -- Finnish officials said on Wednesday that they were still in the dark about the origin of an underwater vessel that a day earlier had prompted the navy to fire depth charges -- the first such warning in more than 10 years, according to local news media.The episode generated anxiety in Finland, which shares a long border with Russia and where memories of the Cold War run deep. News of the warning shots stirred speculation in the Finnish news media that the unidentified object, thought to be a submarine, had been sent by Moscow.Max Arhippainen, a spokesman for the Finnish Ministry of Defense, said the country was being vigilant at a time of heightened anxieties in the region. He said that such warning shots were a very rare event and stressed that the nationality of the unidentified vessel was not known. ""We don't know what the object was, but the navy had enough reason to take action and to launch a warning explosive,"" he said by phone from Helsinki, the capital.While declining to be drawn on possible Russian involvement, he said, ""We have seen more Russian activity in the Baltic area. To some degree, people are more worried than before.""According to Reuters, Defense Minister Carl Haglund told the Finnish news agency STT that the strange activity had prompted the navy to take action. ""We strongly suspect that there has been underwater activity that does not belong there,"" Mr. Haglund said. ""Of course it is always serious if our territorial waters have been violated.""Finland's action comes at a time of tense East-West relations after Russia's annexation of Crimea and the conflict between government forces and pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.In Finland, Russia has long cast a shadow. Finland was part of the Russian Empire until it gained independence in 1917. Traditionally a nonaligned country outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Finland pursued a policy of ""active neutrality"" at the height of the Cold War, a tactic aimed at keeping the Soviet Union at arm's length. However, since the Ukraine crisis erupted, a debate on whether to join NATO has intensified.An editorial Wednesday in Helsingin Sanomat, a leading Finnish newspaper, said that the detection of the unidentified object was a ""serious event"" and reflected resurgent activity by Russia in the Baltic Sea. Noting that relations between Russia and the West had been inflamed by events in Ukraine, it said that territorial violations had taken on added importance. ""In more tranquil times, these kind of violations would not inspire the kind of concern that they do now,"" it said.Mikko Majander, an adjunct professor of political history at the University of Helsinki, said alarm over the event reflected a basic insecurity about Russia in the region that had recently been revived. ""We haven't felt threatened by Russia for a long time,"" he said. ""But now there is so much more uncertainty about Russia's intentions compared with before.""In October, an unidentified vessel spotted off the Stockholm archipelago prompted Sweden's largest mobilization since the end of the Cold War, and finger-pointing at Russia. The mystery, including unsubstantiated reports of a man in black spotted wading near the vessel, captured the nation's imagination. But the Kremlin issued vehement denials and said the vessel belonged to another country, while Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a Russian government newspaper, accused Sweden of scaremongering about Russia.Last year, Norway intercepted 74 Russian warplanes off its coast, 27 percent more than in 2013, and a substantial jump from the 11 detected a decade earlier.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
"Saudis Hit Airport in Yemen, Possibly Closing Aid Route:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SANA, Yemen -- A Saudi-led military coalition carried out at least seven airstrikes on the international airport here on Tuesday, possibly crippling the airport in order to prevent an Iranian airplane from landing, according to Saudi and Yemeni officials.The airstrikes hit the main runway, endangering one of Yemen's last usable airports and a major transit point for global aid shipments. An airport official said the damage had made it impossible to use the runway.The bombings demonstrated the extent to which Yemen has become trapped in the escalating regional proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia began its bombing campaign against the Houthi rebel movement in Yemen last month in large part to counter what Saudi officials saw as the influence of Iran, which has supported the Houthis.Saudi accusations that the Houthis were acting as an instrument of Iranian power were viewed by many Yemenis and Western diplomats as exaggerated or misplaced. Even so, the war in Yemen has ratcheted up tensions, raising fears of a broader conflict.Yemen's airspace and seas have been tightly controlled by the Saudi-led coalition since the beginning of the offensive. The United Nations Security Council has also imposed an arms embargo on the Houthis.A Saudi military spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday that the Iranian airplane had not coordinated its landing in Sana with the coalition authorities and had ignored warnings to turn back.Iran's state news agency said that the aircraft was an Iranian Red Crescent plane that had been carrying food and medicine. A list of flights provided by a Yemeni airport official showed that the flight had been expected and had been one of four flights scheduled to land in the airport on Tuesday. The purpose of the Iranian flight, operated by Mahan Air, was listed as ""passenger trip.""The strikes destroyed at least one commercial plane on the tarmac, according to witnesses.The bombing of the airport threatened what had been one of Yemen's few lifelines for international aid shipments, to counter what relief agencies say are critical shortages of medicine, food, fuel and other supplies. Relief officials are warning that the shortages are causing a humanitarian disaster. The United Nations said on Monday that hospitals in Yemen will shut down within a week unless they receive more fuel.On Tuesday, the United Nations said that new data showed that the number of people displaced because of the war had more than doubled in less than two weeks, to 300,000 people from an estimated 150,000 people 11 days ago.",1.0
Saudi-Led Air Campaign Resumes in Yemeni Capital:   [Foreign Desk ],,"AL MUKALLA, Yemen -- Warplanes of the Saudi-led military coalition bombed targets in the Yemeni capital on Sunday for the first time since Saudi officials said they were shifting the focus of their campaign against a Yemeni rebel group toward political negotiations and humanitarian relief.Also on Sunday, at least seven people were killed and dozens wounded in escalating violence in the southern city of Taiz, which was emerging as the latest lethal flash point in Yemen's civil war.In addition to the bombings in Sana, the capital, which struck a military base and the presidential palace, the coalition carried out airstrikes in several other provinces, suggesting a broadening, rather than a scaling back, of the monthlong Saudi air offensive against Houthi rebels.Despite vague talk of negotiations last week, there was little sign that any of the combatants in Yemen's conflict were preparing to halt the fighting. Rather, the violence heightened in recent days as it became more apparent that the warring parties were locked in a standoff, with the Saudis insisting that the Houthis retreat and the Houthis demanding an unconditional end to the airstrikes.Saudi Arabia said the military operation was intended to shake the grip of the Houthis on crucial Yemeni cities and to restore the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was forced from power and into exile, by the Houthis this year.But the air campaign has killed scores of civilians and earned derision from critics in Yemen and abroad who have called it strategically incoherent for failing to either dislodge the Houthis and their allies or to force them to negotiate.Nonetheless, Saudi officials asserted last week that the campaign, which they called Operation Decisive Storm, had achieved its objectives and that they would shift from military operations to a political process. But on Sunday, a senior Yemeni official, Riyadh Yaseen, who serves as the foreign minister for the Saudi-backed exiled government, said the first operation had ""not ended.""""There will be no deal with the Houthis whatsoever until they withdraw from areas under their control,"" Mr. Yaseen said, speaking in London, according to Reuters.More than 1,000 people have been killed over the past month, including at least 500 civilians, according to the United Nations. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aden, Yemen's second largest city, which has been devastated by factional street fighting for more than a month.There are growing fears that Taiz, a densely populated city northwest of Aden, is suffering the same fate as clashes there intensify. The city has already experienced severe shortages of fuel and food, residents said.As in Aden, local forces were fighting against an alliance of the Houthis and heavily armed security units loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's former autocratic president.Taiz was a focal point of the nationwide uprising against Mr. Saleh in 2011 that led to a deal brokered by Persian Gulf nations that removed him from power. Residents said the local militias opposing the Houthi and Saleh forces now include many young people who participated in the protests four years ago.A prominent, longtime opponent of Mr. Saleh, Sheik Hamoud Saeed al-Mikhlafi, was said to be leading the opposition to Mr. Saleh's forces in Taiz.As they meet fierce resistance in the city, the Houthis and their allies have been accused by residents of deploying deadly and frequently indiscriminate force. Witnesses said that on Sunday, the Houthis unleashed barrages of mortar shells that struck at least one hospital.Ali al-Sirari, a local human rights activist, said the shelling by the Houthis came after they were forced to retreat. They ""hysterically shelled many areas in the city with tanks,"" he said. Residents said at least seven people, including three children, were killed.Photograph People Sifted Through the Rubble of a Home After an Airstrike in Sana, Yemen, Where Saudi Arabia Resumed Its Offensive Against the Houthi Rebels.

U.S. Says Drone Killed an ISIS Operative:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- An American drone strike last week killed a midlevel operative with the Islamic State who had been a conduit for the militant group's outreach to extremists in North Africa, Defense Department officials said on Monday.The Pentagon said that the militant, Tariq bin al-Tahar bin al-Falih al-'Awni al-Harzi, a Tunisian who had been a ""person of interest"" in the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, died in coordinated airstrikes on Islamic State targets near Mosul, Iraq, on June 15.A military official declined to say how the Pentagon had received proof that Mr. Harzi was killed, but said there was now certainty that ""the airstrike struck its intended target.""In announcing the June 15 airstrikes last week, the United States Central Command said that American warplanes had conducted seven strikes, hitting two Islamic State tactical units, one fighting position, a mortar firing position, an excavator, a rocket system, a structure and a vehicle. One military official said that Mr. Harzi was in the vehicle, and that there were no known civilian casualties.Col. Steve Warren, a Defense Department spokesman, said on Monday that Mr. Harzi had operated closely with extremist groups throughout North Africa and the Middle East. ""His death,"" Colonel Warren said, ""degrades ISIL's ability to integrate North African jihadists into the Syrian and Iraqi fight and removes a jihadist with long ties to international terrorism."" ISIL is an alternative acronym for the Islamic State.Last month, the State Department announced multimillion-dollar rewards for information leading to the whereabouts of four Islamic State leaders, including Mr. Harzi.Mr. Harzi ""played an increasingly important role for ISIL as a jack-of-all-trades,"" said Seth G. Jones, a terrorism specialist at the RAND Corporation. ""He recruited fighters from Europe and North Africa, helped them travel to Iraq and Syria, procured weapons and other matériel, and organized attacks. This made him an extremely dangerous enemy for the U.S. and a versatile asset for ISIL. In addition, his links with ISIL recruitment and financial networks in such locations as Europe, Africa and the Persian Gulf helped ISIL expand from a local group to a more globalized organization.""Mr. Harzi's role in the Benghazi attacks remained unclear on Monday. That attack, on Sept. 11, 2012, killed J.

27 Are Killed by Rockets in Ukraine:   [Foreign Desk ],,"DONETSK, Ukraine -- A barrage of rockets struck homes and a market in the Azov Sea port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, killing 27 people and wounding 97 others, the Interior Ministry said.It was the latest indication that after a relative lull last fall, the war has flared up again in eastern Ukraine, with lethal artillery strikes landing in both rebel- and Ukrainian-controlled regions.A leader of the Russian-backed rebels, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, has said his forces are now on the offensive, and on Saturday he said that an assault had begun against Mariupol, a strongly pro-Ukrainian seaside city with a prewar population of about 400,000 but now bulging with thousands of refugees from Crimea and elsewhere in eastern Ukraine.""We began our attack on Mariupol,"" Mr. Zakharchenko said at a memorial for victims of a recent artillery bombardment of a bus stop in Donetsk. Both sides blame the other for that attack, and estimates of the number of dead are contested, ranging from eight to 13.Mr. Zakharchenko said that separatist forces had also begun an attack on a road and railroad hub north of Donetsk, and that this attack and the assault on Mariupol were ""revenge"" for deaths in the war in Donetsk.In announcing the start of military operations against Mariupol, Mr. Zakharchenko did not claim responsibility for the rocket attack. Earlier Saturday, a spokesman for the Donetsk People's Republic had denied that rebels were responsible for the strike, which hit near a Ukrainian barracks and also killed one soldier. But Secretary of State John Kerry on Saturday blamed the rebels for the Mariupol attack, condemning the ""horrific assault by Russia-backed separatists,"" and calling on Russia ""to end its support for separatists immediately.""Armed with what appeared to be new tanks and other heavy weapons from Russia, rebels in recent days captured the ruins of the Donetsk airport and their leaders say openly they are now on the march.",1.0
War Is Exploding Anew in Ukraine; Rebels Vow More:   [Foreign Desk ],,"DONETSK, Ukraine -- Unexpectedly, at the height of the Ukrainian winter, war has exploded anew on a half-dozen battered fronts across eastern Ukraine, accompanied by increasing evidence that Russian troops and Russian equipment have been pouring into the region again.A shaky cease-fire has all but vanished, with rebel leaders vowing fresh attacks. Civilians are being hit by deadly mortars at bus stops. Tanks are rumbling down snowy roads in rebel-held areas with soldiers in unmarked green uniforms sitting on their turrets, waving at bystanders -- a disquieting echo of the ""little green men"" whose appearance in Crimea opened this stubborn conflict in the spring.The renewed fighting has dashed any hopes of reinvigorating a cease-fire signed in September and honored more in name than in fact since then. It has also put to rest the notion that Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, would be so staggered by the twin blows of Western sanctions and a collapse in oil prices that he would forsake the separatists in order to foster better relations with the West.Instead, blaming the upsurge in violence on the Ukrainians and the rise in civilian deaths on ""those who issue such criminal orders,"" as he did on Friday in Moscow, Mr. Putin is apparently doubling down, rather than backing down, in a conflict that is now the bloodiest in Europe since the Balkan wars.With the appearance in recent weeks of what NATO calls sophisticated Russian weapons systems, newly emboldened separatist leaders have abandoned all talk of a cease-fire. One of the top leaders of the Russian-backed rebels said Friday that his soldiers were ""on the offensive"" in several sectors, capitalizing on their capture of the Donetsk airport the day before.""We will attack"" until the Ukrainian Army is driven from the border of the Donetsk region, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, leader of the Donetsk People's Republic rebel group, said in comments carried by Russian news agencies.""On our side, we won't make an effort to talk about a cease-fire,"" Mr. Zakharchenko said. ""Now we're going to watch how Kiev reacts. Kiev doesn't understand that we can attack in three directions at once.""For long-suffering residents of Donetsk, who have lived with constant shelling, chronic electricity failures and, since September, a cutoff of pensions and other government support payments from Kiev, the resumption of military action came as little surprise.""It was pure illusion that peace could be achieved now,"" said Enrique Menendez, a former advertising agency owner who now runs a humanitarian relief operation in eastern Ukraine. ""None of the sides has yet achieved its goals. The only real surprise is that the fighting started in the winter instead of the spring.""While the separatist forces now seem ascendant, analysts have little doubt that their fortunes are tied to the level of support provided by Moscow. In August, on the verge of defeat, they were rescued by an all-out Russian incursion that turned the tide on the battlefield and drove Kiev to the bargaining table. The same dynamics appear to be at work now, Ukraine and NATO say, with Russian troops in unmarked uniforms apparently joining the separatists in the assaults on Ukrainian positions.While Moscow denies any role in the fighting, Sergei A. Markov, a political analyst close to the Kremlin, says it is not surprising that Mr. Putin has continued to support the rebellious republics of southeast Ukraine even in the face of economic pressure from the West. In fact, the intensity of the standoff, he said, has undermined the influence of Mr. Putin's liberal economic advisers in government, rendering their voices almost mute in debates over Ukraine.Konstantin Sonin, a professor at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, echoed that point. ""The influence of economists as a whole has completely vanished,"" Mr. Sonin said of the Kremlin. ""The country is on a holy mission. It's at war with the United States, so why would you bother about the small battleground, the economy?""Mr. Putin is said to watch his approval ratings closely, and they have risen to great heights recently with the annexation of Crimea and the tensions with the West over eastern Ukraine. In this respect, said Igor Shuvalov, a first deputy prime minister of Russia, continued fighting in Ukraine may actually help to solidify Mr. Putin politically at a time of deteriorating economic conditions.""When a Russian feels any foreign pressure, he will never give up his leader,"" Mr. Shuvalov said Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""We will survive any hardship in the country, eat less food, use less electricity.""Nevertheless, Mr. Markov said, the stresses of juggling a war and the deepening economic crisis in Russia have left Mr. Putin noticeably preoccupied,""We have much less time than before,"" he said of a recent meeting between experts and Mr. Putin in which he participated. ""It was clear to me that the thoughts of Mr. Putin were somewhere else, but not in our room.""The slow grind of combat in southeastern Ukraine that began in April has now killed at least 5,086 soldiers and civilians, the United Nations reported on Friday. The world body bases its estimate on official morgue and hospital reports, and analysts believe that it understates the total death toll. The report said that 262 of the deaths occurred in the past nine days, making that period the deadliest since the September cease-fire.Signs of the new belligerence were evident across eastern Ukraine on Friday.Indeed, fighting has also flared beyond Donetsk, including a road and rail hub northeast of the city, as well as a strategic checkpoint near Luhansk, the other main rebel stronghold. Rebel commanders claimed on Friday to have captured the village of Krasny Partizan, north of Donetsk, which would be another setback for government forces.In another worrisome sign, the rebels were not the only ones taking a more aggressive tone.Speaking to security officials in Kiev after the loss of Donetsk airport, President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine expressed frustration with the broken peace process.""If the enemy does not want to abide by the cease-fire, if the enemy doesn't want to stop the suffering of innocent people in Ukrainian villages and towns, we will give it to them in the teeth,"" he said.Any major offensive by either side would clearly be a repudiation of the cease-fire signed on Sept. 5 and endorsed by the group's main sponsor, Russia. That agreement, always shaky, began to break down several weeks ago. It had set the de facto borders of the rebel republic to encompass about one-third of the Donetsk region of Ukraine.Mr. Zakharchenko has threatened to expand his territory before, but his warnings have not typically prompted much alarm. Now, with the war raging and his troops on the march, more attention is being paid.As recently as a few weeks ago, peace seemed to be slowly seeping into the blood-soaked fields of eastern Ukraine. Russia seemed occupied with the drop in oil prices and the ruble's collapse. The shaky cease-fire was holding. Language on both sides was noticeably more conciliatory.That all seems a long time ago now on the war-rattled streets of Donetsk, where a main hospital was hit by a shell this week.If one were to ask the remaining residents of Donetsk, even those who have been loyal to the Kiev government, whether they supported this new rebel advance, they would say yes, Mr. Menendez said -- and not necessarily for political reasons.""They just want to push the front lines out of the city,"" he said, ""to stop the shelling on them.""",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; India: Troops and Militants Battle:   [Foreign Desk ],,"NEW DELHI -- A gun battle in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, in an area close to the disputed border with Pakistan, left four militant fighters dead, the Indian Army said on Monday in a statement.Lt. Col. N.N. Joshi, the army spokesman in Srinagar, the state's summer capital, said in a telephone interview that heavily armed men crossed into the area from Pakistan and were intercepted by Indian troops.""Militants were cordoned off in a heavily residential area on Sunday morning,"" Colonel Joshi said, adding that the army and the police evacuated civilians from the area before the battle, which stretched into Monday. Colonel Joshi said the army was still looking for other militants in the area.Indian and Pakistani forces exchanged gunfire at two locations along the border on Sunday and Monday, injuring one Indian border guard on Monday morning, according to Rakesh Sharma, the chief of the Indian Border Security Force in Jammu. The Pakistan Army did not immediately comment on the episode.Militants also set off a grenade near a cellphone tower in Srinagar on Monday, the Indian Army said. The police have reported a series of attacks on targets related to telecommunications in the state over the last 10 days, including cellphone towers and vendors of SIM cards. At least two people have been killed.Abdul Qayoom, the police chief of Sopore, where one of the attacks took place, said that mobile phone networks were being targeted because new restrictions on the sale of SIM cards in the region had made it difficult for militants to get them.""This is sheer frustration of the militants,"" Mr. Qayoom said.India and Pakistan both claim the disputed area of Kashmir, and they have fought three wars over the region, which has been scarred by two decades of armed insurgency.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
North Korea Says It Test-Fired Missile From Submarine:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said Saturday that it had successfully test-fired a ballistic missile from a submarine.Although American officials had suspected North Korea was developing such a missile system, the country had not previously claimed to have conducted a test launching. The test, if confirmed, would pose a new challenge to the United States and its regional allies, South Korea and Japan, which have been trying to build missile defense capabilities to guard against potential North Korean missile attacks. Submarine-launched missiles are harder to detect and intercept.""There took place an underwater test-fire of Korean-style powerful strategic submarine ballistic missile,"" the North's official Korean Central News Agency said Saturday. ""The test-fire proved and confirmed that the ballistic missile fired from the submarine fully met the requirements of the latest military science and technology.""The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, had ordered the development of the new missile system, and he inspected the test, the news agency said. It did not say where and when the test took place.But in another report, the North Korean news agency gave a possible hint of where the launch might have occurred. It reported Saturday that Mr. Kim had visited a fisheries complex in Sinpo, a port on the east coast of North Korea, where American and South Korean analysts have said the North was developing a system for submarine-launched missiles.Last June, North Korea released photos of Mr. Kim looking into a periscope inside a submarine. South Korean officials said they believed that the visit took place in a submarine base on an island off Sinpo. During the visit, Mr. Kim ordered the modernization of his country's submarine fleet, and he told submarine crews to prepare to fight in waters far away from their homeland, North Korean state news media said at the time.Mr. Kim called the test ""an eye-opening success as signal as satellite launch,"" comparing it to the North's successful launching of a long-range rocket to put a satellite into orbit in December 2012. American officials believe that the satellite launching was part of North Korea's efforts to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to targets as far away as the United States mainland.The Saturday edition of the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the North's ruling Workers' Party, carried photos of Mr. Kim watching a white missile blast out of the water and soar into the sky.In a separate Korean-language version of its article, the Central News Agency quoted Mr. Kim as saying that once his country entered a ""systematized production"" of new submarine missiles and deployed them ""in the near future,"" it would ""make our enemies lose sleep because they are like time bombs that can go off any time on their back.""There was no immediate reaction from the South Korean Defense Ministry.The news of a successful test-fire was most likely a surprise to South Korean military officials, who have privately told reporters that they believed it would take years for the North to develop such a submarine-launched ballistic missile. But warnings have increased in recent months as analysts detected what appeared to be the land-based tests of a submarine ejector launcher using vertical launch tubes, all conducted in Sinpo.A submarine-launched ballistic missile adds to the range, secrecy and flexibility with which North Korea could threaten the United States, South Korea and Japan.""North Korea's development of a submarine-launched missile capability would eventually expand Pyongyang's threat to South Korea, Japan and U.S. bases in East Asia, also complicating regional missile defense planning, deployment and operations,"" Joseph S. Bermudez Jr., an expert on the North Korean military, said in an article posted on the website 38North in January. ""Submarines carrying land-attack missiles would be challenging to locate and track, would be mobile assets able to attack from any direction, and could operate at significant distances from the Korean peninsula.""",1.0
U.S. Commandos Kill an ISIS Leader in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- American Special Operations forces mounted a rare raid into eastern Syria early Saturday, killing a leader of the Islamic State and about a dozen militant fighters, as well as capturing his wife and freeing an 18-year-old Yazidi woman whom Pentagon officials said had been held as a slave.In the first successful raid by American ground troops since the military campaign against the Islamic State began last year, two dozen Delta Force commandos entered Syria aboard Black Hawk helicopters and V-22 Ospreys and killed the leader, a man known as Abu Sayyaf. One American military official described him as the Islamic State's ""emir of oil and gas.""Even so, Abu Sayyaf is a midlevel leader in the organization -- one terrorism analyst compared him to Al Capone's accountant -- and likely is replaceable in fairly short order. And the operation, while successful, comes as the Islamic State has been advancing in the Iraqi city of Ramadi, demonstrating that the fight against the Sunni militant group in both Iraq and Syria remains very fluid.Yet the Pentagon's description of a nighttime raid that found its intended target deep inside Syria without any American troops being wounded or killed illustrates not only the effectiveness of the Delta Force, but of improving American intelligence on shadowy Islamic State leaders.A Defense Department official said Islamic State fighters who defended their building and Abu Sayyaf tried to use women and children as shields, but that the Delta Force commandos ""used very precise fire"" and ""separated the women and children."" The official said the operation involved close ""hand-to-hand fighting."" (The accounts of the raid came from military and government officials and could not be immediately verified through independent sources.)The American forces eventually entered the building where they found Abu Sayyaf and his wife, known as Umm Sayyaf, in a room together. His spouse was captured and later moved to a military facility in Iraq, officials said.The raid came after weeks of surveillance of Abu Sayyaf, using information gleaned from a small but growing network of informants whom the C.I.A. and the Pentagon have painstakingly developed in Syria, as well as satellite imagery, drone reconnaissance and electronic eavesdropping, American officials said. The White House rejected initial reports from the region that attributed the raid to the forces of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.""The U.S. government did not coordinate with the Syrian regime, nor did we advise them in advance of this operation,"" said Bernadette Meehan, the National Security Council spokeswoman. ""We have warned the Assad regime not to interfere with our ongoing efforts against ISIL inside of Syria,"" she added, using another name for the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS.In a statement early Saturday, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said the killing of Abu Sayyaf dealt a ""significant blow"" to the group. The militant leader was said to be involved in the Islamic State's military operations and helped direct its ""illicit oil, gas and financial operations"" that raised the funds necessary for the organization to operate. Officials said the raid was approved by President Obama.Defense Department officials said the Delta Force soldiers carrying out the raid came under fire soon after they landed near a building used by Abu Sayyaf as his residence, in Amr, about 20 miles southeast of Deir al-Zour, near the oil facilities that he oversaw for the Islamic State.The commandos had left Iraq aboard the aircraft, and were soon on the ground in Amr, a Defense Department official said. They came under fire, the official said, and fired back, killing around a dozen Islamic State fighters.""The objective was the building, a multistory building,"" the official said. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.Abu Sayyaf ""tried to engage"" the commandos, the Defense Department official said, and was shot and killed. The commandos took his wife and the Yazidi woman back to the waiting American aircraft, which, by then, had sustained a number of bullet holes from the firefight with the Islamic State fighters.Defense Department officials said only Islamic State fighters had been killed in the mission, and that they had received no reports of civilian casualties. But officials acknowledged that they were still gathering information on the raid.The commandos were back in Iraq with the two women around dawn local time, officials said. They said the American forces were able to seize laptop computers, cellphones and other materials from the site, which may prove useful in intelligence assessments.The Yazidi woman, Mr. Carter said, will be reunited with her family as soon as possible. It was unclear on Saturday what would be done with Umm Sayyaf, who, according to Mr. Carter's statement, is suspected of playing an important role in the group's activities and ""may have been complicit in what appears to have been the enslavement"" of the Yazidi woman.The Yazidis are a religious minority persecuted by the Islamic State.American interrogators will question Umm Sayyaf about the organization and its operations, but given that she is an Iraqi citizen, authorities there are also likely to seek custody of her, a senior American official said.Had Abu Sayyaf been captured alive, the official said, the plan was to interrogate him in Iraq and then send him to the United States for criminal prosecution if authorities believed they could build a strong case against him. David Thomson, an analyst and author of the book ""The French Jihadists,"" said by email that he had confirmed with sources inside the Islamic State that Abu Sayyaf was a Tunisian emir who had traveled to Iraq as far back as 2003. As a member of the first wave of jihadists who arrived in Iraq more than a decade ago, he and his Tunisian colleagues were called ""Al Iraqi,"" creating confusion over his nationality.The operation came just months after three unsuccessful raids by American commandos in Syria and Yemen to free American hostages.In the first one, in Syria last summer, two dozen Delta Force commandos raided an oil refinery in the northern part of the country as part of the effort to free James Foley, an American journalist, but found after a firefight that there were no hostages to be saved.Mr. Foley was later beheaded by the Islamic State.In the second, on Nov. 25, American Special Operations forces entered a cave near Yemen's border with Saudi Arabia in an effort to free Luke Somers, an American photojournalist. But he was not there; the forces freed eight other hostages and killed seven militants.A few days later, in December, American forces mounted another attempt to free Mr. Somers, storming a village in southern Yemen, but that raid ended in tragedy with the kidnappers killing Mr. Somers and a South African held with him.Saturday's raid into Syria represents an important threshold for the administration in showing that it will continue to send American ground troops into conflicts outside major war zones -- as it has in Yemen, Somalia and Libya -- to capture or kill suspected terrorists.Although Abu Sayyaf himself was not a well-known figure, he was important as much for who and what he knew about the Islamic State's hierarchy and operations, as for his actual job.""He managed the oil infrastructure and financial generation details for ISIL,"" the senior United States official said. ""Given that job, he was pretty well-connected.""Bruce O. Riedel, a former C.I.A. analyst now at the Brookings Institution, said the operation looked like ""a collection mission, the goal to capture someone or two someones who can explain how ISIS works."" With Abu Sayyaf now dead, he said, ""perhaps the wife can do that.""But, he added, ""To me, it demonstrates we still have large gaps in our understanding of the enemy and how it is organized.""",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; North Korea: Shells Fired During Drills:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea fired dozens of artillery shells into waters near the disputed western sea border with South Korea on Wednesday, the South Korean military said.Earlier Wednesday, North Korea told South Korea that it would conduct artillery drills this week near their sea border, where the two countries have fought naval skirmishes in recent years, the South said. On Wednesday night, North Korean naval guns and coastline artillery fired 130 shells, but none of them crossed the disputed maritime border, the South Korean military's Office of Joint Chiefs of Staff said.The North Korean drill comes at a time when tensions have appeared to rise along the so-called Northern Limit Line, a western maritime border that South Korea has patrolled since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. The North does not recognize the border and insists upon a demarcation line that lies south of the Northern Limit Line, encroaching deeply into waters controlled by the South.This month, North Korea threatened to fire upon any South Korean patrol boats crossing the border line it favored. On Tuesday, President Park Geun-hye of South Korea warned that her military would deal ""decisively"" with such provocations.On Wednesday, the North Korean military sent a telephone message telling its South Korean counterpart that it would conduct maritime artillery exercises in waters north of the Northern Limit Line between 3 p.m. Wednesday and midnight Friday, the Office of Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.""This is an act of raising tensions,"" the statement said, warning that if the North intruded into the South's waters, ""we will react strongly.""North Korea has occasionally conducted artillery drills in waters near the Northern Limit Line, and some of its shells have fallen south of the line. When that happens, South Korea retaliates by pounding North Korean waters with its own artillery shells.Armed standoffs along the western sea border are not unusual. The South has often accused the North of sending navy boats across the Northern Limit Line to highlight its claim to waters south of the line.When such incursions have taken place, patrol boats from both sides have sometimes exchanged warning shots. But they also resulted in bloody skirmishes between the rival navies in 1999, 2002 and 2009. And in 2010, the North was accused of torpedoing a South Korean Navy ship in the disputed waters and also attacked one of the South Korean islands there with artillery. Fifty South Koreans were killed in the two attacks.The North Korean notice on Wednesday came on the same day that the South Korean intelligence agency told lawmakers that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, had recently executed Gen. Hyon Yong-chol, the head of his defense ministry, for disloyalty.General Hyon was the most senior North Korean official purged since the execution of an uncle of Mr. Kim's, Jang Song-thaek, in 2013.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
"No. 2 Leader of ISIS Is Killed in U.S.-Led Strike, Iraq Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BAGHDAD -- The Iraqi government said Wednesday that the second-in-command of the Islamic State had been killed in an airstrike carried out by the American-led coalition in northern Iraq, a claim American officials said they could not confirm.Iraq's Ministry of Defense said that the militant leader, known as Abu Alaa al-Afari, was killed in a strike near the northern city Tal Afar. The United States Central Command acknowledged that airstrikes were conducted against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, near Tal Afar on Tuesday and Wednesday, but it could not verify the government's claim.In a statement on its website, the Defense Ministry said that, ""based on accurate intelligence,"" a coalition airstrike had targeted Mr. Afari and several other leaders who had gathered in a mosque. Iraqi state television broadcast an aerial video of a building being blown up that it said showed the strike that had killed Mr. Afari.But it was unclear from the video whether the building was a mosque, and a spokesman for Central Command, Maj. Curtis J. Kellogg, denied that the airstrikes had been conducted against any mosque.In Washington, a senior Defense Department official said that no coalition airstrikes were specifically targeting Mr. Afari. ""We were not targeting ISIS' No. 2 guy,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified targeting information. ""If we got lucky, then I guess we'll see.""The death of Mr. Afari would represent a serious blow to the leadership of the Islamic State. But Iraqi officials have frequently made claims about the deaths of terrorist leaders that later turned out to be untrue.A previous leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, the predecessor to the Islamic State, was claimed to have been killed several times, and his supposed death became a running joke in the Iraqi media. The death of another well-known Islamic State militant, an Iraqi named Shaker Waheeb, has on several occasions been reported by Iraqi officials, and each time he has emerged alive.Mr. Afari, who also goes by several other assumed names, was recently added to a United States government list offering rewards for information leading to the death or capture of Islamic State leaders. The list, which identified Mr. Afari as Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli and said he had been a top deputy to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the former leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, offered a $7 million bounty for Mr. Afari.Mr. Afari is said to be the deputy to the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who himself has been the subject of rumors that he was wounded in an airstrike in March. On Wednesday, Gen. Tahseen Ibrahim, the spokesman for Iraq's Ministry of Defense, said that the best intelligence he had seen suggested that Mr. Baghdadi had, indeed, been wounded, but was still in charge of the organization.",1.0
A Raid on ISIS Yields a Trove of Intelligence:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- American intelligence agencies have extracted valuable information about the Islamic State's leadership structure, financial operations and security measures by analyzing materials seized during a Delta Force commando raid last month that killed a leader of the terrorist group in eastern Syria, according to United States officials.The information harvested from the laptops, cellphones and other materials recovered from the raid on May 16 has already helped the United States identify, locate and carry out an airstrike against another Islamic State leader in eastern Syria, on May 31. American officials expressed confidence that an influential lieutenant, Abu Hamid, was killed in the attack, but the Islamic State, which remains resilient, has not yet confirmed his death.New insights yielded by the seized trove -- four to seven terabytes of data, according to one official -- include how the organization's shadowy leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, operates and tries to avoid being tracked by coalition forces.Mr. Baghdadi meets periodically with regional emirs, or leaders, at his headquarters in Raqqa in eastern Syria. To ensure his safety, specially entrusted drivers pick up each of the emirs and demand that they hand over their cellphones and any other electronic devices to avoid inadvertently disclosing their location through tracking by American intelligence, the officials said.Wives of the top Islamic State leaders, including Mr. Baghdadi's, play a more important role than previously known, passing information to one another, and then to their spouses, in an effort to avoid electronic intercepts.""I'll just say from that raid we're learning quite a bit that we did not know before,"" a senior State Department official told reporters in a telephone briefing last week. ""Every single day the picture becomes clearer of what this organization is, how sophisticated it is, how global it is and how networked it is.""But the allied effort to defeat the organization still faces daunting challenges. With thousands of Islamist militant fighters in Syria and Iraq seizing new territory faster than the international coalition arrayed against them can push them back, a meeting in Paris by coalition members last Tuesday seemed unlikely to reverse the momentum anytime soon.The group of 24 ministers did not embrace any major changes and appeared set to continue on its present course, even though over the past few weeks Syria's government lost control of the strategically important city of Palmyra and the Iraqi government lost control of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province, to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh, its Arabic acronym.And American counterterrorism officials acknowledge that questions remained about how effectively even this trove of materials can be exploited, given the nature of the Islamic State's secrecy and ability to adapt.""Daesh remains extremely resilient, ruthless, and capable of taking the initiative,"" Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the conference.The raid on the multistory residence of Abu Sayyaf, described by American officials as the group's top financial officer, illustrates that American intelligence on Islamic State leaders is improving. At least one informant deep inside the group played a crucial role in helping track Abu Sayyaf, said a senior military official who was briefed on plans for the raid.Abu Sayyaf's wife, Umm Sayyaf, who was captured in the operation, has also provided information to investigators, one senior American official said.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said last month that the killing of Abu Sayyaf dealt a ""significant blow"" to the group. The militant leader was said to be involved in the Islamic State's kidnap-for-ransom activities and helped direct its oil, gas and financial operations that raised the funds necessary for the organization to operate.Since the raid, senior administration officials and top military officers have dropped only broad hints about the value of the materials that were scooped up in the predawn operation, which was carried out after weeks of surveillance from satellite imagery, drone reconnaissance and electronic eavesdropping, American officials said.""In the recent raid on Abu Sayyaf, we collected substantial information on Daesh financial operations,"" John R. Allen, the retired general who now serves as the diplomatic envoy coordinating the coalition against the Islamic State, told a conference in Qatar on Wednesday. ""And we're gaining a much clearer understanding of Daesh's organization and business enterprise.""At the Pentagon on Friday, Lt. Gen. John Hesterman III, the top allied air commander, told reporters by phone from his headquarters in Qatar that ""there is a whole bunch of targeting that is opening up here, as we gain and learn more about this enemy."" He did not specifically refer to the raid.Against this backdrop, five senior American officials provided additional details about the materials recovered from the house of Abu Sayyaf, a nom de guerre for a Tunisian militant whom American authorities have since identified as Fathi ben Awn ben Jildi Murad al-Tunisi. But these officials did so only on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence assessments.These officials described details they said would not necessarily provide any advantage to the Islamic State, and might even sow fear in their ranks that the United States and its allies were beginning to crack their shield of secrecy.Over the past decade in Iraq and Afghanistan, the American military and intelligence agencies have developed vast expertise in analyzing materials seized in commando raids, sometimes quickly enough to generate new raids within a matter of hours.""We've gotten very good at document exploitation,"" said Matthew Levitt, a former Treasury Department official who is director of the Stein Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""Once they grab a computer and comb the drives, this moves very quickly.""Within two weeks of the raid, American officials were able to use information gathered from the materials to attack Abu Hamid in the vicinity of Ash Shaddadi, near Hasakah in northeast Syria. American officials described him as the emir of Shariah and tribal affairs.The materials also revealed new details about how the Islamic State has allocated revenue from oil production. About half goes to the group's general operating budget; the remainder is split roughly between maintaining the oil-field production facilities and for salaries to the workers, American officials said.These workers, once thought possibly to be conscripted locals, are now believed to be salaried Islamic State employees, thus making them legitimate targets, officials said.American counterterrorism analysts have learned new information about the Islamic State's hierarchy. One leader, Fadel al-Hayali, also known as Abu Mu'taz, who had been believed to be the head of the Islamic State's military council, appears to have played an even more important role than previously known.Abu Mu'taz, a former lieutenant colonel in the Iraqi military intelligence agency of President Saddam Hussein, led the council of six to nine military commanders who directed the Islamic State's military strategy, according to Laith Alkhouri, a senior analyst at Flashpoint Global Partners, a security consulting firm that tracks militant websites.The military council has a subgroup known as the Security Council, which is in charge of leading Islamic State assassinations, kidnappings, interrogations and other attacks, Mr. Alkhouri said. There were reports in November 2014 and again in February that Abu Mu'taz died in coalition airstrikes but the Islamic State never put out a confirmation, he said.Although Abu Sayyaf himself was not well known, he was important as much for who and what he knew about the Islamic State's hierarchy and operations as for his actual job, American officials and independent analysts said.""Considering Abu Sayyaf's role, he presumably would have been familiar, and in contact, with Abu Mu'taz, possibly as the point of contact to the central leadership,"" Mr. Alkhouri said. ""Abu Sayyaf's role as financing man is important because he managed large amounts of money; funds that the central leadership would want to keep tabs on.""Photograph In an Image Taken From a Video On a Militant Website, the Islamic State's Leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, Last Year in Mosul, Iraq.

Yemen: Military Headquarters Bombed,,"Saudi-led airstrikes before dawn Sunday struck the headquarters of Yemen's armed forces in Sana, the rebel-held capital, killing at least 22 people, officials said. Most of the dead were soldiers, they said, and the airstrikes damaged several nearby homes. Residents said at least three airstrikes hit the headquarters, a short distance from the city's center. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to journalists. The Saudi-led coalition began airstrikes in March against the Yemeni rebels known as Houthis and their allies in the military and security forces. The Houthis seized Sana in September and later captured much of northern Yemen before moving south in March. Their southern advance forced the internationally recognized president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, to flee to Saudi Arabia.",1.0
Saudi Arabia Downs Missile Fired From Yemen:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- Saudi Arabia shot down a Scud ballistic missile fired from Yemen early Saturday by forces loyal to Yemen's Houthi rebels, according to a statement by the official Saudi news agency. It was the first time Yemeni factions had used the weapon, signaling an escalation of the conflict and providing new evidence that a Saudi effort to pacify the rebels is faltering.The missile was fired from northern Yemen toward the city of Khamis Mushayt, in southwestern Saudi Arabia, and was intercepted by two Saudi Patriot missiles, the statement said. The city is near a Saudi Air Force base.Saudi Arabia and forces loyal to the Houthis have traded sporadic fire across the border since late March, when an Arab coalition led by the Saudis began a military offensive to force the Houthis to retreat from Sana, the capital, and other cities in Yemen. The Scud launching, confirmed in a statement by Houthi news outlets, was part of a pattern of escalating violence across the frontier in recent weeks that has raised fears that the war is expanding, even as diplomats intensify their efforts to convene negotiations between the combatants.The Saudi Press Agency said that the firing of the missile on Saturday was part of a broader, failed offensive on the border carried out by troops allied with the Houthis. It came a day after Saudi airstrikes in northern Yemen killed at least 50 people, according to Yemeni health officials.The sudden appearance of the Scuds undermined repeated claims by the Saudis that they had destroyed the Houthis' stocks of heavy and ballistic weapons with hundreds of airstrikes targeting military bases and weapons stores. And it raised new questions about the effectiveness of the open-ended Saudi offensive, which has failed to achieve its stated goals over the course of a war that has killed more than 2,000 people.Scores of deaths have occurred during airstrikes on arms stores in Sana, with secondary explosions sending shrapnel hurtling through residential areas.It was not clear how many of the missiles remained in the possession of the Houthis, who are allied with well-armed military units loyal to Yemen's former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. Mr. Saleh's forces publicly received at least one shipment of Scud missiles from North Korea in 2002.The United States, which had seized the shipment of 15 disassembled and concealed missiles, eventually allowed the weapons to pass after Mr. Saleh, whom the Bush administration considered an ally in the fight against terrorism, promised they would be used for defensive purposes.Saudi officials said Saturday that after downing the Scud, warplanes were able to locate and destroy the missile launcher.",1.0
Israel: Rockets From Syria Hit Golan:   [Foreign Desk ],,"JERUSALEM -- At least two rockets fired from Syria struck the Israeli-controlled portion of the Golan Heights on Tuesday and Israel responded with artillery toward the suspected launching sites in Syria, according to the Israeli military. The exchange added to already heightened tensions along a once-quiet frontier that has been increasingly destabilized by the Syrian civil war.No casualties were reported on the Israeli side, where sirens warned of the incoming rockets, which fell on open ground. The military ordered the evacuation and closure of the ski slopes of the Mount Hermon resort and the police briefly closed some roads in the area. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition monitoring group, said Israel had bombed bases of the Syrian Army. There was no immediate information about casualties on the Syrian side.The rocket attack came nine days after a deadly airstrike on a convoy in the Syrian portion of the Golan Heights that was attributed to Israel. The airstrike killed five fighters from the Lebanese Hezbollah organization, including the son of the group's slain military commander, Imad Mughniyeh, as well as an Iranian general.That rare, direct confrontation between Israel and its enemies on Syrian soil immediately raised the stakes along the decades-old cease-fire line between Israel and Syria. It put the Israeli Army on high alert in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, and along the border with Lebanon. A top Iranian commander had threatened retaliation and warned Israel to prepare for a ""shattering thunderbolt.""Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli military, said Tuesday's rocket fire appeared to have been intentionally directed into Israeli-held territory, but said that the military authorities could not determine whether it was meant as revenge.There have been several exchanges of fire across the 1974 cease-fire line in recent months and years that were considered spillover from the Syrian civil war, with Israel saying it was responding to mortar shells fired either errantly or intentionally into Israeli-controlled territory.Israel has declared a policy of neutrality regarding the struggle between the government of President Bashar al-Assad and the rebels, but at the same time it has been carrying out a covert campaign to prevent the transfer of sophisticated weapons from Syria to Hezbollah, the militant Lebanese Shiite organization.Israel and Hezbollah engaged in a monthlong war in 2006. Hezbollah is now fighting in Syria on the side of the Assad government.Further complicating the situation, much of the Syrian side of the frontier in the Golan Heights is under the control of rebel groups fighting the Assad government, including radical jihadist forces.Israel has bombed Syrian territory several times, targeting weapons storehouses and convoys said to be bound for Hezbollah, without provoking retaliation from the group. But the airstrike this month that killed the Hezbollah fighters and the Iranian general has increased the risk of entanglement.Israeli officials have remained silent about the airstrike, maintaining a policy of ambiguity in such cases meant in part to stave off retaliation. Israeli military commentators who appeared to have been briefed by officials said that Hezbollah and Iran were jointly building an infrastructure in the Syrian Golan Heights for attacks against Israeli forces and communities in the region.About 20,000 Syrian citizens of the Druse religious sect live in several villages in the Israeli-held portion of Golan, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 war and later effectively annexed in a move that has not been internationally recognized. The wild and rocky terrain is also home to about 20,000 Israeli Jews in more than 30 settlements.On Tuesday, before the rockets fell, about 1,000 visitors had entered the small Israeli ski resort at Mount Hermon. Tamar Durst, who had brought her son to ski there as a birthday surprise, said she heard an announcement instructing all civilians to evacuate the area, but there was no panic. ""The evacuation was orderly, the order was exemplary,"" she told Israel Radio. ""Everyone was very disciplined and returned the equipment,"" she added.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
"U.S. Drone Kills 3 Qaeda Operatives in Yemen, Continuing Policy on Strikes:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- A C.I.A. drone strike in Yemen, the first since the resignation of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, killed three suspected Qaeda fighters on Monday, American officials said, in a signal that the United States will continue its counterterrorism operations there despite the apparent takeover by Houthi fighters.A missile launched from a drone struck a car in which the three men were riding in the central province of Marib, near the border with the province of Shabwa, which is believed to be a Qaeda stronghold. The C.I.A. operates a drone base in southern Saudi Arabia.A senior American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, declined to confirm the names of the victims. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment.But a member of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula identified the men killed as Awaid al-Rashidi, a Saudi citizen in his early 30s who spent years in a Saudi prison before he was released and joined Al Qaeda in Yemen; Abdullah Khaled al-Zindani, a Yemeni citizen from Sana, who with Mr. Rashidi was said to be engaged in anti-Houthi activities; and Mohammed Toiman al-Jahmi, a Yemeni teenager whose father and brother were previously killed in American drone strikes. The Qaeda member did not know Mr. Jahmi's age but said he was a member of the terrorist group.The strike is the latest episode in the chaos that has engulfed Yemen for months, pitting Mr. Hadi against the Iranian-backed Houthis. Mr. Hadi resigned last week after the Houthis lay siege to the capital, demanding greater political influence for their minority group than Mr. Hadi was willing to allow.Mr. Hadi's resignation raised questions about whether American counterterrorism efforts in Yemen could continue, but the Houthis also oppose Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, leading some American officials to speculate privately that the Houthi takeover may not necessarily signal the end of American efforts.Monday's strike was a clear demonstration that American counterterrorism efforts had not abated. At a news conference in New Delhi on Sunday, President Obama said that his administration would ""continue to go after high-value targets inside of Yemen"" and would ""continue to maintain the pressure that's required to keep the American people safe."" Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, on Monday echoed the president, responding to reports that the fall of the Yemen's United States-backed government had led to a suspension of American operations there. ""We will continue to hunt A.Q.A.P. wherever they are,"" Colonel Warren said.There was no official reaction from the Houthis to the American strike, but one member of the movement, who is close to the leaders of the group, said, ""We are against any American plane penetrating our airspace.""He added: ""But they killed militants who were probably planning an attack against us in Marib."" He did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.The turmoil in Yemen comes at a particularly fraught time, just two weeks after A.Q.A.P. claimed responsibility for the deadly attacks in Paris on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The French attacks have raised the level of concern about the group, and American officials say they are worried the group could exploit the power vacuum in Yemen.There are also rising fears that the current political standoff could lead to the partition of Yemen. Alarmed by the Houthis' expansion, the southern separatist movement, Heraq, has been seizing territory, and some tribes are now more open to working with Al Qaeda, giving the group a larger pool from which to recruit.""Al Qaeda in Yemen tried to strike a deal with tribes in many places before, but they failed,"" said Jamal Benomar, the United Nations envoy to Yemen. ""Now, some tribes are fighting along with them.""",1.0
Ukrainian Forces Struggle as Fighting Flares in East:   [Foreign Desk ],,"DONETSK, Ukraine -- The shattered remains of a tank bearing a tattered Ukrainian flag sat beside the main highway to Mariupol on Monday afternoon, a remnant of what pro-Russian rebel forces said was a failed attempt by Ukrainian forces to push into rebel-held territory a few days after a shelling attack left 30 dead in that port city.With a cease-fire in shreds, pro-Russian separatist forces mounting regular new attacks and the Ukrainian military struggling to rebound from losses at the Donetsk airport last week, eastern Ukraine is seeing by far the heaviest fighting since August. Thunderous artillery blasts could be heard from several directions Monday in the largely isolated city of Donetsk.The Ukrainian government declared a state of emergency in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the areas controlled by the rebels, and put the entire country on high alert. In Brussels, at the request of the Ukrainian government, the ambassadors from 28 NATO nations were set to meet on Monday to discuss the situation, the first such gathering since August.Separatist leaders have said they had no choice last week but to end the shaky cease-fire, which had been in effect since September, and begin offensives to push back Ukrainian forces attacking rebel-held cities.Ukrainian military officials said the rebel attacks followed a prolonged buildup of heavy weaponry and troops from Russia, something the Kremlin vociferously denies. However, Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, had some harsh words for the Ukrainian military, which he derided as a tool of the West.On a visit to St. Petersburg, Russia, he said that men were fleeing to Russia rather than become ""cannon fodder"" in Ukraine's military. ""In essence, this is not an army,"" he said. ""This is a foreign legion -- in this particular case NATO's foreign legion, which of course does not pursue the objective of serving Ukraine's national interests.""Ukrainian officials said that seven of their soldiers had been killed and at least two dozen were wounded in Monday's fighting. There were reports of some deaths and many casualties in rebel-held regions, but officials there offered no estimates. In all, United Nations human rights officials have said, more than 5,000 people have been killed since fighting started in eastern Ukraine early last year.Also on Monday, the United Nations humanitarian agency said the Ukrainian government had imposed new restrictions last week on aid agencies seeking to deliver assistance to areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists and, as Jeffrey Feltman, the undersecretary general for political affairs, put it: ""both sides"" had hindered access.According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, more than 900,000 Ukrainians are displaced from their homes, and another 600,000 have fled to other countries since the conflict began last March.Residents reached by phone in Dokuchaevsk, a town a few miles south of that shattered tank, said that shelling had hammered the town all night Sunday and much of the day Monday. ""No shops were open today and no businesses,"" said an elderly woman who declined to give her name for fear of reprisals, adding that she and most residents were hiding in basements.North of the Donetsk airport, around the villages of Peski and Avdeyevka, heavy shelling also could be heard much of the day Monday. Rebel forces in the area have vowed to encircle hundreds of Ukrainian troops camped near the crucial railroad town of Debaltseve, and those villages could be crucial in that effort.The main access routes out of Donetsk -- to the south, toward Mariupol, and to the west, toward Kurakhovo -- were closed to all traffic for most of Monday because of nearby shelling. This came just a few days after Ukraine instituted the regulations making it more difficult to get in and out of the city and further added to the growing sense of isolation in the rebel enclave.At least some shells had also fallen inside Donetsk. At the Central Trauma Hospital, doctors said on Monday that a 9-month-old child and her mother were wounded and the grandmother killed when a shell hit their home.The screaming baby had been taken away to another part of the hospital to be calmed as the mother was wheeled into surgery Monday afternoon, while the grandmother's body lay beneath a tattered blue blanket just outside in the hallway.",1.0
Ukraine Accuses Russia of Sending More Troops and Artillery to Aid Rebels:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- In as clear a sign as any of the unraveling peace process in eastern Ukraine, the authorities in Kiev accused Russia on Monday of again sending regular army soldiers into Ukraine to prop up pro-Russian separatists who were losing a battle.About 700 soldiers crossed Russia's western border into the snowy war zone in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council said in a statement that was not possible to verify independently.They came armed with a wide array of heavy weapons, Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk told journalists in Kiev, the capital. The country's intelligence agencies ""confirm that men and equipment entered from Russia,"" he said. Howitzers and other artillery and antiaircraft systems were said to have crossed the border.""These items cannot be bought in a market in Donetsk or the Russian Federation,"" Mr. Yatsenyuk said. ""They can only come from the stock of the Russian Defense Ministry.""The accusation followed a weekend of escalating and bloody mayhem alarming even by the standards of eastern Ukraine.After first being partly pushed from the ruins of the main terminal of the Donetsk airport last week, the Ukrainian military counterattacked with tanks over the weekend and claimed to have recaptured all the lost ground.At least four Ukrainian soldiers were killed and scores wounded in the fighting, and human rights groups in Donetsk were investigating reports that up to 10 civilians had been killed by stray shells.Beyond the immediate conflict zone, an explosion outside a courthouse in Kharkiv, another eastern city, wounded 12 people in the latest in a string of politically hued bombings and assassinations in eastern Ukraine that the authorities have labeled terrorist acts.Bombs have detonated in centers where volunteers collect goods for the army, in bars frequented by activists who support Ukraine's government and outside hospitals treating wounded soldiers.On Sunday, an unexplained explosion destroyed nine parked cars in a district of Kiev.Russia's Foreign Ministry accused Ukraine on Monday of making a disingenuous offer to reinstate the cease-fire negotiated on Sept. 5. The ministry said the authorities in Kiev had first ignored peace overtures in a letter from President Vladimir V. Putin that was sent late last week. Ukraine's president, Petro O. Poroshenko, proposed an immediate recommitment to a cease-fire in the east. ""Ukraine is ready to sign a cease-fire agreement if the sides stick to the Minsk accords,"" he said, referring to the talks in Belarus that led to the cease-fire. ""Ukraine wants peace.""Both sides in the conflict concede that what they are now fighting over is chiefly a symbol, and a battered, ugly one at that: the ruins of the airport.For the Ukrainians, the airport forms the army's toehold in the rebel capital city, Donetsk, illustrating to residents there that a breakaway region will never really be viable or independent.For Russia, the continual rebel efforts to seize the ruins achieve substantially the same goal: highlighting the perpetual state of insecurity Ukraine will live in, so long as Russia's interests are not reckoned with. Russia's Foreign Ministry issued a statement over the weekend saying Ukraine should voluntarily hand over the airport to separatist control.European foreign ministers meeting Monday opted to keep economic sanctions against Russia in place, despite suggestions in an internal European Union policy document leaked last week that European nations should seek to revive some cooperation with Russia.Fighters with the Donetsk People's Republic, one of the separatist forces, seized control of the airport's runway and taxiways last week, according to Ukrainian accounts, while the terminal buildings were the setting of bitter, close combat. Pro-Russian groups controlled the second floor and above in the main terminal building, while the Ukrainian forces held lower floors and access tunnels. Stairwells and even holes in the floors became front lines.In the tank assault on Sunday, Ukraine's army claimed to have expelled the separatists from the runway, allowing the army to move new forces into the terminal and evacuate casualties.That success soon led to a reversal. Ukrainian and separatist authorities both reported Monday that the separatists had collapsed the second floor in an explosion, wounding or killing an unknown number of Ukrainians below.Yuri Biryukov, an adviser to Mr. Poroshenko, wrote on Facebook that ""the debris fell on the fighters"" and that ""there are many wounded.""Despite the Ukrainian claims, there was no indication on Monday that newly arrived Russian forces were involved in the battle for the airport.Photograph A Separatist Soldier Inspected the Damage to a Hospital in Donetsk, Ukraine, On Monday After It Had Been Hit by Artillery Fire.

Hezbollah Says Israeli Helicopter Strike Killed Five Fighters in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- An Israeli helicopter strike in Syria killed five Hezbollah fighters on Sunday, including the son of the group's slain military commander, Imad Mughniyeh, Hezbollah said as a member briefed on the episode described the attack as a provocative move by Israel.The attack threatened to rekindle fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group and political party. Tensions between the two set off a deadly war in 2006 but have, in recent years, taken a back seat to the civil war in neighboring Syria, where Hezbollah is fighting to prevent the overthrow of a crucial ally, President Bashar al-Assad.During nearly four years of war there, Israel has bombed Syrian territory several times, targeting weapons storehouses and convoys said to be bound for Hezbollah, without provoking retaliation from the group. But with a direct strike on Hezbollah fighters on the ground in Syria, the Hezbollah member said, ""They are trying to modify the rules of engagement, and Hezbollah will never allow that.""The attack, targeting two vehicles traveling in the Syrian portion of the Golan Heights, came days after Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said Israeli strikes in Syria constituted serious aggression and that Syria and its allies had a right to respond.The Hezbollah member, who was not authorized to make an official statement, said the strike drew intense interest because among those killed was Jihad Imad Mughniyeh, 25, whose father was assassinated in 2008 in Syria, presumably by Israel. Israeli officials refused to comment, maintaining their usual policy of ambiguity regarding attacks on Syrian turf, intended to stave off retaliation by allowing adversaries to save face.Agence France-Presse, however, cited an unidentified Israeli security source who said that an Israeli helicopter carried out the strike against ""terrorists"" in the Syrian sector of the Golan Heights, saying they were preparing an attack against Israel.Citing unnamed Western intelligence sources, two Israeli news outlets, Haaretz and Ynet, said the younger Mr. Mughniyeh headed a militant network that had already operated against Israel in the Golan Heights and that Mr. Mughniyeh was planning attacks aimed at killing Israeli soldiers and civilians.The Hezbollah member said Mr. Mughniyeh was a rank-and-file fighter whose importance was mainly symbolic.Israel's strike on Hezbollah fighters in Syria, or any attempt by those fighters to target Israel, would be a shift from the two enemies' tacit agreement not to escalate tensions with each other at a time when each has other security concerns. Southern Syria is a complicated, volatile battleground, an unpredictable mix of alliances, where Qaeda-affiliated fighters operate within sight of Israel without attacking it, choosing instead to battle Hezbollah.Western-backed insurgents, whose fighters have been allowed into Israel-controlled territory for treatment, sometimes coordinate with the Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Nusra's recent advances in the area have alarmed Hezbollah because Nusra has carried out attacks on Hezbollah's Shiite supporters in Lebanon.Syria's information minister, Omran al-Zoubi, said Sunday's attack proved Israel was cooperating with Nusra, which the United States lists as a terrorist group.Moshe Yaalon, Israel's defense minister, declined to comment on the strike, but told an Israeli radio station that considering Mr. Nasrallah had recently denied the group's presence in the Golan Heights, ""he has some explaining to do.""With Hezbollah devoting significant resources to Syria, Israeli strategists may believe that they have more room to maneuver without drawing retaliation. Mr. Nasrallah said on Friday that Hezbollah was stronger than ever.For hours on Sunday, Al Manar, Hezbollah's television network, broadcast martial songs. In southern Lebanon, Hezbollah fighters and United Nations peacekeepers were on heightened alert.On social media, loyalists quickly commemorated the slain fighters, calling them martyrs.Hezbollah also said that among the dead was Mohammad Ahmed Issa, 42, said to be a leading commander. The Hezbollah member said an Iranian had also been killed, fueling speculation that Iranian military figures were present.It was not immediately clear whether the strike targeted specific individuals, said Prof. Eyal Zisser, a Tel Aviv University expert on Syria and Lebanon, but he said that Mr. Mughniyeh was well known to the Israelis. ""When you put a helicopter in the air there is not likely to be anything coincidental about it,"" Professor Zisser said.In addition to several attacks on weapons headed for Hezbollah, Israel has retaliated with what it calls pinpoint strikes at sources of fire from Syria into the Israeli-occupied part of the Golan Heights. (Israel seized part of the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 war and annexed the area in a move that has not been recognized internationally.)But this is the first time since the Syrian civil war began that Israel has targeted a specific group of Hezbollah fighters in Syrian territory.Hezbollah, which fought a monthlong war against Israel in 2006, has struck Israel in recent months, laying several bombs along the border between Lebanon and the Israeli-held part of the Golan Heights, and injuring several Israeli soldiers on patrol.The Hezbollah member said that one such recent attack was in retaliation not for Israeli operations in Syria, but for an Israeli strike that killed a Hezbollah operative in southern Lebanon as he tried to dismantle an Israeli spy device. He said that Hezbollah had not used its new fighting positions in Syria to target Israelis.Yoav Galant, a former senior commander in the Israeli military who is running for Parliament, said the timing of such military actions is sometimes ""not unconnected to election campaigns.""",1.0
World Briefing | Middle East; Yemen: Scores Killed in Airstrikes That Hit Markets:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- About a hundred people have been killed by airstrikes across Yemen in the past three days as warring parties have haggled over the terms of a humanitarian cease-fire, health workers and security officials said.The airstrikes were carried out by a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia that has been trying for months to defeat the Houthis, a Shiite rebel group from northern Yemen. The two worst episodes came Monday when bombs struck markets near the southern port city of Aden, killing 40 people, residents said, and in Amran Province in the north, killing 40 more, according to a local security official. Smaller groups of casualties were reported in separate attacks.Doctors Without Borders, which operates several medical facilities in Yemen, said in a statement that hundreds of people had sought treatment in recent days after being wounded in airstrikes and random shelling across the country.At least 3,000 people have been killed in the past three months of fighting, according to the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. Mr. Ban and other diplomats have pushed for a cease-fire during the holy month of Ramadan, which ends next week, to allow for the delivery of relief supplies to Yemen, the region's most impoverished country.Out of a population of 26 million, at least 15 million in Yemen have no access to health care and about four in five Yemenis need some form of humanitarian aid, the United Nations said.Full-scale war in Yemen erupted in March, when Saudi Arabia launched its offensive to drive the Houthis from Sana, the capital, and several other cities the rebels were fighting to control. The Saudis vowed to restore President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whom the Houthis had driven into exile.Hundreds of people have been killed as the Houthis and their allies among the security forces loyal to a former Yemeni president have laid siege to Aden, the country's second-largest city, and Taiz in central Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition, which is backed by the United States, has conducted hundreds of airstrikes in heavily populated areas, killing scores of civilians, according to human rights groups.The combatants had all expressed their openness to a cease-fire but have so far failed to implement it. Last week, Abdullah M. al-Saidi, a minister in the Saudi-backed Yemeni government in exile, said a halt to the war seemed ""likely."" On Monday, Rajeh Badi, a spokesman for Mr. Hadi, told the Reuters news agency that the exiled government was seeking ""guarantees"" that the Houthis would withdraw from cities they seized.As the negotiations have dragged on, the Saudi-led coalition has intensified its airstrikes, including in Sana, which has suffered some of the heaviest bombing since the conflict began.On Saturday, at least 13 people were killed when airstrikes struck a market, a restaurant and a cooking-gas station in the northern Hajjah Province, a few hours after residents had broken their daily Ramadan fast, according to Ayman Ahmed Mathkoor, the provincial health director. Doctors Without Borders put the toll at 20 or more and said medical teams had been ""overwhelmed"" by the number of wounded.In Taiz, where the Houthis have been battling local militias, at least 16 people have been killed since Thursday by random shelling, Doctors Without Borders said.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
Death of Qaeda Leader in Yemen Is Unconfirmed:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Yemeni officials and extremists reported on Monday that the leader of Al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate and recently the second-ranking official of the global terror network, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, had been killed in an American drone strike. American officials said they could not confirm the reports but were investigating.Mr. Wuhayshi, 38, had led Qaeda operations in Yemen since 2002 and built Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula into what counterterrorism officials considered the most dangerous group targeting the United States homeland, though all of its attacks failed. The group was responsible for dispatching two underwear bombers -- one bomb fizzled, and the other bomber was a double agent -- to blow up airliners over American soil, and for planting explosives in printer cartridges aboard two commercial cargo planes bound for Chicago.It was the second time in two days that the fate of a militant leader targeted in an American strike was uncertain. Over the weekend, American F-15s carried out an airstrike in Libya on Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a leading Algerian terrorist, but by Monday his death remained very much in doubt.The uncertainty about whether Mr. Wuhayshi and Mr. Belmokhtar were dead underscored a recurring lesson from the Obama administration's campaign of targeted killing of suspected terrorists: Even with multiple sources of intelligence, it is hard to be sure whom the missiles have hit in remote areas thousands of miles from the United States.And although American counterterrorism officials would consider the deaths of the two men a major victory, the strikes in both countries took place as anti-American extremists are advancing and government authority is dissolving.In Yemen, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a Sunni extremist group, has been strengthened by the support of Sunni tribesmen as much of the country has been taken over by a Shiite militia known as the Houthis. Qaeda militants now control more territory than at any time since 2012.In Libya, factional fighting since the ouster and death in 2011 of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the longtime dictator, has permitted multiple militant groups to seize territory and recruit supporters, including affiliates of both Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.""The tactical, whack-a-mole approach is not having the desired effect,"" said Micah Zenko, who studies counterterrorism policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.There was no official confirmation of Mr. Wuhayshi's death from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Supporters expressed condolences on social media, while others fretted that the group faced grave internal dangers, despite its capture of territory in recent months, as Al Qaeda leaders were killed, one by one.""Al Qaeda, to where?"" one supporter wrote on Twitter, lamenting that the group had become a ""hotbed of intelligence.""There were reasons to be cautious. The death of Mr. Belmokhtar, who planned an attack on an Algerian gas plant in 2013 in which 38 foreign workers died, has been reported several times over the years. And militants on Twitter announced that Mr. Wuhayshi had been replaced by the Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's military commander, Qassim al-Raymi. Mr. Raymi's death was widely, and inaccurately, reported in a 2010 strike.Dirk Vandewalle, an expert on Libya at Dartmouth, said that strikes were no substitute for a more lasting strategy in Libya, where the breakdown of authority had contributed to a migration crisis as impoverished Africans try to reach Europe.""What we have in Libya is utter chaos,"" Mr. Vandewalle said. ""The American strike shows that we're still relying on ad hoc measures rather than consistent policies along with the Europeans.""But Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, praised the decision to strike at militants in Libya.""You can't defeat ISIS without taking on the Libya problem,"" he said, noting that as Islamic State extremists come under pressure in Syria and Iraq, they must be deprived of a haven in Libya.""If we don't act in Libya, we'll see it go down a rat hole,"" Mr. Nunes said. ""And if that happens, it could spread to Tunisia and, God forbid, to Egypt.""In Yemen, grisly photographs in a local newspaper showed the aftermath of the drone strike last Tuesday that might have killed Mr. Wuhayshi. Witnesses told the newspaper that a drone had fired two missiles, killing three Al Qaeda members who had gathered in a public area near the beach.The photographs showed a small crater on a stone plaza, overlooking the ocean. Another showed what appeared to be a bloodied torso, on a stretch of beach. The newspaper said that members of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula arrived after the strike, asked bystanders to leave the area and collected the bodies.On Monday, Pentagon officials said they believed, though they could not be certain, that the weekend strike in Libya had killed Mr. Belmokhtar. Col. Steven H. Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said the military was ""still conducting the post-strike assessment to determine whether or not our intended target was eliminated.""A militia leader in Ajdabiya, a coastal town in the country's northeast where the strike took place and a public funeral was held on Monday, said it was impossible to be sure who had been killed.The bodies of at least eight of the dead were charred beyond recognition, said the militia leader, who asked not to be identified for his own safety. Some militants survived the strike and were taken to a hospital, where fighters for a local branch of the Ansar al-Shariah Islamist group skirmished with local guards and took their wounded away about 11 a.m. on Monday, he said.There are rumors of imminent reprisals against those suspected of helping the Americans, the militia leader said.Meanwhile, Al Akhbar, a Mauritanian website that has previously published Mr. Belmokhtar's messages, including his claim of responsibility after the 2013 attack on the gas plant, published an article on Monday saying that six of Mr. Belmokhtar's men were killed in the weekend strike.It did not list Mr. Belmokhtar among the dead.The article, written in French, said that the strike hit a garden inside Ajdabiya around 2 a.m. local time on Saturday. It was inside this garden that Mr. Belmokhtar was presiding over a meeting of Qaeda members, it said.An individual associated with the Shabab, Al Qaeda's East African branch, also denied that Mr. Belmokhtar had died. ""Heard from two AQ bros that he's alive, and 6 of the mujahedeen have been killed,"" he wrote in a private message.",1.0
American Strike Targets Planner of Algeria Raid:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- The United States carried out an airstrike in Libya early Sunday against the mastermind of the 2013 terrorist seizure of an Algerian gas plant that left 38 foreign hostages dead, American and Libyan officials said on Sunday.The Libyan government issued a statement Sunday night saying that the airstrikes killed the terrorist leader, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, and ""a number"" of Libyan terrorists in the eastern part of the country.American officials confirmed that Mr. Belmokhtar was the target of the strike, carried out by multiple American F-15E fighter jets. But they expressed caution about his fate, saying forensic proof was needed to declare with certainty that Mr. Belmokhtar had been killed. Given the likely extent of the damage -- multiple bombs were dropped on the target, officials said -- that determination could take some time unless terrorist websites issue an official statement of mourning.The Libyan statement said: ""The Libyan government announces that American planes undertook action that resulted in the death of the wanted terrorist Mokhtar Belmokhtar and a number of Libyans belonging to one of the terrorist groups in Eastern Libya, after consultation with the Libyan interim government to take action on terrorist leadership present on Libyan soil.""If confirmed, the death of Mr. Belmokhtar would be a major counterterrorism victory for the United States against one of the world's most wanted militants.""I can confirm that the target of last night's counterterrorism strike in Libya was Mokhtar Belmokhtar,"" said Col. Steven H. Warren, a Defense Department spokesman. He said Mr. Belmokhtar ""has a long history of leading terrorist activities"" and ""maintains his personal allegiance to Al Qaeda.""The United States government, he said, was ""continuing to assess the results of the operation and will provide more details as appropriate.""Mr. Belmokhtar is an Algerian militant with a long history in the Sahel region, which falls on the southern flank of the Sahara stretching from Senegal to Chad. Although his direct operational ties to Al Qaeda may have lessened, his stature as a terrorist leader has grown.Called the Prince by his entourage, he was considered the last major surviving figure among the jihadists in North Africa. All the others have been killed in French raids. He is certainly the most feared among them because of his operational and planning skills.Born in Algeria, he fought in the Algerian civil war of the 1990s. He joined a militant group based in Algeria and took up smuggling and kidnapping for ransom; one terrorist raid included the abduction of a Canadian diplomat in late 2008.Mr. Belmokhtar's success in maneuvering largely unhindered for years in the deserts of northern Mali and southern Algeria and Libya was a result of his masterful integration into the local populations. He married a woman from Timbuktu, Mali; spoke the local dialects; and shared some of his rich takings from more than a decade of kidnapping Westerners.The Canadian diplomat, Robert Fowler, a former United Nations special envoy, was released after four months. He said in a 2013 interview, ""I was always impressed by the quiet authority he exhibited."" Mr. Fowler met with Mr. Belmokhtar several times during his captivity in the desert.Among his militant names is Laaouar, or the One-Eyed, because it is said he may have lost an eye while fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, where he learned combat skills. A major cigarette trafficker, he is also known as Marlboro Man.Mr. Belmokhtar became a leading figure in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or A.Q.I.M., the Qaeda affiliate in North Africa. He was the most experienced of four leaders of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb until he broke with the group to lead Al Mulathameen Battalion, which was officially designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department in 2013.In January 2013, Mr. Belmokhtar led the attack on a gas plant in Algeria that resulted in the death of 38 civilians, including three Americans. Four months later, his group joined with a West African terrorist faction -- the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa -- to carry out attacks in Niger that killed at least 20 people, the State Department said.In August 2013, Mr. Belmokhtar's faction and the West African extremists announced that they were joining to form yet another group, Al Murabitoun. But the merger fell apart, and the other militants split from Mr. Belmokhtar's group. This year they announced they had joined the Islamic State.Mr. Belmokhtar has remained loyal to Al Qaeda. His last public statement was a rebuke of his colleagues who had gone to the Islamic State, who he said had ""violated the foundation"" of their organization.Western diplomats say that intelligence agencies have been tracking Mr. Belmokhtar in and out of Libya at least since a late 2012 spotting in Tripoli. But the targeting by American air power came up in just the past 48 to 72 hours, a senior American official said. Officials confirmed that American surveillance drones had been part of the effort to track the terrorist leader.""It was a strike on an extremist leadership target whom we believed posed a threat against American and Western interests,"" said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence reports.The attack marked the first time the American military has carried out any kind of airstrike in Libya since the NATO operation there in 2011 that helped oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.American commandos, though, have carried out other operations in Libya since the NATO air war.In October 2013, American forces captured a Libyan militant who had been indicted in 2000 for his role in the 1998 bombings of the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The militant, born Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai and known by his nom de guerre, Abu Anas al-Libi, had a $5 million bounty on his head.In June 2014, American commandos operating under the cover of night seized the man suspected of leading the deadly 2012 attack on the United States Mission in Benghazi, Libya, ending a manhunt that had dragged on for nearly two years and inflamed domestic and international politics. About two-dozen Delta Force commandos and two or three F.B.I. agents descended on the outskirts of Benghazi in predawn raid to grab the suspect, Ahmed Abu Khattala. No shots were fired, and the suspect was removed from Libya to a United States Navy warship in the Mediterranean, on which he was transported to Washington for prosecution.The airstrike against Mr. Belmokhtar came as the group's chief ideological rival, the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, has expanded its presence inside Libya, alarming Western officials because of the country's proximity to Europe, across the Mediterranean.Four years after the removal of the Qaddafi regime, the near-collapse of the Libyan government has left no central authority to check the group's advance or even to partner with Western military efforts against it.Two armed factions, each with its own paper government, are fighting for control, and each has focused more on internal quarrels than on defeating the Islamic State.",1.0
Increasingly Frequent Call on Baltic: 'The Russian Navy Is Back':   [Foreign Desk ],,"KLAIPEDA, Lithuania -- The Emanuel, a 90-foot trawler, has what is supposed to be a humdrum job, plying a 30-mile stretch of the Baltic Sea to make sure vessels do not snag their anchors on a pair of electricity cables recently installed on the seabed.On the morning of April 30, however, the Emanuel's captain sent an alarming message to the Dutch operator of the trawler. ""The Russian Navy is back,"" he reported, adding that Lithuania had also sent a warship to the area, a patch of shallow water off this Lithuanian port city.The encounter passed without violence, and the cables, being built to connect Lithuania to Sweden's electricity grid, were left undisturbed. But the intrusion, one of four this year by Russian warships into the cable-laying zone, was yet another round in what has become a nerve-rattling test of wills between Russia and the West over former Soviet lands since the conflict in Ukraine started last year.Cutting the region's dependence on Russian energy -- long one of Moscow's main levers to squeeze its neighbors and get its way -- has become central to that contest, and it is something Moscow is making increasingly clear it considers a threat, both financial and geopolitical.Hence its show of displeasure with the electricity connectors, which include the pair of 250-mile-long underwater cables between Klaipeda, Lithuania, and the Swedish city of Nybro, as well as one now under construction from Lithuania to neighboring Poland. They are the final, crucial link in Lithuania's dogged drive to free itself of reliance on Russian energy.Lithuania's energy minister, Rokas Masiulis, said he believed Russia was simply ""flexing its muscles"" rather than preparing for a direct strike on the cables, which are due to start carrying electricity from Sweden by the end of the year.Russia has been conducting nearly nonstop naval exercises in the Baltic Sea -- including on 26 of 30 days in April, according to Lithuanian officials -- and it is regularly entering Baltic airspace with its warplanes.""They keep up constant pressure just to show they have influence,"" Mr. Masiulis said. ""It is all part of the general atmosphere of provocation and rising tensions in the region.""That has included other displays of Russian strength, or at least audacity, like the abduction of an Estonian intelligence officer last year in what Estonia says was a cross-border operation.Lithuania's foreign minister, Linas Antanas Linkevicius, said he had tried to get an explanation but had gotten nowhere because Moscow declined even to respond to repeated requests for clarification. Lithuania, he said, lodged a series of formal diplomatic protests but ""got no reply.""The United States is also making its presence felt, and it held its annual naval exercises in the Baltic Sea last week with an unusually large number of ships, aircraft and personnel from NATO countries, including Lithuania, as well as nonmembers like Sweden. Russian vessels shadowed American ships as they left the port in Poland.The flurry of Russian naval activity along the route of the high-voltage cables also suggests a more targeted agenda. It has sent a blunt warning of Russia's disquiet over threats to one of its principal geopolitical goals: keeping a firm grip on energy supplies as a powerful political and commercial tool in neighboring territories Moscow would like under its thumb.With the arrival here in October of a huge floating factory to convert liquefied natural gas from Norway into the burnable variety, Lithuania secured independence from Russia for gas, and it is now pushing on with the undersea cables in the hope that it can do the same for electricity. Lithuania currently imports 60 percent of the electricity it needs from Russia and from its fellow Baltic nations.On the same morning that the Emanuel reported the arrival of the Russian Navy in the cable zone, the captain of the Alcedo, a second vessel tasked with guarding the seabed cables, reported troubles of its own.In a message to Rederij Groen, the Dutch company that operates the Alcedo, the captain said a Russian naval vessel had ordered him to clear out of the area until the evening. ""Left location and set course to north,"" he added.""When you are a civilian ship and you get told to move by a military ship, you move,"" said Daivis Virbickas, chairman of the board of Litgrid, Lithuania's electricity transmission system operator. The company is sponsoring the cable project in partnership with Svenska Kraftnat, its Swedish counterpart.""For us, this is not just a piece of cable,"" Mr. Virbickas added, noting that Lithuania declared political independence from the Soviet Union 25 years ago and that it was finally breaking free of its dependence on Russia's electricity network.""We can only assume that others are not happy with this,"" Mr. Linkevicius said. He described Russia's response to Lithuania's quest for energy independence as ""political hooliganism.""Lithuania, a nation of three million people, matters little as a market for Gazprom, Russia's natural gas giant, or Inter RAO, Russia's electricity exporter. But its success in breaking dependence on Russian energy shows bigger countries in Eastern Europe that history and geography are not destiny.""We are a good example for others to follow,"" said Mr. Masiulis, the energy minister. He noted that as soon as Lithuania started importing liquefied natural gas from Norway last year and broke what had been a Gazprom monopoly, the Russian gas company offered an ""instant discount of 23 percent"" on its price.Lithuania's electricity prices are among the highest in Europe, and Litgrid predicts they will fall drastically once the links to Sweden and Poland provide an alternative to imports from Russia.While Russia's concerns seem clear, the exact purpose of its naval actions in the Baltic Sea has led to much head-scratching, especially as they have so far failed to derail or even delay the cable project.Rytas Staselis, a Lithuanian expert on energy issues, speculated that the harassment could be a form of retribution for the environmental and legal hurdles put up by Europe that complicated construction of Nord Stream, a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, and helped torpedo South Stream, a second Russian-sponsored gas pipeline.Another theory is that the Russian Navy's actions in the Baltic Sea are a gambit by President Vladimir V. Putin in a long, grinding campaign to unsettle and divide the European Union.Russian warships first tangled with the Baltic Sea electricity link in May last year, soon after a Swedish engineering company, ABB, began work to lay the cables. At the time, the episode seemed a one-off annoyance.But Russian activity around the undersea cables resumed with increased vigor this spring after a series of moves by the European Union to blunt the power of Russia's abundant energy supplies. The European bloc has put up more than $230 million to help pay for the nearly $600 million cable project, known as Nordbalt.""The E.U. is always very slow to act on any problem, but when it finally moves, it is hard to stop it,"" said Marius Laurinavicius of the Eastern Europe Studies Center, a research unit in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.In February, the European Union announced an ambitious plan to form a so-called energy union, a venture that aims to knit together Europe's diverse energy systems and make them less vulnerable to interruptions in supplies from outside sources, notably Russia.Then, in April, Brussels took a direct swipe at Gazprom. Antitrust regulators announced that they were charging Gazprom with abusing its dominant market position, a move long urged by Lithuania.That same month, Russia sharply accelerated its military activity in the Baltic Sea, according to Lithuania's Foreign Ministry, leading to three new intrusions along the route of the electricity cables.""Russia's ultimate goal is to destroy the European Union and NATO, but this is very hard to achieve,"" Mr. Laurinavicius said. ""Its interim goal is simply to show that Russia is a major power that has to be taken into account.""Photograph A Royal Air Force Jet, Bottom, Accompanied a Russian Ilyushin Il-20m Reconnaissance Plane Over the Baltic Sea, Where Russia has Been Conducting Naval Exercises, Lithuanian Officials Said.

An Errant Attack by U.S. Helicopters Kills at Least 7 Afghan Soldiers:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- In one of the deadliest episodes of its kind in Afghanistan in recent years, American helicopters opened fire on an outpost belonging to the Afghan Army in the eastern province of Logar on Monday, killing at least seven Afghan soldiers and wounding five, officials said.This was the second time in less than two years that American forces had mistakenly targeted Afghan soldiers in Logar. A similar case in March last year left five dead.In a further twist, after the strikes, Taliban fighters on about 25 motorcycles mounted an offensive to take over the destroyed outpost, but they were repelled by members of the Afghan Local Police after two hours of heavy fighting, said Sabir Khan, the commander of the police unit.In a statement, the United States military headquarters acknowledged the casualties and expressed ""deep regret"" and condolences, adding that a joint investigation with Afghan officials was underway.Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan president, ""expressed his profound sorrow over the death and wounding of a number of Afghan National Army soldiers as a result of an airstrike by the international forces,"" his office said in a statement.""The president reiterated that the international forces take maximum precautions not to harm the people and security forces of Afghanistan in their operations in the future,"" the statement added.Mohammad Rahim Amin, the district chief of Baraki Barak, where the strike took place, said that the attack happened at 6:40 a.m. and that seven soldiers were killed and five wounded.""The outpost was completely destroyed; it was fired upon a lot,"" Mr. Amin said. ""The bodies were in bad shape.""He added that a new group of soldiers had been moved into the outpost.Baraki Barak is a volatile district about 40 miles from Kabul. Hours after the shooting on Monday, the government delegation sent to retrieve the bodies was ambushed by Taliban fighters, who were advancing on the security posts in the area. Mr. Khan, the police commander, said their posts were under heavy enemy fire.""After the American strikes, the Taliban tried to run over the outpost and capture the five wounded soldiers lying there,"" Mr. Khan said.Two hours of fighting later, he said, the Taliban were pushed back, and the government delegation was able to retrieve the bodies and take them to the provincial capital.""The heads of two of the soldiers were missing,"" Mr. Khan said.Farooq Jan Mangal contributed reporting from Khost Province, and Joseph Goldstein from Kabul.Photograph Soldiers Wounded in the Strike On an Afghan Army Outpost On Monday.

"China Has Deployed Artillery on Artificial Island, U.S. Asserts:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SINGAPORE -- The United States has spotted a pair of mobile artillery vehicles on an artificial island that China is building in the South China Sea, a resource-rich stretch of ocean crossed by vital shipping lanes, American officials said.China's construction program on previously uninhabited atolls and reefs in the Spratly Islands has already raised alarm and drawn protests from other countries in the region, whose claims to parts of the South China Sea overlap with China's. The United States has also become increasingly vocal about its objections in recent days.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter called this week for China to halt the construction, saying that international law did not recognize Chinese claims of sovereignty over the new territories and that American warships and military aircraft would continue to operate in the area. He reiterated those assertions in a speech Saturday morning in Singapore at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual security conference that brings together most Asian countries and many other powers outside the region.""We all know that turning an underwater rock into an airfield simply does not afford the rights of sovereignty,"" Mr. Carter said.The United States, he added, is ""deeply concerned about the pace and scope"" of China's island building and the possibility of increased militarization, which risks the kind of miscalculations that could lead to conflict.Mr. Carter announced a new $425 million maritime security initiative to help countries in Southeast Asia improve their naval and coast guard capabilities.China is not the only country to develop outposts in the South China Sea over the years, Mr. Carter noted. Vietnam, for instance, has 48, and the Philippines, a close American ally, has eight.""Yet, one country has gone much farther and much faster than any other,"" he said. ""And that's China.""China has constructed over 2,000 acres of new territory in the Spratly Islands in the past 18 months, which is ""more than all other claimants combined,"" Mr. Carter continued. ""It is unclear how much farther China will go."" The artillery was spotted by satellites and surveillance aircraft about a month ago on one of the new islands China has built, and the two vehicles have since either been hidden or removed, according to another American official who spoke about intelligence matters on the condition of anonymity. The official added that even if the weapons remained on the island, they posed no threat to American naval forces or aircraft in the region, though the guns could reach some nearby islands claimed by other countries.With Mr. Carter in Singapore for the security conference, which Chinese officials are also attending, American officials were reluctant to publicly discuss the intelligence they had collected about the artillery.Brent Colburn, a spokesman traveling with Mr. Carter, would say only that the United States was aware of the weapons, whose detection was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who heads the Armed Services Committee, criticized China's deployment of artillery on the island as ""a disturbing development and escalatory development.""""Their actions are in violation of international law, and their actions are going to be condemned by everyone in the world,"" Mr. McCain was quoted by Reuters as saying in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where he stopped on Friday on his way to Singapore for the conference.""We are not going to have a conflict with China,"" he said, ""but we can take certain measures which will be a disincentive to China to continue these kinds of activities.""There was no immediate comment from Chinese officials about the weapons. But China has sent its most high-powered delegation yet to the annual meeting in Singapore; a top military official, Adm. Sun Jianguo, is scheduled to speak at the conference.China released a military strategy document this week that, for the first time, called for its navy to project force beyond its coastal waters into the open oceans. Western officials said that because of its timing, the document seemed intended as a challenge to other participants in the conference.And days before the document was released, China demanded that an American military surveillance plane leave the skies above Fiery Cross Reef, which China has built into an island with a runway that its military can use. The American aircraft did not alter its course, American officials have said.China has said that it was building the artificial islands largely for civilian purposes, but it has not denied that it also envisions a military role for them. ""Such constructions are within China's sovereignty and are fair, reasonable, lawful and do not affect nor target any country, and are beyond reproach,"" Hua Chunying, the spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry, told reporters in April.The United States disagrees, and American officials have stressed in recent days that the American-dominated security order in the region should be respected because it has brought calm and prosperity, a theme Mr. Carter will develop in his remarks on Saturday in Singapore.""It's important for the region to understand that America is going to remain engaged,"" he said, and it will ""continue to stand up for international law and universal principles and help provide security and stability in the Asia-Pacific for decades to come.""The implication is that China is threatening to upend that system, though Mr. Carter and other American officials have hesitated to say so directly, preferring to talk in generalities about the need for diplomatic solutions and inclusive security arrangements.But the island-building has been a major concern of the United States and Southeast Asian nations for more than a year, and Mr. Carter is not the first head of the Pentagon to say so at a regional security forum.At last year's Shangri-La Dialogue, Chuck Hagel, Mr. Carter's predecessor, said that China was engaged in ""destabilizing, unilateral actions asserting its claims in the South China Sea."" The Philippines has also spoken out against Chinese island building.China has countered by pointing to the outposts built by the Philippines and Vietnam in the South China Sea. But analysts say that the two nations did not build islands, and in any case their structures were generally built before 2002, when China and nine Southeast Asian nations signed a nonbinding agreement to ""exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities"" and to refrain from trying to inhabit any land features that were uninhabited at that time.American and Southeast Asian officials are concerned that China may try to claim an exclusive economic zone in waters within 200 nautical miles of the new land formations, which they argue are ineligible for determining such zones.",1.0
Russian Military Insignia Are Reported in Ukraine:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- International monitors tracking cease-fire violations in eastern Ukraine reported Friday that they had encountered four people wearing military uniforms with Russian insignia in a town about 25 miles southeast of the regional capital of Donetsk, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists.In its daily report, the special monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said a young man had reported that ""an unknown armed group"" had occupied the grounds of a former children's campground in the town, Petrivske. According to the report, monitors ""spoke to two women, both wearing military uniforms, with caps with Russian Federation Armed Forces insignia.""""During the conversation with the two women, a vehicle with Russian Federation number plates stopped next to the O.S.C.E. vehicles and two armed men, similarly dressed, exited the car and ordered the women to stop the conversation,"" the report stated. Behind a fence surrounding the camp, the monitors ""observed one infantry fighting vehicle,"" according to the report. The monitors could not enter the camp.The report was a rare allegation by the international monitors of a possible sighting of active Russian military personnel in eastern Ukraine. The monitors, however, did not identify the women or men who were observed in uniform in Petrivske, and there was no way to independently verify the monitors' account.Although there has been substantial other evidence of Russian military activity in eastern Ukraine cited by journalists, as well as by Ukraine and its Western allies, including the United States, the monitors for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have not previously reported a definitive observation of uniformed personnel bearing Russian insignia.On Nov. 13, the monitors reported seeing ""five unarmed men in camouflage, with Russian Federation flag patches and other badges on their uniforms,"" in the city of Luhansk, but noted that they were ""unable to ascertain the affiliation of these men.""The monitors have regularly reported unmarked military convoys pulling heavy weaponry toward Donetsk, said Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the monitoring mission. Asked if monitors had previously seen such clear evidence of Russian military insignia, Mr. Bociurkiw replied, ""No, we haven't.""The Kremlin in recent days has reiterated its longstanding denials that any active-duty Russian forces have been present in eastern Ukraine, despite substantial evidence to the contrary, including dozens of military funerals in Russia during the past year of fighting. Ukrainian forces this month captured two fighters who have identified themselves as active-duty Russian soldiers from a special forces unit, the Third Special Forces Brigade, based in Togliatti in southern Russia.The Russian government has confirmed that the two men are Russian citizens but insists that they are former military personnel who left active service before going to Ukraine.In an interview with Reuters, published Friday, the men said again that they were Russian military personnel. One of the men, Sgt. Aleksandr Aleksandrov, told the news agency that he was in the middle of a three-year contract, which he had never canceled, and that he felt abandoned by his country. ""I never tore it up; I wrote no resignation request,"" Sergeant Aleksandrov said. ""I was carrying out my orders.""The potential political fallout from Russian soldiers' being wounded and killed in eastern Ukraine seems to be increasingly worrisome for the Kremlin. On Thursday, President Vladimir V. Putin decreed that Russian casualties in ""special operations"" can be classified as military secrets even in peacetime.Despite Mr. Putin's repeated denials that Russian soldiers are fighting in Ukraine, his critics say Russia not only continues to intervene militarily in Ukraine but is turning its back on soldiers who are wounded or killed there.The monitors for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe also reported Friday that a separatist leader, Aleksandr V. Zakharchenko, the prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, had told them he was ""unavailable to attend meetings outside the country until the end of July due to health reasons."" This presented a potential stumbling block in efforts to negotiate full implementation of the cease-fire accord signed in Minsk, Belarus, in February.Russia, which helped broker the accord together with Ukraine, France and Germany, has insisted that it wants to put the peace deal into effect.The United States, however, has criticized Russia for failing to live up to its obligations under the agreement and of obstructing efforts to carry out steps required to achieve a long-term political resolution of the Ukraine crisis. The Kremlin says the failure to carry out the accord is the fault of the Ukrainian government in Kiev.In its report on Friday, the security and cooperation organization noted an increase in cease-fire violations compared with those of recent days, including 150 explosions heard from an observation point near the central railway station in Donetsk, consistent with mortar and tank fire. Because of security concerns, the monitors said they could not observe the situation in Shyrokyne, the scene of some intense clashes in recent weeks. But from an observation point in the city of Mariupol, the monitors reported hearing explosions coming from the direction of Shyrokyne.""We do see a deterioration,"" said Mr. Bociurkiw, the organization's spokesman.

,,"SANA, Yemen -- Saudi Arabia said Saturday that it would halt its military offensive in Yemen for five days to allow the distribution of humanitarian relief supplies, according to a statement carried by the official Saudi news agency.A Saudi-led military force has been bombing Yemen since late March in order to defeat the Houthis, a rebel group that drove Yemen's Saudi-backed government from power this year and controls substantial territory.The truce announcement came a day after the Saudi-led coalition was accused of being responsible for killing more than 100 civilians in air attacks, one of the highest death tolls of the war. Witnesses and medical officials said a series of airstrikes late Friday slammed into residential compounds for workers at an electricity plant in the coastal city of Mokha, killing the civilians.The Saudis had refused to abide by a previous cease-fire two weeks ago that was brokered by the United Nations and would have halted the fighting during the holy month of Ramadan. Saudi officials said at the time that they had received no formal request to stop fighting from Yemen's exiled president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi.Their change of heart on Saturday appeared to reflect the Saudis' rapidly improving fortunes in the war. Last week, local militiamen and other fighters backed by the Saudis drove the Houthis from most of the southern Yemeni city of Aden, giving the coalition its first significant victory as well as a beachhead that could be used to broaden the offensive.More than 1,700 civilians have been killed in Yemen since the war began four months ago, including hundreds by coalition bombs.The compounds that were bombed on Friday housed more than 1,300 people, according to Abdullah Al-Fadhli, a local council member in Mokha. At least eight airstrikes hit the buildings -- with some of the bombs killing rescue workers who responded to the first strikes, he said.",1.0
China Objects to U.S. Flights Near Artificial Islands:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- The United States and China on Friday escalated their dispute over contested territory in the South China Sea, after the Chinese repeatedly ordered an American military surveillance plane to abandon flights over areas where China has been building artificial islands.The continued American surveillance flights in areas where China is creating new islands in the South China Sea are intended to challenge the Chinese government's claims of expanded territorial sovereignty. Further raising the challenge, Pentagon officials said they were discussing sending warships into waters that the United States asserts are international and open to passage, but that China says are within its zone of control.The Defense Department planning comes in response to China's accelerated efforts to build new islands in the South China Sea to bolster claims to a vastly expanded area of sovereignty, a direct challenge to the United States and other nations in the region.The Chinese government expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"" with the surveillance flights, while urging the United States to cease actions that they said risked increasing tensions. Hong Lei, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, warned that the American flights, which he called ""very irresponsible and dangerous,"" were ""likely to cause an accident.""But the Obama administration was adamant in saying that the American Navy surveillance flights were made in international airspace. Officials from the State Department and the Pentagon said that China's land reclamation in the South China Sea was undermining stability in the region and that the Chinese had no business building airstrips on the contested Spratly Islands.""This land reclamation is going fast,"" Cmdr. William Marks, the Navy's chief of media, said in an interview on Friday. ""Really fast -- faster than we ever imagined."" He said the Navy had no intention of stopping its almost daily reconnaissance flights.""We have freedom of flight over international airspace,"" he said.The Navy on Thursday released video footage of an incident Wednesday when a Chinese military dispatcher issued eight warnings -- in English -- to a Navy P8-A Poseidon surveillance plane as it flew over Fiery Cross Reef, the site of an extensive Chinese land reclamation project in the Spratly Islands, a group of reefs halfway between Vietnam and the Philippines in the South China Sea. The Navy also released video footage that it said documented the continued expansion of the reefs, which have been turned into artificial islands with airport infrastructure, including a runway.American military officials took a CNN crew along on the Navy reconnaissance flight on Wednesday; a military official said the decision to take a television crew and to release the video footage was deliberate.""It's important that the American public, and the Asian public, too, understands what's going on out there,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about a delicate international issue.A second Defense Department official said discussions were underway on whether the military would increase its naval presence in international waters in the area, including additional patrols using frigates, destroyers and small combat ships. Such a move would most likely further annoy China. Disagreement over the Spratly Islands has continued for several years. The Spratlys are claimed by at least three other countries, including the Philippines, an American ally, and Vietnam, which has sought warmer relations with Washington.Earlier this year, analysts released satellite images of a concrete runway that China was building on Fiery Cross Reef, one of the Spratly Islands. The runway is expected to be about 10,000 feet long. The construction on Fiery Cross Reef is part of a larger Chinese reclamation project involving scores of dredgers on at least five islands. China is converting tiny reefs, once barely visible above water, into islands large enough to handle military hardware, personnel and recreation centers for workers.The Chinese government has maintained that the reclamation efforts are meant to serve civilian purposes like providing a base for search-and-rescue operations. But the Chinese military has also said that the reclamation is for ""necessary military defense.""A senior administration official expressed concern that China was trying to build up the islands as a way to make a case for Chinese sovereignty -- to ""create facts on the ground -- and we can't allow that."" Separately, Daniel R. Russel, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia, told reporters that American military aircraft would continue to exercise the right to operate in international airspace.Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, China has asserted claims in the South China Sea that have increasingly butted against Asian allies of the United States. In particular, the issue of territorial boundaries has come into play.The United States says that foreign aircraft have the right to fly over waters beyond a nation's 12-mile territorial line. China, meanwhile, asserts that foreign aircraft do not have the right to fly within its 200-mile exclusive economic zone without permission.The contentious issue has flared up before. In late 2013, China set off a trans-Pacific uproar when it declared that an ""air defense identification zone"" gave it the right to identify and possibly take military action against aircraft near disputed islands in the East China Sea. Japan, which administers the islands, refused to recognize China's claim, and the United States has since defied China by sending military planes into the zone, unannounced.The islands, known as the Senkaku in Japanese and the Diaoyu in Chinese, are a seven-hour boat ride from Japan, even farther from China. But they, like the Spratlys, have been at the center of ongoing territorial disputes among China and its neighbors.Pentagon officials say they worry that China will try to declare another air defense identification zone over the Spratlys. ""Is this foreshadowing?"" one Defense Department official, who spoke anonymously to discuss a national security matter, said on Friday. ""Well, we can certainly see them trying.""""The Navy flyover was a measured response, meant to signal to the Chinese that the world is watching -- literally -- their provocative reclaiming of land that people don't agree that they own,"" said Andrew L. Oros, an associate professor of political science at Washington College in Chestertown, Md., and a specialist on East Asia. ""This idea that China has, that it can just act unilaterally when other people don't agree, has to be confronted.""To build the artificial island, China has dispatched concrete pylons on cargo vessels from the mainland to build a retaining wall and create the island and a harbor, according to Sean O'Connor, a former United States Air Force intelligence analyst who now works as the principal imagery analyst for IHS Janes, a publication that examines military issues.China has used dozens of dredges that suck up sand and then dump it to make landfill and has constructed concrete manufacturing plants to provide a foundation for runways, he said.Mr. O'Connor said the Chinese seemed to be particularly focused on the runway. ""It looks as though they go over and over it again to make it thick, and can take any kind of plane,"" he said in a telephone interview. In particular, he said, the Chinese would be interested in landing bombers and fighter jets.",1.0
Violence Flares at India-Pakistan Border:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISLAMABAD -- Tensions erupted into violence on Thursday between the estranged, nuclear-armed neighbors Pakistan and India, as both sides made competing claims of violations by security forces along a de facto border in the disputed Kashmir region.Pakistani officials said at least four civilians were killed and several more were wounded after Indian forces opened fire on areas across the contested border. Three civilians were reported killed in two villages near Sialkot, and an 18-year-old woman was killed in Rawalakot, a spokesman for the Pakistani military said. Pakistani Rangers responded to the Indian gunfire, military officials said.Local news outlets broadcast images of residents in border villages near Sialkot holding pieces of mortar shells.On Wednesday, India's paramilitary Border Security Force accused Pakistan of shooting at an Indian border post and of firing mortar shells that landed in a border village, killing one woman and wounding four people, including a soldier at a border post, according to The Associated Press.Both India and Pakistan claim the Kashmir region, an area between northern India and northern Pakistan that has caused decades of tension and sporadic violence between the two nations since the partition at the end of British colonial rule in 1947.Thursday's border clashes come a day after the Pakistani military claimed to have shot down an Indian drone that Pakistan said had violated its airspace on the disputed Kashmir border. The Indian Defense Ministry issued a statement saying that no drone had been shot down.Nonetheless, Pakistan summoned the Indian high commissioner to the foreign office and the foreign secretary ""lodged a strong protest"" over the allegations of airspace violation.The escalation of tensions between the two nations came less than a week after a meeting in Russia between their prime ministers, Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Narendra Modi of India. Both sides had painted the meeting, on July 10, in a positive manner. Pakistan said that Mr. Modi had accepted Mr. Sharif's invitation to visit Pakistan in 2016 during a summit meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, or S.A.A.R.C. Both sides had also announced plans to hold meetings with security officials.Analysts and some politicians here speculated that hawkish elements in the security establishments on either side were opposed to peace.Some analysts pointed out that there had been a consistent pattern of tension between the countries anytime there was a prospect of relations improving.""Whenever there is a development toward peace, such incidents take place,"" said Farhatullah Babar, an opposition senator in Pakistan, during an appearance on a private television news network. ""There are elements on both sides who don't want normalization of ties.""",1.0
"U.S. Increases Airstrikes in Afghanistan on Taliban and Its New Rival, ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- The American military has intensified its airstrikes in Afghanistan in recent weeks, expanding them to include a bombing campaign against Islamic State militants who defeated the Taliban in fighting over a sliver of territory in the eastern part of the country.Throughout June, American drones and warplanes fired against militants in Afghanistan more than twice as much as they had in any previous month this year, according to military statistics.The increase in the use of American air power comes more than six months after President Obama declared that the American combat mission in Afghanistan had ended. The vast majority of the strikes appear to remain focused on Taliban forces, the traditional targets of American airstrikes here for more than a decade. But several have targeted insurgent commanders who defected from the Taliban to swear allegiance to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.American officials have said that the strikes against the Islamic State were part of a defensive policy to protect the coalition forces from harm. But Afghan officials said the strikes against Islamic State targets came partly at the urging of the Afghan domestic intelligence service, which thought it was time to remove them or risk the Islamic State's gaining a foothold in eastern Afghanistan.""We needed to take action,"" said one Afghan official who has been briefed on some of the intelligence that preceded the strikes. ""The willingness on the part of the Americans to provide the air support is always there.""American military officials had played down the Islamic State's activity, but it flared quickly in the eastern Nangarhar Province in the late spring.Since then, American missiles have struck two large-scale gatherings of Islamic State fighters in the province, killing top commanders.""The department anticipated a summer uptick in insurgent activity, and we were prepared to protect our forces,"" said a Pentagon spokeswoman, Henrietta Levin, accounting for the increase in airstrikes. She added, though, that the United States was closely monitoring the growth of the Islamic State in Afghanistan to see if it has a ""meaningful impact.""The pace of airstrikes presents a wild card in the tentative discussions between the Afghan government and the Taliban's leadership over the possibility of peace negotiations.The airstrikes could undermine the Taliban's willingness to negotiate with the Afghan government and could indirectly strengthen the group's legitimacy to an Afghan public that widely loathes the American airstrikes. Or, the airstrikes might give the Afghan government more leverage in negotiations.In a statement released on Wednesday, which was said to come from the Taliban's long-reclusive supreme leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban gave their blessing to exploring peace negotiations ""concurrently with armed jihad.""The Taliban reiterated their demand that foreign troops leave Afghanistan, in particular the country's airspace. Mullah Omar's statement emphasized that jihad remained an obligation because Afghanistan's ""land and airspace are controlled by the invaders.""After years of taking a heavy toll on the insurgency, the recent expansion to target Islamic State forces has become a benefit for the Taliban in parts of Nangarhar. Insurgents with the Taliban and other groups there had lost considerable ground to the upstart cells of Islamic militants. Still, the largest share of the strikes continues to focus on the Taliban, according to interviews and local news reports. Others have targeted Pakistani militants who fled into eastern Afghanistan to escape a Pakistani military offensive.Though the number of strikes in June reached a high point for 2015, it still represented an overall decrease from previous years. The 106 weapons fired this June were less than half the 272 fired in June 2014. In June 2011, the figure was 610 weapons fired.Two senior Afghan officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, suggested that part of the new surge in airstrikes was linked to improved targeting information from the Afghan spy service, the National Directorate of Security. One official said, ""Coordination and intelligence sharing with the Americans has increased in recent months,"" particularly in Nangarhar.In one recent strike, the Afghan intelligence service claimed to have tracked Hafiz Saeed Khan, the Islamic State's chief for Khorasan, an old name for a region that includes Afghanistan and Pakistan, to a recent meeting of militant leaders.""He was trying to escape in a vehicle after the first hit,"" another Afghan official said. ""There were six hits total, and we believe the fifth killed him."" Some social media accounts associated with the Islamic State, however, deny that Mr. Khan is dead.The Islamic State's momentum in Nangarhar has not been replicated elsewhere in Afghanistan, where the organization has been thwarted by the Taliban or is still in the recruitment phase. But in Nangarhar, over the course of at least two dozen skirmishes with the Taliban, the Islamic State emerged as the dominant presence in several districts.In one district, the Islamic State fighters went door to door, having first ""wrapped their faces with scarves,"" and told villagers with ties to the Taliban to leave, Akram Haji, a resident, said. In some areas, the removal applied to almost everyone, since many families have a son or father who has fought for the Taliban or supported them.""They offered us the choice of following their principles and joining the Islamic State or leaving,"" another resident said.Some residents recognized the new fighters as local residents or as men from surrounding districts. Others said the Islamic State's ranks had swelled with Pakistani fighters.The Islamic State imposed a few new rules in areas it controlled, including a ban on naswar, a style of smokeless tobacco. But many residents said the differences between the rival groups were hard to discern.""It's challenging to judge which one is really struggling for Islam,"" said Mohammad Wazir, a farmer from Sherzad District, whose village was seized by Islamic State militants.Mr. Wazir was interviewed in Rodat District, not far from his home, where many families that had lived in territory now held by the Islamic State have resettled.The effect of the airstrikes on the Islamic State's position in Afghanistan remains to be seen.A member of Parliament from Nangarhar, Ismatullah Shinwari, described the drone strikes as ""tremendously effective"" and said that without them, he feared that the Islamic State might have grown strong enough to have ""taken control of the capital of Nangarhar,"" Jalalabad, an important Afghan city.In public statements, as well as in a letter addressed to the Islamic State's self-declared caliph, Abu-Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Taliban have warned the Islamic State to stay out of Afghanistan.In the most recent issue of Dabiq, the Islamic State's online English-language magazine, the group derided Mullah Omar as a minor leader lacking global vision. It said Mullah Omar ""was at most one day a former leader of one of the Islamic lands,"" and possibly dead. Mullah Omar has not been seen in public in years.",1.0
U.S. Strike Is Said to Kill an ISIS Leader in Afghanistan:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- A senior Pakistani militant leading the Afghanistan and Pakistan chapter of the Islamic State was killed in an airstrike by United States forces in eastern Afghanistan on Friday, Afghan officials said on Saturday.The death of the senior militant, Hafiz Saeed Khan, who defected from the Pakistani Taliban last year and was introduced as the head of the Islamic State in the region in January, could not be confirmed independently. Twitter accounts associated with the Islamic State rejected the news, suggesting that it was a false rumor similar to reports of his killing that circulated in April.Twenty-nine other militants were killed in Friday's airstrike, in the Achin District of eastern Nangarhar Province, officials said. It was the second time in a week that United States forces, working on intelligence provided by the Afghan government, targeted Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan.Abdul Hassib Sediqi, a spokesman for Afghanistan's intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, said, ""As a result of an airstrike in Achin district on a gathering place of individuals connected to Daesh, 30 of their members, including their leader, Hafiz Saeed, were killed."" Daesh is the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL.Mr. Sediqi said Mr. Khan's identity was confirmed when his body was identified.A spokesman for the Pentagon confirmed a ""precision strike in Achin,"" but declined to provide further details about the targets of the strike, or to comment on whether any particular militant leaders were killed. At least one Afghan official said the strike that killed Mr. Khan was delivered by a drone.The strike in Afghanistan came on the back of a larger United States air offensive against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the previous 24 hours, according to a military statement, the coalition carried out 34 strikes -- 17 each in Iraq and Syria -- hitting Islamic State buildings, bunkers, vehicles and resupply positions.Afghan officials have long downplayed the threat posed by the Islamic State to Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying it is the same old Taliban fighting under a new name. But comments from officials in recent weeks, and the increase in operations specifically targeting former Taliban fighters who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, suggest that the group is now seen as dangerous to the region's stability.In a meeting with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, on Friday, President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan said the Islamic State was ""a threat for security of the region.""The Afghan intelligence agency has also reported the creation of a special unit to follow Islamic State activities. The agency recently released a five-minute video of what it said was its ""special force for fighting Daesh.""Reports of Mr. Khan's killing in Achin came days after coalition forces targeted a leadership council meeting of the Islamic State in the same district. In that strike, on Monday, Mr. Khan's deputy, Gul Zaman, and one of his senior commanders, Shahidullah Shahid -- formerly the main spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban -- were killed. The total toll from the strike was unclear, with Afghan reports ranging from 24 to 45 deaths.Many of the Pakistani militants fled to eastern Afghanistan after the Pakistani military launched an offensive in its tribal areas last year. Some parts of the east, particularly in Nangarhar Province, have turned into battle zones between the Afghan Taliban and militants who have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.Also on Saturday, a blast in southern Kandahar Province killed three children and wounded six others, officials said. Samim Khaplwak, the spokesman for the provincial governor, said explosives had been placed in a pillow near a religious school on the outskirts of the city of Kandahar.""We do not know if the targets were the children,"" Mr. Khaplwak said.",1.0
Drone Strike Kills 2 Pak istanis Tied to ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ],,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- Two senior Pakistani militants who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State were among at least 24 people killed in an American drone strike in eastern Afghanistan on Monday, Pakistani and Afghan security officials said Thursday.Afghan officials described one of the men, Gul Zaman, as the deputy leader of the Islamic State in Afghanistan. The other commander, Shahidullah Shahid, had been the main spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban until he joined Islamic State last year.Though officials do not yet consider the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, to be a major threat in either Pakistan or Afghanistan, the group has drawn increased support from disaffected Taliban militants on both sides of the border over the past year.A senior Pakistani official in Peshawar said both men had been killed alongside several other militants in an American drone strike in Nangarhar Province, in eastern Afghanistan, on Monday. The official said the drone strike had targeted a leadership council meeting of the so-called Islamic State in Khorasan, an old term that includes Pakistan and Afghanistan.A spokesman for the Afghan intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, confirmed the deaths in a public statement. The total toll from the strike was unclear, with Afghan reports ranging from 24 to 45 deaths.Mr. Shahid announced his allegiance to the Islamic State after the Pakistani military began an offensive last year in the North Waziristan tribal region, which had long been a safe haven for the militants in northwestern Pakistan.That offensive, and a parallel operation in the Tirah Valley in Khyber tribal agency, forced many militants to flee across the border into Afghanistan.Gul Zaman, also known as Mullah Fateh, had been second-in-command to the regional head of Islamic State, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed. It was not clear whether Mr. Saeed was present at the meeting, the Pakistani official said.""It was a pretty massive hit,"" said the Pakistani official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity and said he was citing sources inside Afghanistan. ""So many I.S. fighters and commanders have been killed in one go.""The official said that Pakistani Taliban fighters based inside Afghanistan had retrieved the bodies from the wreckage of the targeted building. Officials say that the Islamic State and the Pakistani Taliban have been engaged in a violent turf battle in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan.",1.0
World Briefing | Africa; Mali: French Troops Kill a Top Militant:   [Foreign Desk ],,"On Nov. 2, 2013, two French journalists were grabbed in the troubled northern Malian town of Kidal. Hours later, their bodies were found on a dirt track, lying near their kidnapper's car, which had a broken steering wheel.Investigators later determined that the journalists had been abducted by gunmen loyal to Al Qaeda's regional branch, a group that has financed itself by kidnapping Europeans for ransom.But this time, when the car broke down, the gunmen called their commander, who allegedly ordered that the journalists -- Ghislaine Dupont, 57, Radio France Internationale's senior correspondent, and her sound technician, Claude Verlon, 55 -- be killed, according to a senior Malian intelligence official.On Wednesday, France's Ministry of Defense confirmed that French troops had killed the man believed to have been that commander: Abdelkarim al-Targui, of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.""In the night of May 17 to 18, French special forces carried out an operation in northern Mali. Four terrorists were killed during the ensuing combat. Among them was Amada Ag Hama, who used the alias 'Abdelkarim the Tuareg,' "" the ministry's statement said, using an alternative spelling of Targui.The journalists' killings shocked France as severely as the journalist James Foley's beheading last summer shocked the American public, so Mr. Targui's death is symbolic for France, one of the most prolific payers of ransoms to Al Qaeda.For years, a crisis unit in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris tried to negotiate the release of at least three other French citizens held by Mr. Targui's platoon, or by brigades to which he was subordinate in northern Mali.He proved to be one of the most intransigent of Al Qaeda's regional leaders, most of whom approached kidnapping strictly as a business, making sure to take good care of hostages in order to trade them for suitcases of cash.By contrast, two of the three French citizens known to have been held by Mr. Targui's brigade were killed -- one in retaliation for a French-led airstrike and the other for trying to escape -- suggesting a harder hand than most of his terrorist colleagues in the Sahara.In addition to Ms. Dupont and Mr. Verlon, Mr. Targui's unit was involved in the kidnapping of Serge Lazarevic and Philippe Verdon, French citizens who had traveled to Mali to do a feasibility study for a new mine. They were grabbed from their hotel rooms in late 2011. According to a senior negotiator, who requested anonymity to speak on a delicate subject, Mr. Verdon was killed by Mr. Targui's men in 2013 after trying to use a mirror to signal to a French aircraft overhead.Mr. Lazarevic was freed last Dec. 9 after the release of several Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb prisoners in Mali, according to a statement by Mali's justice minister. Experts tracking the terrorist group suspect that France paid a ransom, but the amount remains unknown.Another hostage, Michel Germaneau, 78, a French engineer, was kidnapped in Niger in 2010 and killed three months later in revenge for a French military raid on the group. Mr. Germaneau was under the control of a different commander, Abou Zeid, but reports have emerged that Mr. Targui was among the foot soldiers assigned to watch over the hostage, and some negotiators believe Mr. Germaneau was killed by Mr. Targui.""He was a big fish,"" said an elected official from Kidal, who requested anonymity to discuss an intelligence matter. ""He was at the foundation of everything. It's he who took Lazarevic, and Verdon and Germaneau. It was always him in the background. This is a big strike against the group. They are paying a big price.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
Kiev Claims to Capture 2 Soldiers of Russia:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- The Ukrainian government said on Monday that it had captured two wounded Russian soldiers in eastern Ukraine and would prosecute them on terrorism charges, prompting a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin to repeat the Kremlin's longstanding denial that any Russian troops had been deployed across the border.The soldiers were identified by Gen. Viktor Muzhenko, the chief of the general staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as Capt. Yevgeny Yerofeyev and Sgt. Aleksandr Aleksandrov of the Third Special Forces Brigade, which is based in Togliatti, a city in southern Russia.Russia's denials that its active duty soldiers have been fighting in eastern Ukraine have continued despite substantial evidence to the contrary, including the funerals of young Russian soldiers killed in action. The Kremlin has acknowledged that some Russians have participated in the fighting, but says that they are volunteers who often choose to fight during their vacations.""Despite allegations and despite official statements of the Russian Federation about the absence of the Russian troops in eastern Ukraine, we are ready to present evidence of the opposite,"" General Muzhenko said in a televised news conference in Kiev, the capital. ""We know their names, their military ranks, as well as their military stations.""General Muzhenko and other Ukrainian military officials said the Russians had been captured after a clash between their unit and Ukrainian forces near the city of Shchastya, about 15 miles north of the regional capital of Luhansk, which is a stronghold of pro-Russian separatists.Viktor Nikolyuk, the commander of Ukrainian forces involved in the fight, said one of his soldiers had been killed and another wounded. He said that the two captives were from a reconnaissance unit that included 14 other Russian soldiers, and that they had been provided with medical treatment immediately after being taken prisoner.In a video posted to YouTube by Anton Gerashchenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, Sergeant Aleksandrov identifies himself as a member of the Russian special forces unit and Captain Yerofeyev as his commander. He said he had been serving in eastern Ukraine since May 6.Victoria J. Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, who was visiting Moscow on Monday for meetings with Russian officials about efforts to fulfill a cease-fire agreement in Ukraine, said she had received assurances from the Ukrainian government that the two captives were being treated well.Ukrainian officials said they would be prosecuted on terrorism charges and face sentences of up to life in prison.At a news conference on Monday, Mr. Putin's spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, initially said the questions about the two captured soldiers should be directed at the Defense Ministry, not the Putin administration.""Of course, I cannot confirm it, because we are not whom the question should be addressed to,"" Mr. Peskov said, when asked if the two men were indeed Russian military personnel. ""We and the Defense Ministry on many occasions have said that there were not any Russian military in Donbas,"" he said, referring to the embattled Donets River basin.He suggested that ""specialists"" in the Defense Ministry were better positioned to answer. When a reporter noted that Mr. Putin was also commander in chief of the Russian military, Mr. Peskov replied: ""I understand, but anyway in this case, it is not us who the question should be addressed to. I repeat one more time: The main thing, actually the basis of what can be answered, is that there were and there are no military men there.""Russia's military intervention in Ukraine, beginning with the annexation of Crimea, and continuing in the east with supplies of fighters, weapons and training for separatist forces, has brought relations between Russia and the West to one of their lowest points since the Cold War, and prompted the United States and its allies to impose economic sanctions against a number of Mr. Putin's closest confidantes.A cease-fire agreement reached in February has substantially reduced the fighting, but there are constant violations. Kiev has complained repeatedly that the border with Russia remains open, and that Russia continues to supply weapons and training to the separatist forces.",1.0
Saudi-Led Airstrikes Resume in Yemen as Truce Ends:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- A military coalition led by Saudi Arabia resumed airstrikes in Yemen on Sunday, hours after the expiration of a five-day humanitarian cease-fire between the coalition and Houthi rebels.Residents in the southern city of Aden reported warplanes flying overhead late Sunday and the sound of airstrikes falling on what appeared to be Houthi-controlled neighborhoods in the city.There had been no official statement from Saudi Arabia about whether it intended to renew the truce when it lapsed at 11 p.m. on Sunday. International aid agencies, as well as the United Nations envoy to Yemen, had called for an extension in order to continue delivering relief supplies to Yemen, which has been under an air and sea blockade since the Saudi-led coalition began its offensive against the Houthis in late March.The escalation of the fighting on Sunday appeared to threaten a frenzied relief effort that had sought to take advantage of the break in the fighting. On Sunday, aid workers acknowledged that those efforts so far had been insufficient, given the scale of the crisis in Yemen, a deeply poor country that relies almost entirely on imports for basic goods.Emergency supplies, delivered by chartered planes and rickety wooden dhows during the truce, reached only a small fraction of those in need, relief workers said.Unicef said it had been able to resupply health care centers, activate mobile medical teams in rural areas affected by the fighting and supply fuel that allowed local authorities to run water systems. The group also delivered solar-powered refrigerators to keep vaccines cold in a country starved of electricity.""It's nowhere near enough,"" said Julien Harneis, Unicef's Yemen representative. ""A country of 26 million people was essentially cut off from any commercial shipping as a result of the way the arms embargo is being implemented,"" he said, referring to the Saudi-led blockade.Ships that were able to dock during the truce provided a ""minute percentage of the amount of goods that need to come into the country for any normal life,"" Mr. Harneis said.André Heller Pérache, of Doctors Without Borders in Yemen, said the devastating shortage of fuel had hardly eased during the cease-fire.""Hospitals are still scrambling to find fuel for generators,"" he said. Without fuel for cars, people struggled to reach hospitals. ""The capital city is dark at night.""Saudi Arabia proposed the cease-fire this month as it faced growing criticism of its military campaign against the Houthis, a rebel group from northern Yemen that had taken control of the capital and other parts of the country and forced the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile.Hundreds of airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition of Arab states failed to stop advances by the Houthis in Aden and the city of Taiz. The combination of the bombing campaign and a brutal offensive by pro-Houthi forces has killed more than 1,400, most of them civilians.The cease-fire halted airstrikes on Sana after weeks of bombing, but fighting continued in Taiz and elsewhere. It remained unclear whether the airstrikes on Sunday signaled a full-scale resumption of the war or were a deft attempt by the Saudis to restore a military advantage, and could be followed by another truce.Speaking on Sunday at a conference on the Yemen crisis in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a special envoy from the United Nations read a statement from Secretary General Ban Ki-moon that called for all parties to come together to resolve the conflict and urged an extension of the cease-fire.The conference, convened by Saudi Arabia, consisted of only one side in the domestic conflict, bringing together Yemeni factions and regional organizations that support the effort to restore Mr. Hadi to power. It excluded any representatives of the Houthi movement or their allies among the backers of Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's former president.""The humanitarian truce should turn into a permanent cease-fire,"" the envoy, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, said, reading the statement. There was ""no solution to the crisis but comprehensive dialogue that will not exclude anyone.""",1.0
"Border Clash With Iraqis Kills Seven, Saudis Say:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Four heavily armed men from Iraq attacked a Saudi border patrol early Monday, firing automatic weapons and detonating suicide belts in a confrontation that left three guards and all the assailants dead, Saudi officials said.The early morning clash, which the Saudis described as an attempted infiltration near an isolated patch of the Saudi-Iraqi frontier, was one of the deadliest episodes of border violence for Saudi Arabia.It was likely to raise fears of jihadist infiltrations in the kingdom from Iraq and Yemen -- another radical Islamist breeding ground that shares a border with Saudi Arabia, which controls access to Islam's holiest sites.Saudi officials said the border guards had suspected the men were trying to sneak across the border. When confronted, the men fired automatic weapons and detonated suicide belts to avoid arrest, the officials said.It was unclear whether the assailants were affiliated with any organization. No group has claimed responsibility. A spokesman for Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry, Maj. Gen. Mansour Turki, said by phone that the Saudi authorities were working to learn more about the attackers.""Two of them blew themselves up and two of them were killed in clashes, so we have to work on establishing their identities,"" General Turki said.Al Qaeda has attacked the kingdom in the past. The Islamic State has threatened attacks as retribution for Saudi participation in an American-led bombing campaign against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.Both General Turki and a report on the state-run Saudi Press Agency described the clash as a result of a confrontation, not an armed assault on a border post.Monitoring the frontier with surveillance technology, the border guards had gone to investigate four men seen near the border, General Turki said.As the guards approached, thinking the men could be smugglers, the men opened fire. The guards fired back, killing one of the men. In the ensuing battle, another man was shot dead by border guards and the other two blew themselves up.Three border guards were also killed.The men had been carrying weapons that included a machine gun and hand grenades and some cash.General Turki said he could not remember the last time an armed clash had occurred on its border with Iraq, although he said some positions had been targeted by mortar fire from the Iraqi side.Hassan Abu Hanieh, a Jordanian expert on Islamist groups, said he doubted that the Islamic State had sent the men because of the small scale of the operation.""I don't think that ISIS would launch a small, failed operation like this given all of its capabilities,"" he said. ""That doesn't seem like their way.""Mr. Abu Hanieh said the assailants more likely had been associated with Al Qaeda, which has tried many times to sneak into Saudi Arabia from Yemen, its southern neighbor.",1.0
Ukraine: U.N. Details Fighting's Toll as U.S. and Russian Officials Meet:   [Foreign Desk ],,"GENEVA -- The United Nations said on Monday that a sharp escalation in recent fighting in eastern Ukraine had left more than 800 people dead and over 3,400 wounded, with hundreds missing and many buried without their deaths being recorded.Ivan Simonovic, the United Nations assistant secretary general, told reporters here that more than 6,000 people had been killed since the fighting started in April -- at least 842 of whom died from mid-January to the middle of last month.The casualty figures were included in a United Nations report issued on Monday that also said an influx of troops and heavy weapons from Russia had intensified the conflict in Ukraine.""Credible reports indicate a continuing influx of heavy and sophisticated weaponry to armed groups in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as foreign fighters, including from the Russian Federation,"" the United Nations report said.""This has fueled the escalation of the conflict and new offensives by armed groups, undermining the potential for peace as armed groups extend their areas of control,"" the report said. ""This has resulted in further and significant increases in civilian and military casualties.""The report was issued as Secretary of State John Kerry met with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, in Switzerland to discuss the crisis in Ukraine.Mr. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said in a speech to the Human Rights Council here in Geneva that the cease-fire in Ukraine was being ""consolidated"" and that any decision by Western nations to send arms to Ukraine would ""disrupt the peace.""The Obama administration has been considering whether to send arms to Ukraine to deter Russian-backed separatists and Russian troops from further advances, though the White House appears to have put off a decision in recent weeks.Mr. Kerry said that to avoid further sanctions, Russia must arrange for the separatists to relax their grip on the strategically important town of Debaltseve, which they seized soon after a cease-fire reached last month in Minsk, Belarus, went into effect.""There has been a kind of cherry picking"" by the Russians about what elements of the cease-fire to honor, Mr. Kerry told reporters at a news conference on Monday. ""There is not yet a full cease-fire.""Mr. Kerry said that he had raised his concerns about the seizing of Debaltseve and the presence of Russian-backed separatists near the port city of Mariupol during his morning meeting here with Mr. Lavrov.A rocket attack on Mariupol at the end of January killed 31 people, according to Mr. Simonovic, citing an example from the United Nations report of the growing use of heavy weapons by all sides and indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas.The report also drew attention to the plight of civilians in areas of conflict, saying that attempted evacuations in government-controlled areas had apparently been targeted by shelling. But travel restrictions imposed by the government in Kiev had also made it harder for civilians to escape conflict areas, the United Nations said.More than 400 civilians continue to be held prisoner by pro-Russian armed groups, the United Nations monitors reported, noting that an ""all for all"" prisoner exchange included in the cease-fire agreement signed last month had not been fully enacted.

World Briefing | Asia; China: Pentagon Says Naval Ships Entered U.S. Waters Off Alaska:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Five Chinese Navy ships that sailed this week off the coast of Alaska entered United States territorial waters, but they have since left the area, Pentagon officials said on Friday.Capt. Jeff Davis, a Defense Department spokesman, said that at one point the ships had come within 12 nautical miles of the United States, which put them inside American territorial waters. But Captain Davis said that it was a ""legal transit"" of the ships in the Bering Sea and that the Chinese had complied with international law.Defense officials said that this was the first time that the American military had noted such activity by China. The ships' arrival in the area came as President Obama was touring Alaska.The Chinese venture into waters off the Alaskan coast occurred as China has increasingly been flexing its military muscle, particularly in waters off the coast of China. Beijing has increased military spending and now has an aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.Last year, Chinese officials took Chuck Hagel, the defense secretary at the time, on a tour of the carrier, and many American officials interpreted the move as an effort to project Chinese naval power, particularly in light of tensions between Beijing and its neighbors over disputed islands in the East and South China Seas.But Beijing announced this week that it was cutting its military by 300,000 people, a move that American officials said was meant to project China's peaceful intentions -- but also a signal that President Xi Jinping intends to reorganize and modernize the Chinese military.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
45 Soldiers From U.A.E. Are Killed in Yemen:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- The United Arab Emirates said on Friday that 45 of its soldiers were killed fighting Houthi insurgents in a province east of Yemen's capital, in a major setback for the coalition of Arab forces that have been trying for months to vanquish the rebels.The death toll was the largest in a single day for the military of the United Arab Emirates, the Persian Gulf nation that has assumed a central role in the Saudi-led coalition seeking to restore Yemen's exiled government to power.A statement carried by a Houthi-run news agency said that the deaths came after the rebels fired what it called a ballistic missile at a military base used by the coalition in Marib Province, striking an arms depot and destroying other equipment, including Apache helicopters.Bahrain, another member of the Saudi coalition, said on Friday that five of its soldiers also had been killed.The casualties undercut recent battlefield gains by the Saudi-backed forces as well as confident assertions by Yemeni government officials that the coalition was poised to rout the Houthis from their stronghold in the capital, Sana.With more than 4,000 people killed, Yemen has hosted one of the region's bloodiest conflicts since the coalition began bombing the Houthis and their allies nearly six months ago.The casualties reported Friday came at time when diplomats had been hoping to move the antagonists closer to a cease-fire. In a sign of how the conflict could quickly escalate, warplanes of the Saudi-led forces carried out some of the most intense airstrikes on the capital in weeks on Friday. They bombed military targets on the outskirts but also targeted the Defense Ministry, near Sana's historic old city, a Unesco World Heritage site, sending residents of nearby buildings fleeing the area.The Emirates state news agency said the country's fighters had carried out ""destructive airstrikes"" against ""strongholds of the rebellious militias.""The Saudi-led coalition began bombing Yemen in March after the Houthis, a northern rebel group, drove the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi from power and into exile. After months of a stalemated battle, Emirati soldiers played a critical role in shifting the war in favor of the coalition, including by helping anti-Houthi forces recapture Aden, a port city in Yemen's south.The forceful military intervention by the United Arab Emirates, which has committed thousands of troops, was part of a united effort by the Sunni Persian Gulf monarchies to counter what they viewed as Iran's backing of the Shiite-led Houthis. While Friday's high death toll was unprecedented for the Gulf states fighting in the coalition, dozens of allied Yemeni anti-Houthi fighters have been killed in ""friendly fire"" attacks by coalition warplanes.The Houthis have long denied receiving significant support from Iran and said in their statement on Friday that the attack on the base was ""a legitimate response by the army and popular committees to the crimes and genocide committed by the Saudi aggression and its mercenaries.""",1.0
"Warplanes Hit Wedding in Yemen, Reports Say:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SANA, Yemen -- Warplanes with the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition bombed a wedding party on Yemen's Red Sea coast on Monday, killing at least 70 civilians, according to two local officials and a relative of one of the victims.The aerial attack, in Wahija, south of the port city of Mokha, appeared to be among the deadliest involving civilians since the start of Yemen's war this past March. The death toll was difficult to confirm, in part because the bodies of the victims were badly mangled, witnesses said.The killings added to criticism of the Saudi-led coalition for carrying out what human rights advocates and aid workers said was a military campaign that increasingly failed to distinguish between military targets and civilians. The coalition's stated goal has been to beat back the Houthis, a rebel group from the north that has seized control of Sana, the capital, and other territory that has forced the government into exile.A coalition spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, told Reuters on Monday that the reports of the killings at the wedding were ""false news"" and that there had been no coalition air operations in the area for the last three days. Efforts to reach General Assiri for further comment were unsuccessful.Thousands of civilians have died as most of western Yemen has been swept up in war, and the majority of those deaths have come in airstrikes. In almost every case, the Saudi coalition has either denied responsibility for the killings or blamed Houthi militants. Saudi Arabia has also sought to head off a mission to Yemen by human rights investigators with the United Nations who would look into violations by all the warring parties.The Obama administration, which has supported the Saudi war effort by providing intelligence and logistical support, has avoided any direct public rebuke of the Saudis, while calling on coalition planners to investigate reports of civilian casualties.The attack on Monday morning was at least the third time in the last 10 days that the coalition had been blamed for killing large numbers of civilians. Since Sept. 20, bombings in Sana have killed at least 28 people, including 11 members of one family. On Sunday, helicopters flying from Saudi Arabia killed at least 30 people in a village near the Yemen border, local residents and medical personnel told Reuters.In a sign that the pace of the deaths was becoming harder to ignore, Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, issued an unusually sharp public criticism of the Saudi-led coalition in an address to the General Assembly in New York on Monday.""All sides are showing disregard for human life -- but most of the casualties are being caused by airstrikes,"" he said, according to a transcript of his remarks. ""I call for an end to the bombings, which are also destroying Yemeni cities, infrastructure and heritage,"" he added.Ahmed Altabozi, who said a niece, Fatma Al-Khaishani, had been killed in the bombing of the wedding party, called the attack inexplicable. The wedding tents were in a remote stretch of the desert, far from any ""military sites, soldiers or the presence of the state."" The majority of villagers had already left the area, fearing the airstrikes, he said.Mr. Altabozi said that he heard the bombs from his house, which is less than a mile away, about 11 a.m. Two initial airstrikes hit one tent, and other bombs, minutes later, fell on a second tent where a group of women had taken shelter, causing most of the casualties, he said.""I saw no body intact,"" he added.A local council official had said early Monday that the groom, Mirsal Buseibis, had been killed, but Mr. Altabozi said Mr. Buseibis had survived.",1.0
Saudi Officials Deny Killing Yemeni Civilians:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANAA, Yemen -- Attack helicopters flying from Saudi Arabia killed 30 civilians in a Yemeni village on Sunday, according to accounts by residents and local medical officials. But the Saudi authorities dismissed the accounts as ""totally false.""Apache helicopters fired rockets at the village of Bani Zela in Hajjah Province, roughly seven miles from the Saudi border, killing at least 25 civilians, including women and children, the residents and medics said. Helicopters then returned for a second strike as residents and medical teams were trying to evacuate casualties, killing three medics and two more civilians, they said.""People were fleeing their homes as the helicopters pursued,"" said a resident who identified himself as Khaled. ""They committed a massacre for no reason.""Yemen's Saba news agency, run by the Houthi group now in control of much of the country, put the death toll at 28 and said 17 others were injured. A Saudi official said that the military coalition of Arab states it is leading in Yemen had played no role in any attack in the area. ""This is totally false news. We deny it,"" said the official, who declined to be identified, adding that no coalition helicopters operated so far from the border.The Saudi-led campaign over the past six months has resulted in several mass killings of civilians, including 36 people at a water bottling plant in August.",1.0
France Says Its Airstrikes Hit an ISIS Camp in Syria:   [Foreign Desk ],,"PARIS -- In France's first airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Syria, warplanes destroyed a training camp, President François Hollande announced on Sunday.At a news conference in New York, where he had arrived for the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Hollande said that the warplanes had attacked the training camp in eastern Syria after it had been identified by French air surveillance with help from the coalition of Western and Middle Eastern states conducting the air campaign against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.""Our forces reached their objectives: The camp was completely destroyed,"" Mr. Hollande said. ""Six jets were used, including five Rafales, and they were able to ensure that our operation did not have any consequences for the civilian population.""He added that France might launch other strikes in the coming weeks if necessary, with the goal of ""identifying targets that are training camps or places where we know that the Daesh terrorist group can threaten the security of our country.""Prime Minister Manuel Valls also confirmed to reporters in southeastern France that the airstrikes had taken place.""We are striking Daesh in Syria because this terrorist organization prepares and organizes attacks in France from Syria, from these sanctuaries,"" Mr. Valls said. ""We are therefore acting in self-defense, which Article 51 of the United Nations Charter permits us to do.""Mr. Hollande's announcement did not come as a surprise. He said this month that France would start air surveillance missions over Syria, and a week later, his defense minister confirmed that France was gathering intelligence to conduct airstrikes on Islamic State targets there.France was already involved in the air campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq, but it had been reluctant to hit the group in Syria out of fear of indirectly helping the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.The French government has shifted its position in the face of fears that the Islamic State is recruiting disaffected youths in France and sending or coordinating with European fighters back home to stage attacks. The flow of Syrian refugees arriving in Europe has also apparently pushed the French government to be more active in the conflict.In a statement released by his office on Sunday, Mr. Hollande said a ""global response"" to the chaos in Syria was required.""Civilian populations must be protected against all forms of violence, that of Daesh and other terrorist groups, but also against the deadly bombings by Bashar al-Assad,"" he said.France has repeatedly said that Mr. Assad's departure is necessary for a political solution to the Syrian crisis.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

Pentagon Says Chinese Pilot Flew Too Close to Spy Plane:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- A Chinese fighter jet performed an unsafe maneuver last week while close to a United States spy plane, Defense Department officials said Wednesday. It is the second time in just over a year that the Pentagon has accused Chinese pilots of inflaming tensions.Military officials said the latest episode occurred Sept. 15 about 80 miles east of the Shandong Peninsula in the Yellow Sea. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Chinese fighter jet passed in front of an American RC-135 reconnaissance plane in an unsafe way.Pentagon officials said the planes did not come close to colliding. But the Defense Department is reviewing the episode and may issue a démarche, or diplomatic complaint, to the Chinese authorities, as it did last year after a similar episode, officials said.News of the episode came during a visit by President Xi Jinping of China to the United States, amid rising tensions between the two countries, particularly over Chinese actions involving disputed islands in the East and South China Seas.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said that he did not know about the episode but that China was committed to maritime and aviation security. China is dedicated ""to establishing mutual military trust with other countries to appropriately manage differences,"" he told reporters, according to Reuters.In August 2014, there was a similar, if more theatrical, episode in which a Chinese fighter jet flew within 30 feet of a Navy surveillance and reconnaissance plane in international airspace just off the Chinese coast.The episode began when the Chinese warplane flew close underneath a Navy P-8 Poseidon. It then moved parallel to the naval plane, with the wingtips of the two aircraft separated by less than 30 feet.As a final maneuver, the Chinese fighter jet executed a barrel roll, apparently to show off its weapons payload to the American pilot. A barrel roll is when a fighter jet rolls over and then levels out.Military officials take such intercepts seriously, particularly given that a Chinese fighter jet collided with a United States Navy spy plane in April 2001 in the skies above Hainan Island. The Chinese pilot was killed, and the American plane was forced to make an emergency landing on Hainan.After the collision, the Chinese authorities detained the American crew for over a week and issued an angry initial statement saying that ""the U.S. side has total responsibility for this event.""Adm. Dennis C. Blair, the commander in chief of the United States Pacific Command at the time, issued his own angry statement, saying that the Chinese plane had been tailing the American jet, a practice that Beijing's military had increasingly adopted.China has continued to show off its military prowess to the United States in the years since the Hainan episode. This month, five Chinese Navy ships entered United States territorial waters off Alaska, Defense Department officials said. That move came as President Obama was touring Alaska.Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.",1.0
At Least 13 Reported Dead in Yemen Strikes:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MUKALLA, Yemen -- Airstrikes by a Saudi-led military coalition killed at least 13 civilians working early Sunday at a water plant in northern Yemen, the plant's owner said.The bombings appeared to be the latest in a series of airstrikes by Saudi Arabia or its Arab coalition partners that have hit civilian facilities with no apparent military target nearby. Houthi rebels, who have been the main target of Saudi Arabia's five-month military campaign in Yemen, were not in the immediate area at the time, according to Ibrahim al-Razoom, the owner of the plant.The airstrikes transformed the factory in Hajja Province, in the north, into ""ruins"" and wounded at least 11 other people, he said.The Saudi-led coalition rarely acknowledges whether its airstrikes have hit civilian targets. A coalition spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asseri, told the Reuters news agency on Sunday that the plant had been used by the Houthis to make explosive devices and was not, in fact, a bottling factory.The coalition has recently intensified its bombing of Hajja and other parts of Yemen bordering Saudi Arabia in response to more aggressive cross-border attacks by the Houthis. The airstrikes -- including an intense barrage late Saturday and early Sunday in the city of Abs, in Hajja Province -- are part of a broader escalation of fighting across the country that has prompted dire warnings from aid groups.The charity group Save the Children issued a statement on Sunday warning that one of the main pediatric hospitals in the capital, Sana, faced imminent closure because of fuel shortages and a lack of medical supplies caused by fighting and the ""de facto"" blockade of Yemen by the Saudi-led coalition. The hospital, called Al-Sabeen, serves roughly three million people, the group said.Hospital staff members told Save the Children that Al-Sabeen had run out of critical supplies, including anesthetics, blood transfusion tests and food for severely malnourished children, and that it had enough fuel to run generators for only two days.""Should they be forced to close, hundreds of children currently admitted will stop receiving treatment,"" the group said.",1.0
Turkey Launches Its First Airstrikes of ISIS Campaign:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISTANBUL -- Turkey has launched its first wave of airstrikes as part of the United States-led coalition to fight the Islamic State, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement Saturday.Turkish fighter jets carried out joint operations against Islamic State targets in Syria late Friday, which posed a threat to Turkey's national security, the statement said.Islamic State militants gained control of five villages in northern Syria on Thursday and advanced toward the Turkish border, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group.The attack comes weeks after Turkey took a major tactical shift by assuming a more active role in the campaign against the Islamic militant group, plunging into direct cross-border confrontations and allowing American warplanes to use its air bases.Until now, Turkey, a NATO member and longtime ally of the United States, had been unwilling to take a direct stance against the group, mainly out of concern over retaliation.Since shifting gears, however, Turkey has come under criticism for lagging in its engagement and prioritizing its renewed military operations against a Kurdish insurgency group in Turkey and Northern Iraq, a group that has nonetheless been one of the most effective in fighting the Islamic State on the ground.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter of the United States called on Ankara last week to participate fully in the American-led campaign against the group and increase security measures across its border with Syria.Mr. Carter said Turkey needed to join in the airstrike campaign, adding, ""They need to work more on controlling their border. And we've made that clear.""Turkish officials have rejected accusations that they have been reluctant to join international efforts to fight the Islamic State, and insist the delay is because of lengthy discussions on logistics and technical operations.Those talks were concluded last week, according to the Foreign Ministry, which said Ankara would coordinate with coalition nations on airstrikes.""The fight against the terrorist organization is a priority for Turkey,"" the statement said.",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; Pakistan: Civilians Killed as Troops Trade Fire With India in Kashmir:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan and India on Friday accused each other of targeting civilians in the latest deadly exchange of cross-border fire, as relations continued to worsen just days after talks between top security officials of both countries were canceled.Pakistan's military said that at least eight civilians had been killed and at least 47 wounded by Indian fire in the eastern Sialkot region of Pakistan. In response, the country's Army chief visited the border area and accused India of ""terrorizing the civilian population,"" according to a spokesman.At the same time, Indian officials said that at least three civilians had been killed by Pakistani fire across the border. Neither country reported any military casualties in the fighting.Relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbors have plummeted recently as each side accused the other of border violations and instigating terrorism.India has long accused Pakistan of supporting separatist militants in the disputed Kashmir region, and Pakistan has leveled allegations that India is aiding separatist rebels in Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan Province.Last week, talks between the national security advisers of both countries, scheduled to be held in New Delhi, were canceled after sharp disagreements emerged over Pakistani plans to meet with Kashmiri leaders in New Delhi. India said the Kashmiri meeting was not acceptable, and Pakistani officials responded by pulling out of the security talks.""It has been apparent that neither the Modi government nor the Pakistan military are particularly keen on stabilizing the bilateral relationship,"" said Cyril Almeida, an editor at the Pakistani news publication Dawn, referring to the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi.The Sialkot region has been particularly volatile for the past year; troops from both sides have repeatedly traded fire there.

Iran's Navy Blasts Away at a Mock U.S. Carrier:   [Foreign Desk ],,"TEHRAN -- Iran's navy may pale in comparison to that of the United States, but on Wednesday it inflicted serious damage on an American aircraft carrier -- a mock-up of one, to be exact.The replica, which seemed to have been built on top of a barge, took some nasty hits, just as a real carrier would in a real war situation, Iranian commanders boasted.""A unique power has been created, and we do not like to put it into practice,"" Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the highest commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, told the local news media. ""But if, God forbid, such a day comes, Iran's navy will have the complete control over the Sea of Oman, the Hormuz Strait and the Persian Gulf.""The simulation, called Great Prophet 9, was the centerpiece of an exercise by the naval branch of the Revolutionary Guards, and it was carried out in the vicinity of the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic waterway through which more than 20 percent of the world's oil passes.State television showed images of missiles striking a ""ship"" resembling a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, similar to the ones permanently patrolling the blue waters of the Persian Gulf. Enveloped in smoke, the ersatz warship was swarmed by dozens of Iranian speedboats, as a presenter described the types of missiles, torpedoes and rockets blowing holes in its sides.Military officials could be heard shouting ""praise the lord"" each time the replica was hit.""That is the Fateh-110 missile hitting its target,"" the presenter said, as more smoke belched from the fake aircraft carrier. ""God will guide those who fight in line with his wishes,"" he added, quoting a line from the Quran.Though Iran and the United States are engaged in nuclear talks, Iran has often threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation for any attack on its nuclear sites.Wednesday's make-believe attack is part of Iran's strategy to show military might, despite being engaged in direct talks with its archenemy, the United States.The United States' presence in the Persian Gulf has long vexed Iran's leaders, who have said there is no reason for the American Navy to project power so far from its borders. In addition, Iranian officers say, its very presence presents a danger to the region.""American aircraft carriers are very big ammunition depots housing a lot of missiles, rockets, torpedoes and everything else,"" the Revolutionary Guards' navy chief, Adm. Ali Fadavi, said on state television, adding that a direct hit by a missile could set off a large secondary explosion. Last month, Admiral Fadavi said his force was capable of sinking American aircraft carriers in the event of war.The mock carrier bore a striking resemblance to a model that the United States military noticed when it was under construction in a shipyard in the port of Bandar Abbas last year. It quickly became known as the Target Barge. The United States did not seem overly concerned about the exercise or the implied threat to its carriers.""We are aware of a recent exercise by Iranian naval forces involving a mock-up of a vessel similar to an aircraft carrier,"" said Cmdr. Elissa Smith, a Defense Department spokeswoman. ""We are confident in our naval forces' ability to defend themselves against any maritime threat.""Cmdr. Kevin Stephens, the spokesman for the Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, echoed that confidence, adding in remarks to The Associated Press, ""It seems they've attempted to destroy the equivalent of a Hollywood movie set.""",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; China: Airstrip Being Built on Reef:   [Foreign Desk ],,"BEIJING -- New satellite images show that China has started construction of an airstrip on a third artificial island in the South China Sea that will strengthen Beijing's military capacity in the contested waters, Western analysts say.The photographs, released by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, show preparation for airfields on Mischief Reef and Subi Reef, submerged reefs in the contested Spratly Islands that China has transformed into islands, according to the center.The airstrip on Mischief Reef is about 20 miles from a small Philippine military garrison on an existing tiny island and will put the installation under great pressure, said James Hardy, Asia-Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defense Weekly.That airstrip will most likely be used for turboprop patrol, but it could easily be equipped for ""full military action"" if needed, Mr. Hardy said. The most important function of the strip, he said, will be as yet another site for Chinese listening devices and early warning radar, much like the technology being installed on Woody Island in the Paracel Islands of the South China Sea, which are also contested. Evidence of that will probably appear soon on Mischief Reef, he said.China completed a 10,000-foot runway several months ago on Fiery Cross Island, one of five artificial islands it has created in a large reclamation project in the South China Sea this year.The South China Sea is one of the top areas of disagreement between China and the United States that will be discussed during a state visit by President Xi Jinping to Washington next week.The Obama administration has called on China to stop land reclamation, construction and militarization of South China Sea outposts, a policy that Washington calls the ""three noes.""Washington has expressed concern that the military capacity on the reclaimed islands will interfere with freedom of navigation in the area, one of the world's busiest waterways. With these military runways, the zone of competition between the United States and China across the South China Sea has expanded significantly, experts say.But China has rebuffed Washington, repeatedly saying that it has ""indisputable sovereignty"" over about 80 percent of the South China Sea and the right to build what it wants on the Spratly and Paracel archipelagoes.In June, China's Foreign Ministry said Beijing would stop reclamation on the five artificial islands but would continue to build facilities on them. At the time of the statement, Beijing appeared to have finished much of the reclamation carried out by large flotillas of dredges.After a speech to Chinese and Western journalists in Beijing on Tuesday, Yang Xiyu, a senior fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, said ""difficulties between the United States and China on the South China Sea will continue for a long time.""There is little chance, he said, that the sharp differences will be resolved at the meeting between Mr. Xi and President Obama. The best that can be expected is a ""consensus"" to manage the differences, he said.In April, when satellite images showed that China was building the 10,000-foot runway on Fiery Cross, 170 miles west of Mischief Reef, American military analysts called the installation a strategic game changer. The size of the runway meant a fighter jet could land on the island, they said.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
"American Attack Killed Aide to Islamic State Leader, U.S. Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"WASHINGTON -- A deputy to the leader of the Islamic State was killed in an American airstrike in Iraq this week, the White House announced Friday.The militant, Fadhil Ahmad al-Hayali, also known as Hajji Mutazz, was killed on Tuesday while traveling in a vehicle near Mosul, according to a statement from the National Security Council. The Obama administration described Mr. Hayali as the Islamic State's ""Baghdad military emir and the emir of Ninawa Province.""Mr. Hayali has been declared dead before, including as recently as December 2014. ""This time we are 100 percent certain,"" said a senior official with the American-led coalition that is fighting the Islamic State. ""We have multiple confirmations he was in the car at the moment of the strike.""An Islamic State media operative known as Abu Abdullah was also killed in the airstrike, officials said.The administration said that Mr. Hayali was a member of the Islamic State's shura council, or cabinet, and was the senior deputy to the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He was a primary coordinator for moving large amounts of explosives, weapons, vehicles and people between Iraq and Syria, the administration said, and he supported Islamic State operations in both countries.Coalition officials said that on Aug. 3, 2014, Mr. Hayali led an offensive on Sinjar Mountain in northern Iraq, the traditional home of the Yazidi religious minority.The killing of Mr. Hayali -- who a Defense Department official said helped plan the group's successful offensive in Mosul last June -- struck a blow to the Islamic State's operations, the administration said, ""given that his influence spanned ISIL's finance, media, operations and logistics."" ISIL is an acronym for the Islamic State.The United States and its coalition partners have for months been conducting airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria. In Iraq, where the Islamic State has taken control of a number of cities and towns like Mosul and Ramadi, American war planes have targeted senior leaders as part of what the White House calls its effort to ""degrade and destroy"" the militant group.Since the airstrikes began last year, the United States military has killed several of Mr. Baghdadi's deputies, including the militant group's conduit for outreach to extremists in North Africa and a middle-level Islamic State leader who Pentagon officials described as the group's ""emir of oil and gas.""After most of the targeted killings, however, the operatives have been replaced fairly quickly, and Pentagon officials acknowledged that that would probably be the case again. ""This is not Baghdadi,"" one Defense Department official said. Counterterrorism experts said that the Islamic State had created an organic structure that inures it to the death of any single leader.Like several other Islamic State leaders, Mr. Hayali served in the military of Saddam Hussein, and was purged after the United States-led invasion, according to Will McCants, a scholar of militant Islam at the Brookings Institution. Mr. Hayali later joined Al Qaeda in Iraq, and was arrested and incarcerated at Camp Bucca in Iraq, where Mr. Baghdadi, the self-described caliph of the Islamic State, was also detained.Mr. Hayali ""rose through the Islamic State's ranks with Baghdadi, so the caliph has lost a capable and trusted lieutenant, if the report of his death is true,"" Mr. McCants said in an email.",1.0
"Airstrikes Kill Dozens of Civilians in Yemen, Aid Group Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"Doctors Without Borders said Friday that Saudi-led airstrikes on a residential district in Yemen's southwestern city of Taiz had killed more than 65 civilians, including 17 people from one family.If confirmed, it would be one of the largest tolls from airstrikes by Saudi Arabia and its military coalition partners since they began bombing Yemen five months ago in a campaign to crush the Houthi insurgency in the country.Witnesses in Taiz said the airstrikes started at about 9:30 p.m. on Thursday and destroyed more than 17 buildings in the city's Sala district. By the next morning, residents were still searching through the rubble with their bare hands to find survivors, Salah Dongu'du, the coordinator in Taiz for Doctors Without Borders, the medical charity, said in an interview.Nasser al-Qadasi, a resident, said, ""It was mass destruction.""The airstrikes were part of a new outbreak of fighting over the past few days in Taiz, Yemen's second-largest city and one of the country's most heavily contested battlefields during the current conflict.The Houthis, who have suffered a string of defeats in southern Yemen over the last few weeks, including in Taiz, had been shelling the city for the past two days, according to Rashad al-Shara'abi, a spokesman for the local anti-Houthi forces.The airstrikes silenced the Houthi artillery, he said. But at least five of the Saudi coalition's bombs also struck Sala, the residential area. Ali al-Sarari, a local human rights activist whose house was damaged in the strikes, said that ""many people lost their entire family.""More than 4,000 people have been killed in Yemen since the fighting between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis began in late March, including hundreds of civilians killed in airstrikes.

"North and South Korea Trade Fire Across Border, Seoul Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SEOUL, South Korea -- The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered his front-line military units to go on a ""semi-war state"" on Friday after South Korea said the two Koreas had exchanged rocket and artillery fire in the first major armed clash across their border in five years.No casualties were immediately reported from the exchange of fire that took place across one of the world's most heavily armed borders on Thursday. But tensions remained high on Friday, as Mr. Kim ordered his front-line units to be prepared to attack South Korean loudspeakers along the border unless they stopped blaring propaganda broadcasts by Saturday evening.South Korea, currently in the middle of large-scale joint military exercises with the United States, rejected the North Korean demand. Instead it stepped up its own military vigilance, vowing to retaliate against any provocations from the North.Mr. Kim ordered all front-line units to go on a ""semi-war state,"" one of his country's highest military alerts, from 5 p.m. Friday during an emergency meeting of his Central Military Commission, the north's official Korean Central News Agency said on Friday.North Korea issued the same sort of alert in 1968, when it hijacked the American spy ship Pueblo, and in 1993, when the standoff with Washington over its nuclear weapons program first flared.""Commanders were appointed and dispatched to the relevant sectors of the front to command military actions"" to destroy the South Korean loudspeakers and counter possible retaliations from the South, the North's news agency said. The front-line units ""should enter a wartime state to be fully battle ready to launch surprise operations,"" it added.The Kim regime has frequently issued bellicose statements, claiming that the divided Korean Peninsula was ""on the brink of war"" whenever the United States and South Korea conduct one of their joint annual war games, which it called rehearsals for invasion. But the latest threat followed a highly unusual exchange of artillery shells across the two Koreas' land border.South Korean military radar detected what appeared to be a North Korean rocket landing in Yeoncheon County, near the border north of Seoul, at 3:52 p.m. Thursday, the Defense Ministry said in a brief statement.Twenty minutes later, the North carried out another attack, said Col. Jeon Ha-gyu, a South Korean military spokesman. The South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted unnamed military sources as saying that the second attack involved several rounds from a 76.2-millimeter direct-fire weapon.South Korea responded by firing ""dozens"" of shells from a 155-millimeter artillery unit, targeting the rocket's launching point in the North, the ministry said.""Our military raised its vigilance to the highest level and is closely watching the movement of the North Korean military, ready to respond strongly and decisively to any further provocations from the North,"" Colonel Jeon said.About 220 people from two villages in Yeoncheon were evacuated into underground shelters, said Hong Seong-beom, a county official. Mr. Hong said there were no immediate reports of damage.North Korea said the South fired 36 artillery shells across the border, some of them falling near its guard posts but not causing injuries, the headquarters of the North's military, known as the People's Army, said in a statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency.North Korea denied the first rocket attack but did not comment on what South Korea said was a second attack. ""This reckless provocative mania should never go unpunished,"" the North said, reporting the emergency meeting of its Central Military Commission.The North's attacks followed repeated threats to attack the loudspeakers that South Korea had turned on along the border last week to broadcast propaganda.President Park Geun-hye convened an emergency meeting of the South's National Security Council on Thursday and ordered the military to ""deal resolutely with any North Korean provocations,"" said her spokesman, Min Kyung-wook.The exchange of fire was the first serious armed clash between the countries since North Korea carried out an artillery attack on a South Korean border island in 2010, killing two marines and two civilians. At the time, South Korea retaliated by pounding gun positions in the North.In recent years, the two sides have exchanged minor fire, mostly harmless warning shots, across their border. In May of last year, a North Korean patrol boat fired two rounds of artillery, which fell 490 feet from a South Korean Navy ship in waters near a disputed western sea border. The South's ship responded by firing several rounds of its own.Tensions have been on the rise along the countries' heavily armed 155-mile border since Aug. 4, when two South Korean border guards were seriously wounded by land mines that the South said were planted by the North. North Korea has denied planting the mines.In retaliation, South Korea last week began using loudspeakers along the border to broadcast propaganda messages into North Korea, a tactic dating from the Cold War that had not been used in 11 years. The North turned on propaganda loudspeakers of its own, and it threatened to attack South Korea's.""The fact that the North only launched one rocket without hitting any South Korean loudspeaker indicates that the North meant it as a warning,"" said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University in Seoul.Mr. Koh said that the North was unlikely to escalate the exchange of fire into a major skirmish, given the large-scale joint military exercise -- called Ulchi-Freedom Guardian -- that the United States and South Korea kicked off this week.But Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said that the situation could deteriorate if the two sides persisted in ""their confrontational posture in which one side's show of strength is matched by the other side's tough stance.""The Koreas are technically at war, the 1950-53 Korean War having ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.Photograph South Koreans at a Shelter in Yeoncheon County On Thursday.

"Attacks, and Accusations, Escalate in Eastern Ukraine:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"MOSCOW -- Fighting between government forces and Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine has escalated sharply in recent days, with each side blaming the other for the violence.At least nine people were killed in artillery strikes on Monday in villages and towns on both sides of a cease-fire line, and United States officials have said that one three-day period of fighting along the front last week was the most intense since a February cease-fire.Neither side has openly renounced the cease-fire, but European monitors of the accord say both have been pulling heavy weapons out of storage sites and putting them to use.The United States State Department blamed Russia and pro-Russian rebels for the uptick in violence. American officials have characterized the fighting as possibly a new attempt by Russia to destabilize the Ukrainian government.""Russia and the separatists are launching these attacks, just as they escalated the conflict last August,"" the department's spokesman, John Kirby, told reporters in Washington. ""Efforts by Russia and separatists to grab more territory will be met with further costs.""President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Tuesday blamed Ukraine. After emerging from a dive in a miniature submarine in the Black Sea off the coast of Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed last year, Mr. Putin said that, ""regrettably, we are now seeing this conflict escalation and the blame lies not with the Donbas militia but with the rival side.""Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said on Monday that the Ukrainian authorities had failed to carry out the political points of the February cease-fire, which he said called for Kiev to cede power to the two separatist regions.The Ukrainians, he said, are ""more concerned over how to keep alive Russophobia in the West and how to artificially whip up tension.""Before the latest escalation, four vehicles belonging to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe were burned outside the Park Inn hotel in Donetsk, limiting the group's ability to monitor rebel military actions.Ivica Dacic, the foreign minister of Serbia, which holds the chairmanship of the O.S.C.E., issued a statement last week condemning the arsons and subsequent resumption of fighting, at the time focused around one village, Starohnativka, northeast of the strategic Ukrainian-controlled port of Mariupol.Since then, skirmishes have become general along the length of the front, the European monitoring mission's statements suggest.On Saturday, European monitors reported hearing 184 explosions in Donetsk that were consistent with mortar fire on the front that runs through the city's outlying northwestern districts. South of Donetsk, along a river that roughly defines the front line, monitors found fresh craters from howitzers and rocket artillery on both sides.On the government side, monitors noted that the Ukrainian Army had removed eight Grad rocket-launching trucks from a holding area, where they had been taken to comply with the cease-fire.The separatist news agency DAN reported that artillery fire killed three people in the town of Horlivka and two in Donetsk.The Ukrainian Army reported that one soldier was killed in the fighting, and officials said that two people were killed overnight Monday from shelling in a Ukrainian-held village on the outskirts of Mariupol. A third resident of the village, a mother who had been caught in the open with her 10-year-old daughter while running for cover, died on Tuesday in a hospital.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"Piling Sand in a Disputed Sea, China Literally Gains Ground:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"WASHINGTON -- The clusters of Chinese vessels busily dredge white sand and pump it onto partly submerged coral, aptly named Mischief Reef, transforming it into an island.Over a matter of weeks, satellite photographs show the island growing bigger, its few shacks on stilts replaced by buildings. What appears to be an amphibious warship, capable of holding 500 to 800 troops, patrols the reef's southern opening.China has long asserted ownership of the archipelago in the South China Sea known as the Spratly Islands, also claimed by at least three other countries, including the Philippines, an American ally. But the series of detailed photographs taken of Mischief Reef shows the remarkable speed, scale and ambition of China's effort to literally gain ground in the dispute.The photographs show that since January, China has been dredging enormous amounts of sand from around the reef and using it to build up land mass -- what military analysts at the Pentagon are calling ""facts on the water"" -- hundreds of miles from the Chinese mainland.The Chinese have clearly concluded that it is unlikely anyone will challenge them in an area believed rich in oil and gas and, perhaps more important, strategically vital. Last week Adm. Harry Harris, the commander of the United States Pacific fleet, accused China of undertaking an enormous and unprecedented artificial land creation operation.""China is creating a great wall of sand with dredges and bulldozers,"" Admiral Harris said in a speech in Canberra, Australia.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, on his first trip to Asia, put the American concerns in more diplomatic language, but the message was the same. In an interview to coincide with his visit, published Wednesday in the Yomiuri Shimbun, one of Japan's largest dailies, Mr. Carter said China's actions ""seriously increase tensions and reduce prospects for diplomatic solutions"" in territory claimed by the Philippines and Vietnam, and indirectly by Taiwan.He urged Beijing to ""limit its activities and exercise restraint to improve regional trust."" That is the same diplomatic message the Obama administration has been giving to China since Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the secretary of state, and her Chinese counterpart faced off over the issue at an Asian summit meeting in 2010.While other countries in Southeast Asia, like Malaysia and Vietnam, have used similar techniques to extend or enlarge territory, none have China's dredging and construction power.The new satellite photographs were taken by DigitalGlobe, a commercial satellite imagery provider, and analyzed by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington research group. They certainly confirm the worries expressed by both Mr. Carter and Admiral Harris.""China's building activities at Mischief Reef are the latest evidence that Beijing's land reclamation is widespread and systematic,"" said Mira Rapp-Hooper, director of the center's Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, a website devoted to monitoring activity on the disputed territory.The transformation of Mischief Reef, which the Chinese call Meiji Reef, she said, is within territory claimed by the Philippines and is one of seven small outposts the Chinese have sought to establish in the South China Sea. ""These will allow Beijing to conduct regular, sustained patrols of the airspace and water, and to attempt to press its far-flung maritime claims as many as 1,000 miles from its shores,"" she said.Although these outposts are too vulnerable for China to use in wartime, she said, ""they could certainly allow it to exert significant pressure on other South China Sea claimants, such as the Philippines and Vietnam.""The issue poses a problem for the Obama administration, not simply because the Philippines is a treaty ally. China is working so quickly that its assertion of sovereignty could become a fait accompli before anything can be done to stop it.The United States has long insisted that the territorial disputes be resolved peacefully, and that no claimant should interfere with international navigation or take steps that impede a diplomatic resolution of the issue. But to the Chinese -- already flexing muscle in other territorial disputes and with the creation of an Asian infrastructure bank to challenge the Western-created World Bank -- this is not a matter for negotiation.When Mrs. Clinton raised the issue in Hanoi five years ago at the Asian Regional Forum, her Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, responded with a 25-minute speech, exclaiming: ""China is a big country. Bigger than any other countries here."" It seemed to be a reminder that its military could make sure no one would dare challenge its building spree on disputed territory -- and so far, no one has, other than with diplomatic protests.Since then, China has made no secret of its territorial designs on the Spratlys, creating at least three new islands that could serve as bases for Chinese surveillance and as resupply stations for navy vessels, according to IHS Jane's.Satellite imagery of the Spratlys publicized by IHS Jane's in November showed how the Chinese had created an island about 9,850 feet long and 985 feet wide on Fiery Cross Reef, about 200 miles west of Mischief Reef, with a harbor capable of docking warships. IHS Jane's said the new island could support a runway for military aircraft.The United States is about to conduct a joint military exercise with the Philippines, part of an emerging Obama administration strategy to keep American ships traversing the area regularly, a way of pushing back on Chinese claims of exclusive rights. The administration did the same when China declared an air defense zone in the region more than a year ago.The Chinese have said they consider most of the South China Sea to be rightfully theirs -- a claim others make as well. China and Japan have a separate territorial dispute over islands that Japan calls the Senkaku and China calls the Diaoyutai. Those tensions have eased slightly in recent times.Last year, China and Vietnam became entangled in an angry exchange after China towed a $1 billion oil drilling rig to an area 150 miles off Vietnam's coast. On Tuesday China's official Xinhua news agency reported that the leaders of both countries wanted to soothe their differences and ""control their disputes to ensure that the bilateral relationship will develop in a right track.""",1.0
French Commandos Free Dutchman Held by Al Qaeda's North African Branch:   [Foreign Desk ],,"PARIS -- A Dutch citizen held captive in the Sahara for more than three years by the North African branch of Al Qaeda was freed on Monday by French special forces, who mounted a rescue operation without knowing whom they were trying to save.French commandos raided a terrorist camp in northern Mali at 5 a.m., killed the fighters there after an exchange of gunfire and found Sjaak Rijke, the Dutch hostage, said Col. Gilles Jaron, a spokesman for the French Army's chief of staff.""This was an operation that was carried out with the knowledge that a high-value person was there, though we had not completely determined his identity,"" Colonel Jaron said. ""We knew it was someone very important, and we knew we were mounting a rescue operation.""Mr. Rijke, a former railroad conductor, was abducted from the hotel where he was staying in Timbuktu, the Malian desert city, on Nov. 25, 2011. He was freed on Monday from a camp near Tessalit, one of the northernmost towns in Mali, in an area that has served at least since 2006 as a base for Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the African branch.The commandos took Mr. Rijke to a French military base in Tessalit, where he was declared to be ""safe and sound,"" according to a statement from the French Defense Ministry. France has 3,000 military personnel in Mali and Chad as part of the so-called Barkhane military operation aimed at containing advances by Qaeda-linked Islamic extremists in northwestern Africa.Mr. Rijke had been visiting Timbuktu on an adventure tour of northern Mali along with a small group of other Europeans, including citizens of Germany, Britain and Sweden, when he was seized in 2011. They had arrived by motorcycle and four-wheel-drive vehicle and were staying at a small budget hotel on the edge of the city, according to Mahane Toure, a hotel owner in the town. He said the group was drinking soft drinks inside the hotel when gunmen burst in.The extremists herded Mr. Rijke; Johan Gustafsson, a Swede; and a third man into a truck at gunpoint. Jihadists in Mali have identified the third hostage, who has British and South African citizenship, as Stephen Malcolm. Family members gave his name as Stephen Malcolm McGown in an interview they gave to a South African media outlet.A German tourist who refused to get in the truck was killed on the spot. When the police arrived some 40 minutes later, all they found was the German's body and a stain of blood in the sand.One member of the touring group escaped harm, a European woman who has been identified in news reports as Mr. Rijke's wife. She was inside a tent she had set up on the hotel grounds when the assailants burst into the hotel. She managed to go unnoticed.Mr. Malcolm and Mr. Gustafsson were not found during the raid on Monday. They are presumed to still be hostages.The abduction put an end to tourism in Timbuktu, said Mr. Toure, who owns the Hotel Colombe, the largest hotel in the city. ""It was as if the sky had turned itself inside out,"" he said. ""No one came to Timbuktu after that.""Mr. Rijke was known to be in the hands of the Furqan Battalion of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The group issued a ""proof of life"" video last November showing Mr. Rijke bearded and emaciated, according to Jean-Paul Rouiller, director of the Geneva Center for the Training and Analysis of Terrorism.Intelligence officials in Bamako, the capital of Mali, as well as in Europe said that the ambassadors of the Netherlands, Britain, South Africa and Sweden had been meeting biweekly seeking a way to free the hostages. But the talks were stalled because none of the governments were willing to pay the millions of dollars the group was demanding for their release.Ransom payments have become a main source of financing for Al Qaeda and its direct affiliates, which have obtained at least $125 million through kidnappings since 2008, most of it paid by European governments or their proxies, according to an investigation by The New York Times.""He is one lucky man,"" one European intelligence official said of Mr. Rijke. The official asked not to be named in order to discuss classified information. ""There was a Ping-Pong going on between the different services"" of the four nations over the issue of ransom, the official said. ""He was found by a sheer piece of luck.""The Dutch foreign minister, Bert Koenders, expressed relief at the news of Mr. Rijke's liberation, saying he was ""happy and relieved that this terrible period of uncertainty and sadness has been brought to an end.""",1.0
"Bulgaria Puts Up a New Wall, but This One Keeps People Out:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"LESOVO, Bulgaria -- Less than two decades after the painstaking removal of a massive border fence designed to keep people in, Bulgarian authorities are just as painstakingly building a new fence along the rugged Turkish border, this time to keep people out.Faced with a surge of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa -- and the risk that they include jihadis intent on terrorist attacks -- Europe is bolstering its defenses on many fronts, including this formerly Communist country, which little more than a quarter-century ago was more concerned with stanching the outbound flow of its own citizens to freedom. For the past 16 months, Bulgaria has been carrying out a plan that would sound familiar to anyone along the United States-Mexico frontier: more border officers, new surveillance equipment and the first 20-mile section of its border fence, which was finished in September.The hardening of the Bulgaria-Turkey border is one very visible manifestation of the agitation across the continent about the economic, social and political ramifications of the surge in immigration. With warmer weather fast approaching and more refugees likely to be on the move, nations along Europe's southern tier are beefing up border staffing, adding sensors and other technical barriers, expanding refugee facilities, and building walls.More than 200,000 refugees are known to have penetrated Europe's land and sea borders last year, not including those who were able to sneak through undetected.And the numbers for the first two months of this year, when Europe enjoyed its second mild winter in a row, were up sharply compared with the same period last year.Anti-immigrant sentiment is increasing in Britain, France, Hungary, the Czech Republic and elsewhere across the continent. Parties espousing ethnic nationalism are seeing their support rise, some to the point where they threaten the dominance of more traditional parties.""The rise of the right wing in Europe is a reaction to this refugee flow,"" said Boris B. Cheshirkov, chief spokesman in Bulgaria for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.And with much of Europe still struggling to recover from the 2008 financial crisis, the higher costs of caring for this flood of refugees -- especially in countries like Bulgaria, the poorest member of the European Union -- are straining national budgets.At the same time, episodes like the January attack on the Paris offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo are raising worries that both homegrown jihadists and foreign fighters will cloak themselves in this refugee flood.""Right now, in the western part of Turkey, on the borders of Greece and Bulgaria, you probably have thousands of Syrian refugees waiting for an occasion to cross,"" said Marc Pierini, an expert on Turkey and the Middle East at Carnegie Europe, a foreign policy analysis group. ""If you talk about returning jihadists, you are talking about dozens.""Slavcho Velkov, a Bulgarian security expert and university lecturer, said he believed there was more jihadist movement through Bulgaria than the authorities acknowledged.""I have seen such fighters here with my own eyes,"" he said. ""I spotted some at the central bus station and struck up a conversation. When I asked them where they were going, they said, 'We are going to heaven.' ""To some degree, efforts like the new Bulgarian fence simply contribute to a game of Whac-a-Mole: When one route is cut off, smugglers shift to other paths into Europe.""In 2012, heightened security was implemented along the Greek border with Turkey, including the building of a fence,"" said Gil Arias Fernández, deputy executive director of Frontex, the agency that coordinates border protection throughout the European Union. ""The result was that flow changed towards the Bulgarian border.""It was this deluge that caused Bulgaria to institute its own ""containment plan"" in November 2013, including the continuing construction of the border fence, which will eventually stretch 100 miles.The impact was dramatic. The number of known illegal crossings fell to about 4,000 in 2014 from 11,000 the previous year.But that did not mean that refugees were not getting into Europe, Mr. Fernández said. Those thousands who failed to cross into Bulgaria were offset by larger numbers crossing from Turkey by sea to the nearby Greek islands. Smaller numbers tried making it to Bulgaria across the Black Sea.More than 170,000 refugees -- most of them from the Middle East, Africa and Afghanistan -- entered Europe on the sea route to southern Italy in 2014. In the first two months of this year, the number was up 42 percent over the same period last year.Here in the eastern Mediterranean, where Frontex measures land and sea crossings into Bulgaria and Greece, the number of those entering is up 107 percent over last year -- with the raw number of those crossing, 5,275, approaching the 7,834 who used the Italian sea route.""We are expecting a surge of refugees in April and May for certain,"" said Jordan Malidov, director of a Bulgarian refugee center in the town of Harmanli, 22 miles north of the Turkish border. Warmer weather emboldens those trying risky sea crossings or attempting to walk across remote, green borders.""And it is common when there is war for the numbers to increase,"" he said.Back in the late 1990s, when Nikolay Radulov was a deputy minister of the interior, part of his job was overseeing the dismantling of the old wall, a Cold War relic that had been the southern edge of the Iron Curtain. It was actually two fences, stretching across the entire land border, with a 500-meter minefield between them, designed to prevent residents of Communist nations from sneaking into the West.The fence was dismantled piece by piece, he said, ""and we very carefully removed each of the mines, one by one.""Now, as a professor of national and international security at New Bulgarian University, Mr. Radulov is watching with some disbelief as the new barrier rises to take its place.""The theory then was that it was antidemocratic to have these kind of devices along the border,"" he said. ""And of course, we were good democrats.""The new fence is rising on a rocky ridge, below which a pencil-thin minaret pokes through the rooftops of Hamzabeyli village in a gentle elbow of northern Turkey's green hills.""We post the men 100 meters apart,"" said Hristo Stefanov, the chief of the border patrol office responsible for this stretch of the frontier, pointing down a rutted road toward a distant man in black. ""That way, you see, the officers are always in sight of one another.""Immediately behind him was the western end of the 12-foot-high metal fence that rolls along the stony hilltop until it disappears around a distant line of gnarled trees. The fence, on the Bulgarian side, consists of chicken wire in a steel frame, while a menacing cascade of razor wire climbs its Turkish face.Only this first section is in place, along the stretch where most refugees tried to avoid border checkpoints. But the Bulgarian government, drawing on money from the European Union and other sources, and eager to prove it can effectively control its southern flank, says it will begin later this month to extend the wall until it covers the entire 100-mile land border with Turkey not already blocked by the Rezovo River.One reason Bulgarian officials are keen to complete the wall is to demonstrate to European leaders that the country deserves to be admitted into the Schengen group of nations whose members do not require visas or passports to travel between them. Bulgaria was admitted to the European Union in 2007, but has been denied Schengen approval, partly because of border issues.Although the Bulgarian government contends that the wall will be finished this summer, few security experts believe this is possible. Construction has not begun, and roads must first be carved through the forbidding, often mountainous landscape.In the meantime, refugees will continue to find ways across the border at more remote and dangerous locations.About 4,000 refugees are living in centers like the one in Harmanli, which holds 1,600.Tahani Halad Hamza, 21, was studying biology in Mosul, Iraq, when the fighting erupted there. Her father was lost in the conflict, but she, her husband, her mother and two brothers managed to make it into Turkey and as far as the Bulgarian border, where they were taken into custody about six months ago.Now what is left of the family lives in a small, red-and-white trailer in the refugee center. Like others in the facility, they said they hoped to be granted official refugee status by the Bulgarian government, which would allow them to travel through Europe.Her family hopes to get to Germany, she said, or perhaps Britain.""The only difference between Bulgaria and Syria is the conflict,"" she said. ""There is no work in either place.""Her mother leaned forward with wide eyes, ""Syria,"" she said. ""Boom, boom, boom!""Photograph A New Fence Along 20 Miles of Bulgaria's Border with Turkey.

Apparent Saudi Strike Kills at Least Nine in Yemeni Family:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- At least nine people from a single family were killed when what appeared to be an airstrike by the Saudi-led military coalition struck a home in a village outside Sana, Yemen's capital, officials said Saturday.Village residents gave a higher toll, saying that as many as 11 members of the Okaish family, including five children, were killed in the bombing on Friday. The airstrike may have been intended for an air defense base about a mile and half away, a Yemen Interior Ministry official said.Bombings attributed to the coalition have killed dozens of civilians since the start of the Saudi-led air offensive intended to cripple the Houthis, a Yemeni militia that has gained control of Sana and other parts of Yemen in the past eight months.The Saudi intervention, which began in late March, has exacerbated the fighting in Yemen's civil conflict and effectively blockaded the country, starving cities and towns of essential supplies and making it increasingly difficult for civilians to flee.The latest deaths came as the United Nations Security Council was scheduled to meet in New York to discuss a Russian proposal for a 24-hour pause in the hostilities for humanitarian reasons. Echoing the Russian proposal, the International Committee of the Red Cross called on Saturday for an immediate suspension of the fighting, saying the humanitarian situation in Yemen was ""dire.""""Our relief supplies and surgical personnel must be allowed to enter the country and safely reach the worst-affected places to provide help,"" Robert Mardini, the head of the operations for the Red Cross in the Middle East, said in a statement. ""Otherwise, put starkly, many more people will die. For the wounded, their chances of survival depend on action within hours, not days.""Red Cross workers have been trying to send in supplies for several days, but have yet to receive clearance from the warring parties, the group said.The southern city of Aden, which has been the site of street fighting for weeks, desperately needs assistance, humanitarian workers say. The Red Cross said it had been trying, in vain, to send in a surgical team by sea. Over the past week, three volunteers with the Yemeni Red Crescent have been killed trying to evacuate wounded people.Aid agencies are also trying to get supplies to Sana, which has been bombarded nightly by Saudi warplanes. Saudi officials have promised investigations into errant airstrikes, while blaming the Houthis for civilian deaths, accusing them of putting fighters in populated areas.A resident of the village hit on Friday, Dhiyazan Mohammed Khalil, said that if the attack was a mistake, it was an especially egregious one because the base sits on a mountain and the village is in the valley below.",1.0
North Korea Moves Forces Amid Talks With South:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea had deployed twice as many artillery pieces as usual along the border with South Korea on Sunday, and most of its submarines had departed from their bases, as high-level talks between the two Koreas aimed at breaking a tense military standoff stretched into a third day on Monday.Negotiators from both sides resumed talks in the border village of Panmunjom on Sunday afternoon, and continued their haggling on Monday, after a marathon meeting on Saturday failed to reach a compromise over the terms under which South Korea would withdraw 11 batteries of propaganda loudspeakers from the border. The North calls the broadcasts by the speakers, which include criticism of its political system and its leader, Kim Jong-un, an ""act of war.""As the negotiators haggled, the North raised the stakes by moving more artillery forces to the front line, a South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman said, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.""We have also detected 70 percent of the North Korean submarines missing from their bases, and we are looking for their whereabouts,"" he said. ""This is a typical North Korean tactic of talking on one hand and brandishing military power on the other to try to force their way.""It is highly unusual for so many of the North's 70 known submarines to be away from their bases at once, officials here said. South Korea has been particularly sensitive about North Korean submarines after 46 sailors were killed in 2010 in the sinking of a South Korean Navy ship, which the South attributed to a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine.On Monday, President Park Geun-hye of South Korea said that there was ""no backing down"" in the border talks and that the South would continue its loudspeaker broadcasts unless the North apologized for its recent provocations.""In order to stop the repeating cycle of provocations and anxiety, we need a clear apology and commitment from the North that these things will not happen again,"" Ms. Park told a meeting with presidential aides, according to her office.The militaries of both Koreas have been on heightened alert since they exchanged artillery fire on Thursday in a dispute over the loudspeakers. Although no casualties were reported, the clash was the most serious in five years.Since taking office in 2011, Mr. Kim has striven to prove himself a worthy ""military first"" successor of his father and grandfather, both of whom ruled North Korea before him, by conducting nuclear and long-range missile tests. But his inexperience in managing crises has added to worries about the current standoff. Some analysts fear that his frequent executions of top officials might make top generals more prone to attempt armed provocations to prove their loyalty and to survive his reign.Before the talks began, the two sides had sounded as if they were about to clash militarily. The North put its front-line units on a ""semi-war"" footing, ordering them to be ready to launch ""strong military action,"" including attacks on the loudspeakers, unless South Korea removed the speakers by 5 p.m. on Saturday. The speakers, a Cold War-era tool of psychological warfare that had been retired for 11 years, were returned to the front line on Aug. 10 after two South Korean border guards were maimed six days earlier by land mines that the South said were planted by the North.The South demanded that the North first apologize for the planting of the mines, which the North denies. While the talks were underway, the loudspeakers continued blaring propaganda.""What we see is the two Koreas challenging each other's nerve, going soft and tough at the same time,"" said Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul, the South Korean capital.The Koreas agreed to talk on Saturday hours before the 5 p.m. deadline for removal of the speakers passed. The sides have often escalated tensions, matching threats of war with tough talk of retaliation before retreating into dialogue and short-lived deals on improving ties.",1.0
"Arab Coalition Bombs Yemen's Capital, Killing Dozens:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SANA, Yemen -- A Saudi-led military coalition bombarded government buildings and residential neighborhoods in Sana, the Yemeni capital, overnight on Saturday, killing more than two dozen people, officials and witnesses said, and destroying homes in Sana's Old City, a Unesco World Heritage site.The Saudi coalition, which includes nine other Arab nations and is supported by the United States, began fighting Yemen's Houthi rebels in March, two months after the Houthis drove the government from power and took control of Sana. Coalition warplanes have sharply intensified their bombing of Sana in recent weeks, leading analysts to speculate that the airstrikes are intended to ease the way for a coalition ground incursion of the capital.The airstrikes hit the headquarters of the Interior Ministry and a military honor guard, killing at least 17 security and military personnel, according to government officials and witnesses. But several of the targets appeared to have no military value, witnesses said.One set of airstrikes crushed a group of houses, killing at least 10 members of one family and destroying at least two other houses, all in the Old City, which has been inhabited for more than 2,500 years.Other bombs struck an underpass, damaging a passing truck, as well as a four-story residential building.The aerial campaign has helped coalition forces advance in parts of Yemen, but has been marked by a persistent imprecision that has led to the deaths of more than a thousand civilians, according to human rights groups. The warplanes have bombed homes, markets, refugee camps and hospitals, but the coalition has consistently refused to acknowledge any culpability for the deaths.Errant airstrikes have become so frequent that critics of the coalition say they are part of a deliberate policy intended to terrorize the population and turn public opinion against the Houthis.On Friday, Unicef said that an airstrike in Dhamar, south of the capital, had destroyed a warehouse the agency used for water supplies, imperiling more than 11,000 people. Last week, the United Nations human rights chief called for an independent inquiry into violations by the coalition, as well as by the Houthi rebels.The bombing was the second major attack on the Old City since the start of the war in March. Around 11:30 p.m. on Friday, bombs destroyed the Ayni home, killing the family and damaging wells and several other homes in the area, according to Taha al-Maghribi, a neighbor. Mr. Maghribi said he had no idea why the family had been targeted: The father, Hifthallah al-Ayni, had no connection to either of the warring parties, he said, and the house was far from any military or security installation.Near the site of another attack that wounded two people in a four-story building, Hisham Abu Oraig, a neighbor, said a nearby government building could have been the target. ""But I don't think so,"" he added. ""The bombs are precise. They just want to scare people off.""",1.0
Turkish Forces Cross Into Syria on a Rescue Mission:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CORRECTION APPENDED. ISTANBUL -- The Turkish Army sent armored troops deep into Syria late Saturday to recover the remains of a major historical figure and to evacuate the guards at his besieged tomb, the prime minister announced in a televised news conference on Sunday.The tomb of Suleyman Shah, grandfather of the founder of the Ottoman Empire, is 20 miles south of the Turkish border, but it has been considered Turkish territory under a 1921 treaty with France, which ruled Syria at that time. Fighters from the Islamic State extremist group have controlled the surrounding area and have kept the Turkish soldiers there trapped for months, although they did not assault the tomb.The prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said there were no clashes during the mission and only one casualty, a soldier who was killed in an accident.He said Turkey notified the Syrian government, rebel leaders and the coalition forces fighting the Islamic State about the operation. It appeared to be Turkey's first significant ground incursion into Syria since the civil war there began almost four years ago.Mr. Davutoglu said 572 troops, 39 tanks, 57 armored vehicles and 100 other vehicles were involved, and that the column reached the tomb shortly after midnight.""A religious ceremony was held for the transfer of the tomb remains, while other items of cultural significance were removed with similar care,"" he said. ""Our troops were safely removed from the area."" Finally, he said, the Turkish flag was lowered, and the tomb and security station were destroyed to prevent any possible use by extremists.The Turkish Foreign Ministry said the operation was prompted by the chaos and instability in Syria. The Turkish news channel NTV reported that the government had received warnings in recent days that clashes were likely to erupt nearby between forces of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and Kurdish troops known as pesh merga, and that the tomb could become a target.""The Suleyman Shah tomb has been a point of vulnerability for Turkey for a long time, and with this operation, such weakness has been eliminated,"" said Sinan Ulgen, the chairman of the Istanbul-based Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies and a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels. ""The Islamic State could have used the presence of the tomb as leverage in case of any confrontation with Turkey.""Mr. Davutoglu said that, in accordance with the 1921 treaty, a new tomb for Suleyman Shah was being established in a part of Syria that is under Kurdish control, the Ashme district in the Rojava region. Turkish television showed images on Sunday of the Turkish flag being raised there.Suleyman Shah, who died in 1236, is believed to have drowned in the Euphrates River, which flows south from Turkey through Syria and into Iraq. His tomb by the banks of the river has been relocated several times before, most recently in the 1970s to avoid being submerged by the reservoir of a new dam. Mr. Davutoglu said that when conditions in Syria permitted, the tomb would be moved back again to the site that was evacuated, near the village of Karakozak.Tensions have mounted around the tomb since March, when the Islamic State took control of the surrounding area and began threatening to destroy the tomb unless guards there lowered the Turkish flag.The militant group raided Turkey's consulate in Mosul, Iraq, last June and seized 46 Turks and three Iraqis as hostages; they were released three months later on terms that were not disclosed.That crisis discouraged Turkey from joining the United States-led military coalition conducting strikes against the Islamic State, though Turkey has cooperated with the United States in other ways, including an agreement signed on Friday to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels on Turkish soil.Turkey has lobbied intensively for international military action in Syria, including no-fly zones and a presence on the ground to strengthen the more moderate Syrian rebel groups who are fighting both the extremists and the Syrian government. Turkey is also concerned about containing the flow of refugees from Syria, more than three million of whom have already been sheltered in Turkey.The Syrian government issued a statement on Sunday calling the military operation a ""flagrant aggression"" because Turkey did not wait for permission from Damascus to mount it. The Syrian government said the mission's success showed that the Islamic extremists were Turkey's ""puppets.""The armored rescue column entered Syrian territory through Kobani, the border town that was recently cleared of extremists by Kurdish forces after a long siege. The Kurds were aided by airstrikes and other support from the American-led coalition.Mr. Ulgen, the analyst, said the choice of route was a sign of some improvement in relations between the Turkish government in Ankara and the Syrian Kurds, whom the Turks have regarded with deep suspicion.Turkey has opposed Western military assistance to the Syrian Kurdish fighters, arguing that they were an extension of outlawed separatist groups like the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K., that are fighting for autonomy in Turkey's predominantly Kurdish southeast.""The coordination prior to Saturday's military operation displays some agreement with the Syrian Kurdish groups,"" Mr. Ulgen said. ""This cooperation, however, should not be regarded as a game-changer in Ankara's approach.""",1.0
Drone Strike in Yemen Said to Kill Senior Qaeda Figure:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- A senior member of Al Qaeda who had issued a statement saying the group had encouraged the terrorist attacks in Paris last month was killed in a drone strike on Saturday, the militant group said on Thursday.Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said that the drone strike, on Jan. 31, destroyed a car in Shabwah Province, in southern Yemen, killing four of its members who were inside. One of them, the statement said, was Harith al-Nadhari, an ideologue who had publicly praised the attack on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The group attributed the drone strike to the United States military.The announcement was made by a Qaeda member who acts as a media liaison for the militant group.""These strikes came after the Houthis, who became America's loyal partner in the south of the Arabian Peninsula, took full control under an American supervision and an international conspiracy,"" the statement said, referring to the Yemeni rebel group that has taken control of the capital.Houthi fighters forced the resignation of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi on Jan. 22 and have been negotiating with other political groups to form a new government. The Houthis, though bitter enemies of Al Qaeda, have publicly opposed American drone strikes in Yemen. But they have apparently done nothing to interfere with the strikes since they took de facto control last month, and the American military has said the strikes will continue.The Qaeda statement on Thursday said the drone strike that killed Mr. Nadhari, whom it described as a member of the group's Shariah Committee, was the fifth since the Houthis took over.The earlier Qaeda statement about the Paris attacks quoted Mr. Nadhari as suggesting that they were meant as revenge against ""some filthy French people"" for insulting the Prophet Muhammad.""Some sons of France misbehaved toward God's prophets, so some of the believer soldiers of God rose up against them and taught them good behavior and the limits of freedom of expression,"" Mr. Nadhari said. ""Those who came for you are soldiers who love God and his messenger, do not fear death, and lust for martyrdom in the path of God.""While he did not name the attackers or say that Al Qaeda had planned the attack, Mr. Nadhari praised their actions and said that France would face further attacks if it did not halt its ""aggression against the Muslims.""""O French, until when will you fight God and his messenger?"" he said. ""If you become Muslims, it is a good thing for you.""",1.0
Jordanians Step Up Bombing Raids on ISIS:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Jordan sharply increased airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria on Thursday in retaliation for the immolation of one of its pilots, as the United States sent additional Black Hawk helicopters to Erbil in northern Iraq to increase the number of aircraft and personnel on call to rescue downed pilots.Jordanian officials said dozens of warplanes carried out strikes against militant targets in Syria, hitting ammunition depots and training camps. That number is a dramatic increase over the two to four missions that Jordan had launched at one time in the past against militant targets. American officials said the Jordanians had conducted 15 to 24 strikes.Jordanian military officials said the stepped-up attacks represented only a first wave. A rare public announcement by the Jordanian military opened dramatically, saying: ""This is just a beginning. You will know who the Jordanians are!""Even as Jordan was stamping its imprint on the American-led campaign against the Islamic State, which has seized territory in both Syria and Iraq, the Pentagon said it was taking additional steps to reduce the time it would take to reach pilots who are shot down.The United Arab Emirates, another member of the coalition fighting the Islamic State, has demanded that the United States put in place a more effective search-and-rescue system in northern Iraq, closer to the battleground, instead of basing aircraft for such missions much farther south in Kuwait.The Emirates suspended combat missions in late December, citing fear for the safety of its pilots after the Jordanian pilot was captured -- and later burned to death by militants -- when his F-16 went down in northern Syria. American military officials said that Islamic State fighters captured the Jordanian pilot, First Lt. Moaz al-Kasasbeh, within minutes after his plane went down, and that search teams did not have enough time to locate him before he was captured.A senior military official said that Lieutenant Kasasbeh's parachute had been spotted quickly by the militants and that he had landed right in their midst.But his capture raised questions about whether rescue teams would have been able to get to Lieutenant Kasasbeh within the so-called golden hour, after which chances of survival from a crash or injury drop sharply. When United Arab Emirates officials discovered that most of the rescue teams and aircraft were based in Kuwait, they said that their pilots would not fly until there was a system in place for more rapid search and rescue.Two days ago, the United States Central Command notified Emirates officials that they had sent additional rescue helicopters and crew members to Erbil, Defense Department officials said. Officials declined to disclose the number of additional Black Hawk helicopters, and it was unclear whether they would be enough to restart Emirati combat missions.The rescue teams and aircraft -- or their lack -- would apply as well to the recovery of any downed American pilots flying missions over Iraq and Syria.A senior administration official said American officials had been trying to navigate around resistance from the Iraqi government, which has objected to Erbil as the location of American helicopters and V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, which take off and land like helicopters but fly like planes. The Iraqi government has expressed concerns that placing sophisticated American weaponry in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, could embolden the Kurds' ambitions for independence from Iraq.Even after the Emirates suspended combat missions, the Central Command continued to issue news releases saying otherwise. As recently as Wednesday, the military task force in Iraq that reports to Central Command put out a news release about airstrikes in Syria and Iraq on Jan. 27 and 28. ""Coalition nations conducting airstrikes in Syria include the U.S., Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates,"" the release said.A Central Command spokesman, asked about the discrepancy, said that ""unless there's a formal declaration, we leave it as it is.""Pentagon officials said that the additional American search-and-rescue aircraft and personnel in northern Iraq would be put to use on behalf of all pilots in the coalition fighting the Islamic State.Jordan has been taking part in the air campaign for months, but until now had kept its participation relatively quiet, for fear of animating Islamist extremists at home.The killing of Lieutenant Kasasbeh changed that. The day after the Islamic State released a video of its fighters burning the Jordanian pilot to death, the official Facebook page of the Royal Hashemite Court posted a photo of King Abdullah II of Jordan in military fatigues, flight harness and black gloves. On Thursday, the king was filmed paying condolences to the father of the slain pilot as warplanes flew overhead. The jets were said to be saluting the pilot's family on the way back from the mission against the Islamic State.In Washington, both Democratic and Republican members of Congress called for the United States to move quickly to steer military aid to Jordan, and Obama administration officials indicated on Thursday that additional assistance may soon be coming. Several administration officials said they welcomed Jordan's stepped-up effort against the Islamic State.""These are very capable pilots,"" said Air Force Col. Edward Thomas, spokesman for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey. ""We're reaping the benefits of two decades of training together.""A video posted online Thursday by the Jordanian armed forces showed pilots who took part in the airstrikes writing messages in chalk on their planes' bombs. One wrote, ""Islam has nothing to do with ISIS."" Another quoted the Quran as saying the militants would burn in hell.",1.0
U.S. General Says Hospital Strike Was 'Avoidable':   [Foreign Desk ],,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- The top American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John F. Campbell, said Wednesday that several service members had been suspended from duty after an internal military investigation of the American airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz last month.Calling the airstrike a ""tragic mistake,"" General Campbell read a statement announcing the findings of the investigation, which he said concluded that ""avoidable human error"" was to blame, compounded by technical, mechanical and procedural failures. He said another contributing factor was that the Special Forces members in Kunduz had been fighting continuously for days and were fatigued.The strike, which involved repeated attacks by a Special Operations AC-130 gunship early on Oct. 3, killed 30 people, mostly patients and Doctors Without Borders staff members, and gutted the main hospital building. The aid group said the attack continued for more than an hour despite repeated calls to the military by staff members, and despite the hospital's coordinates having been repeatedly sent to the American command.General Campbell and his staff did not say how many people were being disciplined, or how. But a senior United States military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said one of those punished was the Army Special Forces commander on the ground in Kunduz during the fighting. The official would not identify the commander by name but said the officer, a captain, was relieved of his command in Afghanistan on Wednesday morning.Kunduz, a provincial capital in northern Afghanistan, had been seized by the Taliban in the days before the airstrike. General Campbell said the gunship's crew believed it was firing on a different building identified as a Taliban base in the city. He said that the aircraft's targeting systems had failed to deliver accurate information and that email and other electronic systems aboard the aircraft, including a video feed that would normally have sent pictures to higher-level commanders in real time, had also failed during the operation.American officials said that the Special Operations troops did not follow the rules of engagement and that the airstrike should not have taken place. After reading the statement, General Campbell left the briefing room, at his headquarters in Kabul, without taking questions.Following up, the spokesman for the American command, Brig. Gen. Wilson Shoffner, sought to deflect a reporter's suggestion that responsibility might rest higher up the chain of command. He said the actions of the aircrew and the Special Operations forces ""were not appropriate to the threat that they faced."" And he repeatedly said the service members involved had not followed correct procedures for airstrikes or choosing targets.Asked if the military's investigators had questioned General Campbell in the course of their inquiry, General Shoffner declined to comment. General Campbell was ultimately in charge during the attack on the hospital, but a military official in Kabul said he was in an aircraft at the time, on his way to testify before Congress on Afghanistan.""I won't comment on General Campbell's position, as he is reviewing some of the recommendations that have been made in his capacity as the appointing officer of the investigation,"" General Shoffner said.Many of General Campbell's comments raised more questions than they answered.The general confirmed that Médecins Sans Frontières, the French name of Doctors Without Borders, had succeeded in reaching the Special Forces commander to inform him of the attack about 12 minutes into the airstrike, at 2:20 a.m. But he said the strike was not called off until 2:37 a.m. -- after the aircrew had already stopped firing. But that timeline does not agree with accounts by the aid group and other witnesses, who said the strike went on for more than an hour.The aid group, which has called for an independent, nonmilitary international inquiry into the airstrike, was sharply critical of General Campbell's remarks. ""The U.S. version of events presented today leaves M.S.F. with more questions than answers,"" said Christopher Stokes, the organization's general director. ""The frightening catalog of errors outlined today illustrates gross negligence on the part of U.S. forces and violations of the rules of war.""Human Rights Watch reiterated its call for a criminal investigation. ""The Kunduz strike still warrants a criminal investigation into possible war crimes, but the Pentagon did not clarify whether recommendations made to senior commanders include possible criminal investigations,"" said John Sifton, the Asia policy director for Human Rights Watch. ""We are deeply concerned that any decision making about any possible criminal charges, if they are made, remains within the chain of command responsible for military operations in Afghanistan.""In his account of the investigation report, which is said to be 3,000 pages long but has not been publicly released, General Campbell said that the targeting system on the AC-130 gunship that carried out the airstrike pointed to what proved to be an empty field. Realizing that was not correct, the crew on the gunship decided to target the Doctors Without Borders hospital as the building nearest to the coordinates that matched the description of the intended target.""The investigation found that the actions of the aircrew and the Special Operations commander were not appropriate to the threats that they faced,"" General Shoffner said. ""We did not intentionally strike the hospital, and we're absolutely heartbroken over what happened.""Mr. Stokes expressed outrage at that account. ""It appears that 30 people were killed and hundreds of thousands of people are denied lifesaving care in Kunduz simply because the M.S.F. hospital was the closest large building to an open field and 'roughly matched' a description of an intended target,"" he said.General Shoffner said that General Campbell had directed that American soldiers receive additional training on targeting, planning and rules of engagement.Neither the commanding general nor his spokesman made any comment on the repeated assertions of senior Afghan officials that the hospital was being used as a base by the Taliban to attack coalition forces.""This was a tragic but avoidable accident caused primarily by human error,"" General Campbell said. ""The medical facility was misidentified as a target by U.S. personnel who believed they were striking a different building several hundred meters away where there were reports of combatants.""",1.0
Jet's Navigator Says Turkish Forces Gave No Warning:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- The Russian navigator who parachuted out of a warplane shot down by Turkey said Wednesday that there had been no warning before a missile slammed into the aircraft, giving him and the pilot no time to dodge the missile.The navigator, Capt. Konstantin V. Murakhtin, was rescued by special forces troops who followed his radio beacon and negotiated his release from the insurgents who were holding him.""There were no warnings from either the radio channel or visually, there was no contact at all,"" he told the Interfax news agency from the Russian air base outside Latakia, Syria. The pilot, Lt. Col. Oleg A. Peshkov, was killed by ground fire from insurgents as his parachute descended.Captain Murakhtin's account directly contradicted that of Turkish officials, who said the pilots had been warned 10 times in five minutes not to transgress into Turkish airspace, even the sliver of territory that the plane crossed in 17 seconds. The Russians have been adamant that the warplane was shot down over Syria, not Turkey. It crashed about two and a half miles from the border, Russia said, and the pilots parachuted into Syria.Captain Murakhtin said he and Colonel Peshkov had stuck to their combat flight plan and were flying their bomber in ""normal mode"" when the attack occurred.Given the speed at which they were traveling, he said, the F-16 should have flown a parallel course as a standard visual warning. ""There was not even a threat of crossing into Turkey,"" Captain Murakhtin said.Captain Murakhtin's account was sure to further inflame sentiment in Russia. Its defense minister announced on Wednesday that it would deploy its most powerful air defense system in Syria. Protesters gathered outside the Turkish Embassy in Moscow, pelting it with eggs and rocks, shattering windows.In Washington, a senior United States military official who was briefed on the radar tracking of the Russian warplane said Wednesday that the data showed that the aircraft transited Turkish airspace, as Turkey has insisted.""They crossed into Turkish airspace,"" the official said of the pilots, speaking on the condition of anonymity as the official was not authorized to discuss confidential military reports.Such data was not likely to deflate the pronounced anger and outrage on the Russian side. The country's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said Russia had ""no intention"" of going to war against Turkey but reinforced the sharp criticism of Turkey as a haven for terrorists that Russia started soon after the plane was shot down.Mr. Lavrov repeated that he thought the shooting down of the military jet was a premeditated strike and hinted that the United States had a hand in it. ""We have enough information to confirm that this was a preplanned act,"" Mr. Lavrov said at a news conference. Turkey was just looking for a ""pretext"" to shoot down the plane, he said.Mr. Lavrov suggested that the United States might have had a role in the attack, wondering if Washington had signed off on Turkey's firing an American-made missile. In addition, the accord that the United States negotiated with Russia on preventing accidental air force clashes over Syria was meant to cover allies like Turkey, he said, and he accused Ankara of not activating emergency communications.It was clear that NATO members were critical of Turkey behind closed doors, Mr. Lavrov said, yet there was no remorse.In Washington, the State Department said that Secretary of State John Kerry had spoken with Mr. Lavrov by telephone, urging calm and more dialogue between Russia and Turkey.The American advice appeared to have been ignored, as sources on the ground said Russian airplanes had attacked a border town that Turkey has suggested is the heart of a buffer zone.Syrian opposition activists said that Russian planes had hit the town of Azaz, in what appeared to be a retaliatory strike, for the first time since the beginning of Russia's military intervention nearly two months ago.Azaz, an important gateway to Turkey about three miles from the border, is in an area that the Turkish government envisions as a ""safe zone"" within Syria where refugees could eventually return. Beyond its location, it is not believed to have any militarily significant targets, and the Syrian government has not bombed it for months.On Wednesday evening, several warplanes believed to be Russian bombed a gathering point for private commercial trucks in Azaz, killing at least three drivers and destroying four trucks, according to Abdulkader Abu Yusuf, a local activist who spoke by telephone.Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said the downing of the plane on Tuesday would not deter Russia from its military objectives in Syria.In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he wanted to avoid any escalation with Russia, but he stuck to his position that Turkey was defending its own security.""We have no intention of escalating this incident,"" Mr. Erdogan said in Istanbul. ""We are only defending our own security and the rights of our brothers.""The Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, maintained that the plane had been brought down because it had not responded to warnings, even if it flew over Turkey for 17 seconds, and that Turkey was not aware that it was a Russian warplane when its air force fired.He called Russia an ""important partner"" but also called for an end to Russian attacks along the border in an area that is home to the Turkmen, an ethnic group close to the Turks.The shooting down of the plane was sure to aggravate attempts to forge a united global effort to confront the Islamic State and negotiate a political transition in Syria. Turkey opposes President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and the Kremlin intervened militarily there to shore up his rule, hitting insurgents backed by Ankara.In Moscow, Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu announced that Russia would send its most modern air defense system, the S-400 mobile antiaircraft missile system, to the Hmeimim air base outside Latakia where its more than 50 warplanes and other aircraft are deployed.The system, known in the West as the SA-21 Growler, is designed to hit targets at long range, including aircraft and missiles.Colonel Peshkov and Captain Murakhtin fell on mountainous territory of northern Latakia Province, which is controlled by a local militia called the 10th Brigade. Footage on YouTube showed insurgents on the ground opening fire at the floating figures and exulting over what appeared to be the body of one of them.Five Mi-8 helicopters bearing search-and-rescue teams consisting of Russian special forces troops and their Syrian interpreters were dispatched to find the pilots, following a radio signal that one was emitting, according to Russian news reports.The Russian special forces found Captain Murakhtin in the hands of local insurgents around noon on Tuesday and spent hours negotiating for his release, the reports said. He was taken back to the Russian base around 3:40 a.m. on Wednesday, Mr. Shoigu said. The whereabouts of the body of the dead pilot has not been confirmed.Mr. Putin said on national television that the pilot, Colonel Peshkov, would be posthumously awarded Russia's highest military honor, the Hero of Russia.Aleksander M. Pozynich, a Russian marine in Syria on contract who was killed when a search and rescue helicopter was blown up, will also be given a medal, as will the rescued navigator, Captain Murakhtin, Mr. Putin said.Asked by Interfax how he felt after his plane was shot down, Captain Murakhtin said he was eager to get back into combat.

Jet's Downing Is Culmination of Old Friction:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey and Russia promised on Wednesday not to go to war over the downing of a Russian military jet, leaving Turkey's still-nervous NATO allies and just about everyone else wondering why the country decided to risk such a serious confrontation.The reply from the Turkish government so far has been consistent: Don't say we didn't warn you.Though minor airspace violations are fairly common and usually tolerated, Turkey had repeatedly called in Russia's ambassador to complain about aircraft intrusions and about bombing raids in Syria near the border. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday evening -- and a Pentagon spokesman later confirmed -- that before a Turkish F-16 shot down the Russian Su-24 jet, Turkish forces had warned the Russian plane 10 times in five minutes to steer away.""I personally was expecting something like this, because in the past months there have been so many incidents like that,"" Ismail Demir, Turkey's undersecretary of national defense, said in an interview. ""Our engagement rules were very clear, and any sovereign nation has a right to defend its airspace.""While that may be true, analysts said Mr. Erdogan had several more nuanced reasons to allow Turkish pilots to open fire. These include his frustration with Russia over a range of issues even beyond Syria, the Gordian knot of figuring out what to do with Syria itself and Turkey's strong ethnic ties to the Turkmen villages Russia has been bombing lately in the area of the crash.Turkey has been quietly seething ever since Russia began military operations against Syrian rebels two months ago, wrecking Ankara's policy of ousting the government of President Bashar al-Assad. The Turks were forced to downgrade their ambitions from the ouster of Mr. Assad to simply maintaining a seat at the negotiating table when the time comes, said Soner Cagaptay, a Turkish analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a nonpartisan research group.""That would require Turkey-backed rebels to be present in Syria, and I think Turkey was alarmed that Russia's bombing of positions held by Turkey-backed rebels in northern Syria was hurting their positions and therefore Turkey's future stakes in Syria,"" Mr. Cagaptay said. ""So this is also an aggressive Turkey posture in the Syrian civil war to prevent the defeat of Turkey-backed rebels so they can hold onto territory and have a say in the future of Syria.""But the fate of the particular rebels the Russians were bombing in the mountainous Bayirbucak area where the plane was shot down is more than just a policy matter to the Turks. Mr. Erdogan particularly emphasized the ethnic tie in a speech Tuesday evening, saying, ""We strongly condemn attacks focusing on areas inhabited by Bayirbucak Turkmen -- we have our relatives, our kin there.""The Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said as much on Wednesday while dismissing Russia's explanation that it was fighting a common enemy, the Islamic State. ""No one,"" he said, ""can legitimize attacks on Turkmens in Syria using the pretext of fighting the Islamic State.""The bombing was creating political problems for Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Cagaptay said. ""In the days leading up to the incident, many newspapers, especially the pro-government publications, were running headlines highlighting the suffering of the Turkmens, who are closely related to Anatolian Turks,"" he said. ""I think the government felt that, in terms of domestic politics, it had to do something to ease some of this pressure that had resulted from the Russian bombardment against Turkmens in northern Syria.""Russia's bombing of Turkmen villages was to be the principal issue Turkey raised with Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, in talks that had been set for Wednesday but were canceled after the shooting down of the plane.Mr. Erdogan's emphasis on helping the Turkmens has another important political dimension in Turkey. Mr. Erdogan's political party emphasized Turkish ethnic identity and Sunni Muslim faith in the campaign leading up to critical elections on Nov. 1, as it competed with one rival party heavily composed of Turkey's Kurdish minority and another committed to preserving Turkey's status as a secular society and state.Mr. Erdogan managed an important victory in that election, preserving his chances of winning legislative approval to change the Constitution and turn the country's parliamentary system into a presidential one.Complicating matters further, Turkey and Syria have a longstanding border dispute in exactly the area where the Russian plane, a Sukhoi Su-24, was shot down, and Russia has sometimes voiced support for Syria's claim. It is a narrow strip of territory, the Hatay Province of Turkey, that runs south along the Mediterranean Sea, deep into Syria.The province is a melting pot of ethnic Turks and Arabs. It is also a religious mélange, with many Muslims but also a large Christian population, as Hatay includes the biblical city of Antioch. And the province has an acrimonious history.The League of Nations granted Hatay Province to France after World War I as part of France's legal mandate over Syria. Ethnic Turks led the province's secession from Syria and declaration of an independent republic in 1938, and that republic then joined Turkey the next year -- much as Texas seceded from Mexico a century earlier, became a republic and soon joined the United States.Syria has periodically questioned the loss of Hatay over the years. ""If you look at Syrian maps, that province, that chunk of territory, is shown as belonging to Syria,"" said Altay Atli, an international relations specialist at Bogazici University.When Hatay seceded from the French mandate of Syria, Hatay's borders did not encompass all of the ethnic Turks in the area; many Turkmens remained just across the border in what is now northernmost Syria. For decades, it was difficult for families divided on either side of the border by the secession of Hatay to even visit one another. Tensions finally began to ease during the years immediately before the Arab Spring, but they have resumed in the last several years as Turkey has led calls for the removal of Mr. Assad.The fact that Russia has over the years expressed sympathy for Syria's claim to Hatay makes the province even more delicate for Turkey, and Tuesday's incident with the Russian jet even more important, said James F. Jeffrey, a former American ambassador to Turkey who is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.He questioned whether the Russian jet had strayed into Hatay Province's airspace accidentally or whether Russia might have been deliberately allowing incursions by its jets during military activities in Syria because of Hatay's tangled history.""Turkey was tired of Russia's intimidating Turkey,"" he said.The Russian and Ottoman Empires battled for centuries for control over the area from the Balkans to the Black Sea, and vestiges of that bloody rivalry keep arising. One of those is reflected in Turkey's deep concern about Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, said Murat Yesiltas, the director of security studies at the Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research, a large research group in Ankara with close government links.Turkey now faces across the Black Sea a much wider arc of territory occupied by Russian forces. Many in Turkey are further upset by Russia's treatment of the Crimean Tatars, who speak a Turkic language and have opposed the Russian annexation. Most of the Crimean Tatars' leaders have been forced into exile by Russia, and this week Tatars have been blocking repair crews from restringing crucial power lines to Crimea that were mysteriously blown up over the weekend, producing a nearly total blackout on the peninsula.""Turkey wants to protect the territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" Mr. Yesiltas said. Turkey has already provided economic assistance to Ukraine, but it has been reluctant to confront Moscow more publicly because Russia is one of Turkey's biggest export markets and supplies three-fifths of Turkey's natural gas.With President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia saying things about the jet's downing like, ""We will never tolerate such crimes like the one committed today"" and warning of ""serious consequences,"" the biggest question perhaps is what comes next.Russia on Wednesday announced plans to deploy its most modern air-defense system, the S-400 mobile antiaircraft missile, to its air base outside Latakia. But while most experts -- and Mr. Erdogan himself, in remarks on Wednesday -- play down concerns of a wider confrontation, many worry that the biggest losers from Tuesday's incident could be the Turkmens.While the jet's two crew members were able to eject from the plane, Russia said that one of them was killed -- possibly by fire from the ground as he floated to earth -- as was a marine sent in a helicopter that was shot down by local ground forces while trying to rescue the pilots; the Kremlin said the second crew member had been rescued by Russian special forces.Several experts warned that Mr. Putin may step up his country's attacks on the Turkmens in retaliation.""They're the real target,"" Mr. Jeffrey said. ""He can just plaster them.""Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter. Sign up here.",1.0
A Top Militant Is Reported Killed in Pakistan:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- An American drone strike on Wednesday killed a senior commander of the Pakistani Taliban in Afghanistan, near the border with the North Waziristan region of Pakistan, according to Pakistani intelligence officials in the tribal belt.The commander, Khan Sayed, also known as Sajna, led a breakaway faction of the Pakistani Taliban.The drone strike occurred in the Damma region in Khost Province, near Shahadianu Patala, a Pakistani town in North Waziristan, the Pakistani intelligence officials said. They said the strike had killed 12 other militants and wounded 20.Another Pakistani intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, also reported that the commander had been killed in the strike.The Pakistani officials' claims have not yet been independently confirmed, partly because of the remoteness of the site and the restrictions on journalists' access to the area. There was also no immediate comment from American officials, who do not typically comment publicly on drone strikes.According to local elders, Taliban commanders were meeting to resolve the growing differences among the various Taliban offshoots when the drone strike took place.""Sajna was a leading figure of the Pakistan Taliban,"" said a senior Peshawar-based Pakistani military official who agreed to discuss the commander, a founding member of Tehrik-e-Taliban, the umbrella organization known as the Pakistani Taliban that was formed in 2007 and has been carrying out a bloody insurgency in Pakistan. ""Both Pakistani security forces and Americans were after him for long time,"" the military official added.If the commander's death is confirmed, ""it would certainly be a big blow to the Taliban, both in Pakistan and Afghanistan,"" said another Pakistani Taliban commander who gave an interview by phone on the condition that his name not be used.In 2014, Sajna publicly rejected the Pakistani Taliban's leader, Maulana Fazlullah, and said his faction would continue to fight on its own. The feud erupted after an American drone strike killed Mr. Fazlullah's predecessor, Hakimullah Mehsud. Sajna said in a statement that he was leaving because ""the present leadership has lost its path.""The number of American drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal area has sharply declined in recent months. The Pakistani military has also recently developed its own drone, which is being used for both aerial surveillance and missile attacks.",1.0
U.S. Strikes Try to Cut Taliban Momentum:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- In a clear sign of concern over the Taliban's momentum in northeast Afghanistan, the American military conducted two airstrikes on the group's positions in a remote corner of the country on Friday afternoon as Taliban fighters, driving captured Rangers and Humvees, quickly took over a pair of district centers.Ordinarily, a Taliban offensive in isolated Badakhshan Province might cause few reverberations in the capital, Kabul, and would most likely not set off an American military response.But this week, the Taliban captured Kunduz, a city of 300,000 people, in its largest victory in more than a decade.Clearly emboldened, the Taliban have carried out smaller-scale offensives in a number of provinces across the north, including in Badakhshan, a sparsely populated expanse of rival warlords and isolated villages. Since Thursday, a force has captured two district centers in quick succession, provoking widespread concern in the provincial capital, Faizabad, that the Taliban were headed their way.Beyond that, residents and officials in Baharak, the latest district center to fall, said that more than 1,000 members of the Afghan security forces who gathered on Friday morning had retreated as the Taliban attacked and seized the area. At 5:45 p.m., the American military conducted airstrikes on both the district of Baharak and its neighboring district, an American military spokeswoman said.Residents of Baharak interviewed by phone said that the Taliban's shadow governor in Badakhshan had been killed in one of the strikes, but that could not be confirmed and such reports often turn out to be wrong.In two other northern provinces, Takhar and Baghlan, the insurgents also made substantial gains in recent days. Those losses raise the question of whether the Afghan security forces, already struggling to respond to the Taliban's capture of Kunduz at the beginning of the week, would be able to contain emboldened insurgent forces across northeast Afghanistan.As recently as last week, the Taliban and the security forces appeared to be in a stalemate at the conclusion of a bloody fighting season that had led to a heavy death toll for Afghan soldiers and police officers.But the Taliban broke the stalemate early Monday with the capture of Kunduz. Most of the city's defenders quickly retreated or disappeared in a defeat that the Afghan government has since struggled to explain.In a sign of declining confidence in the government, several powerful political leaders and military commanders, some veterans of the fight against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, met in Kabul on Friday to discuss how to respond to Kunduz's fall and the Taliban's advances across the northeast.The extent of Taliban gains became more apparent in the days after the fall of Kunduz, as government reinforcements struggled to break through Taliban ambushes along crucial roads, sapping the Afghan military's ability to mount a large-scale counterattack.By Wednesday night, Afghan security forces had fought their way into Kunduz, but by Friday the Taliban still held parts of the city, including its central square, residents said. The fighting persisted in a number of neighborhoods, with reports of close-quarters fighting. Taliban fighters were said to be attacking Afghan troops in Humvees with rocket-propelled grenades and a machine gun mounted on a motorcycle. By Friday, residents reached by telephone reported a series of airstrikes bombarding the city.An American military spokeswoman confirmed that there were three American airstrikes on the city's outskirts over the course of the day.Doctors Without Borders, which runs the main trauma hospital in the city, said it had treated 345 people, including 59 children, since Monday morning.The number of dead remained unknown. Residents reported seeing bodies in the streets. At the Doctors Without Borders hospital, at least 37 people had died of their wounds by the time they were brought there.The hospital was running short of supplies, including blood, because the road to Kunduz from Kabul had been blocked by insurgents at at least two points. Trucks carrying medical supplies left Kabul on Tuesday, but by Friday they still had not been able to reach Kunduz.The International Committee of the Red Cross said that emergency medical supplies were ready to be flown in from Kabul as soon as security at the Kunduz airport improved.In eastern Afghanistan, shortly after midnight on Friday, an Air Force C-130J transport plane crashed, although the American military said it did not appear to be the result of Taliban fire. The dead included six crew members, who were American armed forces personnel; five civilian contractors working for the American-led military mission in Afghanistan; and three Afghans who were on the ground.""With high confidence, it does not appear at this time that enemy fire was involved in the aircraft crash,"" said Maj. Tony M. Wickman, an Air Force spokesman in Afghanistan.The cause of the crash was under investigation. It occurred as the four-propeller transport aircraft, assigned to the 774th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron, was taking off from the American base in Jalalabad.The fighting in Kunduz has led to an exodus of residents, not only from that city, but also from neighboring provinces, including Takhar and Baghlan. There, the Taliban have taken territory over the past week.By Friday afternoon, a state of anxiety had settled over many residents in the picturesque capital of northeastern Badakhshan, nestled in a valley.""I am afraid of Taliban and their brutality,"" one resident said as he described his plan to fly out of Faizabad with his family on the next plane. ""I am a moderate Afghan whose daughter and two boys are studying in schools.""He worried that even if local Taliban fighters left him alone, the influx of foreign fighters over the past year or two might kill him and marry off his daughter. He worried that other residents of the city might inform on him to any invading Taliban.""In fact, I am even afraid of my neighbors who know that I am a teacher who supports democracy,"" he said.",1.0
Foreign Ground Troops Join Yemen Fight:   [Foreign Desk ],,"AL-MUKALLA, Yemen -- The United Arab Emirates has sent a military brigade to aid fighters battling Houthi rebels in Yemen, senior Yemeni and United States military officials said Monday, in a move that threatened to escalate a regional struggle between Iran and the monarchies of the Persian Gulf.The Emirati troops landed in the southern port city of Aden in recent days, bringing with them tanks and other armored vehicles, the officials said. They quickly had an effect, participating in a rout of Houthi fighters on Monday from one of Yemen's largest and most strategically important air bases, according to a senior Yemeni military commander.A coalition of Sunni Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia and including the United Arab Emirates, has been waging a bombing campaign against the Houthis since late March -- largely driven by the view that the Houthis, a Shiite-led movement from northern Yemen, is fighting on behalf of Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival.The Houthis acknowledge their alliance with Iran but deny that they are acting as its proxy. The Obama administration has said that the Saudis are exaggerating the ties between Tehran and the Houthi rebels, who control Sana, the capital, and other parts of Yemen. The criticism has not deterred the Saudis from carrying out thousands of airstrikes and imposing an air and maritime blockade around Yemen as part of an aggressive offensive that aid workers say has helped fuel a humanitarian crisis.Apparently frustrated with an impasse in the combat -- as well as growing international condemnation of airstrikes that have killed hundreds of civilians -- the Saudi-led coalition recently increased its assistance to fighters battling the Houthis in Aden. Fighters recaptured the city from the Houthis last month. Some of the Yemeni fighters were trained in the Persian Gulf, and the United Arab Emirates supplied them with armored vehicles.Small numbers of Saudi and Emirati troops have been fighting in Yemen for at least the last few weeks, according to southern Yemeni commanders. The arrival of the Emirati brigade, though, marked the first time a large foreign force had entered the ground war. ""The U.A.E. and the Saudis are putting a lot into this,"" said a senior United States military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational reports. He said the two countries' aggressive military intervention said a great deal about their concerns over Iran's expanding influence.The Houthis and their allies still control large portions of the country and remain deeply entrenched in the north. But they have faced intensifying pressure over the last few weeks as they have lost territory and as the Saudi coalition has committed more military resources.In the south, the Houthis are struggling against a force that includes southern separatists, the fighters who trained in the Persian Gulf and now the troops from the United Arab Emirates.After weeks of trying, the anti-Houthi fighters said they had captured the Al-Anad air base on Monday after attacking it from several approaches.Al-Anad, which is about 30 miles north of Aden and sits at a major road junction, is seen as a critical access point to Yemen's southern and western provinces.The capture of the air base, which could not be confirmed independently, would be the second major defeat for the Houthis in less than a month. In another sign of the Houthis' growing isolation, Yemen's national airline told airport officials in Sana on Monday that it was stopping commercial flights to Sana indefinitely, said Khalid Al-Shayef, the director of Sana's airport.",1.0
Turkey Brings Down Russia Warplane on Syrian Mission:   [Foreign Desk ],,"MOSCOW -- Two big powers supporting different factions in the Syrian civil war clashed with each other on Tuesday when Turkish fighter jets shot down a Russian warplane that Turkey said had strayed into its airspace.The tensions immediately took on Cold War overtones when Russia rejected Turkey's claim and Ankara responded by asking for an emergency NATO meeting, eliciting more Russian anger and ridicule. After the meeting, the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, called for ""calm and de-escalation"" and said the allies ""stand in solidarity with Turkey.""It was thought to be the first time a NATO country has shot down a Russian plane in half a century. And while few expect a military escalation, with neither Russia nor NATO wanting to go to war, the incident highlighted the dangers of Russian and NATO combat aircraft operating in the same theater and has soured chances for a diplomatic breakthrough over Syria.As President François Hollande of France met with President Obama in Washington to urge a closer and more aggressive alliance with Russia against the Islamic State, Turkey's decision to fire on a Russian warplane attacking targets in Syria has raised tensions between Moscow and NATO and undercut efforts to persuade Russia to drop its support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.Turkey wants Mr. Assad gone, and has allowed its border with Syria to be an easy crossing point for Syrian rebels, including those the West regards as terrorists or radical Islamists; Russia wants to prop up Mr. Assad and his government. While Moscow says it is attacking the Islamic State, for the most part Russian planes and troops have been attacking the Syrian rebels, some of whom are supported by the United States and the West, who most threaten Mr. Assad's rule.Mr. Obama said again Tuesday that Russian air attacks on moderate opponents of Mr. Assad had only helped him and that they should be directed at the Islamic State.Mr. Hollande and Mr. Obama clearly hoped that the bombing of a Russian passenger jet over Egypt, claimed by the Islamic State, would cause Moscow to make defeating the jihadists more of a priority than propping up Mr. Assad. But Tuesday's events will make that a tougher sell, for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia wants to be seen as an equal player in the conflict, not beholden to Western policies.Turkey, especially under the increasingly authoritarian rule of its nationalist president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been fierce in defending its airspace, shooting down Syrian jets that have strayed in the past. Turkey insisted that it issued 10 warnings over a five-minute period to the Russian pilot of the Sukhoi Su-24 to pull away.But Mr. Putin, clearly angry, responded that the Russian jet had never violated Turkish airspace and was shot down over Syria. Speaking in Sochi, he called the downing of the plane a ""stab in the back delivered by the accomplices of terrorists,"" warning that it would have ""serious consequences for Russian-Turkish relations.""Mr. Putin said that instead of ""immediately making the necessary contact with us, the Turkish side turned to their partners in NATO for talks on this incident. It's as if we shot down the Turkish plane and not they, ours. Do they want to put NATO at the service of the Islamic State?""A United States military spokesman, Col. Steven Warren, confirmed on Tuesday that Turkish pilots had warned the Russian pilot 10 times, but that the Russian jet ignored the warnings. Colonel Warren, speaking from Baghdad to reporters in Washington, also said American officials were analyzing radar track data to determine the precise location of the jet when it was shot down.At the emergency NATO meeting, Turkish officials played recordings of the warnings Turkish F-16 pilots had issued to the Russian aircraft. The Russian pilots did not reply. The Turkish account of the episode was described by several diplomats, who asked not to be identified because they were discussing a closed-door session at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels.After Turkish representatives presented their side of the encounter at the meeting, they received expressions of support for their country's territorial integrity, according to the diplomats' account.The Russian Su-24 that was struck was over the Hatay region of Turkey for about 17 seconds, according to one diplomat who attended the NATO meeting. But the plane re-entered Syrian airspace after being hit and therefore crashed in Syria, the diplomat said.Tensions between Russia and Turkey had increased lately over Russian bombing of Turkmen tribesmen in northern Syria, whom Turkey regards as under its protection and who are fighting to oust Mr. Assad. Just this week, Turkey summoned the Russian ambassador in Ankara to demand that Moscow stop targeting Turkmen tribesmen in Syria.""It was stressed that the Russian side's actions were not a fight against terror, but they bombed civilian Turkmen villages, and this could lead to serious consequences,"" the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.And so it has. The diplomatic spat may have led directly to Moscow continuing to target the Turkmens on Tuesday, and Turkey's aggressive response.What may make matters worse is that those same tribesmen say they shot and killed both Russian pilots as they floated to earth in their parachutes, having apparently ejected safely after the plane was hit by air-to-air missiles. The tribesmen then reportedly destroyed a Russian helicopter with a TOW antitank missile as it tried to rescue the airmen.The Russian Ministry of Defense said late Tuesday that one fighter pilot had been killed by ground fire and that a marine deployed on the search-and-rescue helicopter died but that the rest of the crew had escaped.NATO countries have been concerned about Mr. Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian tendencies for some time, and NATO officials acknowledge that Turkey's agenda in Syria does not always match that of Washington, Britain or France -- let alone Russia.And while he has recently allowed American planes to use Incirlik air base for sorties into Syria, Mr. Erdogan's own troops have largely turned their fire on the Syrian Kurds, whom Washington regards as its best local ally so far against the Islamic State.Turkey has been in a struggle for decades with Kurdish separatists in Turkey, labeling them terrorists, and regards the Kurds in Syria and Iraq as sharing the same desire to break away and form a Kurdish state.In a speech on Tuesday, Mr. Erdogan said there would have been more incidents like Tuesday's if Turkey had not exercised such restraint.""The reason why worse incidents have not taken place in the past regarding Syria is the coolheadedness of Turkey,"" he said in speech in Ankara. ""Nobody should doubt that we made our best efforts to avoid this latest incident. But everyone should respect the right of Turkey to defend its borders.""While Mr. Hollande is pressing Mr. Obama for tougher action against the Islamic State and plans to travel to Moscow on Thursday to meet Mr. Putin, Washington-Moscow tensions, high over Russia's annexation of Crimea, were highlighted again on Tuesday when Mr. Obama complained that Russian airstrikes against moderate opposition groups in Syria were bolstering the Assad government instead of trying to destroy the Islamic State.But the United States and Russia have different interests in Syria, and Mr. Putin has been clear about the need to preserve the existing Syrian government, if not Mr. Assad himself as leader. Mr. Obama, like Mr. Hollande, is committed to the ouster of Mr. Assad and believes that the Syrian strongman is complicit with the Islamic State -- from which his government buys considerable amounts of oil -- as a means of dividing his own opposition.In a news conference in Washington with Mr. Hollande, Mr. Obama said, ""I do think that this points to an ongoing problem with the Russian operations in the sense that they are operating very close to the Turkish border and they are going after moderate opposition that are supported by not only Turkey but a wide range of countries.""Turkey has the right to defend its territory, Mr. Obama said, but he urged both sides to talk to make sure they figure out what happened and ""discourage any kind of escalation.""Russia's retaliation so far has been largely symbolic. Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov canceled a Wednesday visit to Turkey, and a large Russian tour operator, Natalie Tours, announced it was suspending sales to Turkey. Russians accounted for 12 percent of all tourists to Turkey last year.The two countries are also significant trade partners. But ""Russia-Turkey relations will drop below zero,"" Ivan Konovalov, director of the Center for Strategic Trends Studies, said on the state-run Rossiya 24 cable news channel.Washington is not interested in getting deeper into Syria with ground troops or having a conflict with Russia. So cautious are the NATO countries about Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, which calls for mutual self-defense, that when Mr. Hollande declared ""war"" on the Islamic State after the Paris attacks, he invoked the European Union's toothless Lisbon Treaty and sidestepped NATO. Mr. Hollande was also, French officials have said, eager not to offend Mr. Putin by making Syria a NATO issue.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

Report Cites Human Error in Airstrike on Hospital:   [Foreign Desk ],,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- The American airstrike that destroyed a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz last month was the result of human errors, failures in procedure and technical malfunctions, according to military officials briefed on the internal investigation.""It's a combination of factors,"" said a senior Defense Department official, describing the findings in a 3,000-page investigative file examining the Oct. 3 airstrike that killed at least 30 people, mostly doctors and patients. The military is expected to give details on the findings at a news conference on Wednesday.Two other military officials briefed on the investigation said the Special Operations AC-130 gunship used was intended to target a different compound several hundred feet away that was thought to be a Taliban base of operations in the city.The military officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the report before its official release, said the investigation found that the gunship's crew had been unable to rely on instruments to find the target. Instead, they relied on descriptions of the location relayed by troops on the ground, a mix of American and Afghan Special Forces. Based on those descriptions, the crew locked onto the hospital compound, mistakenly believing that it was the building the ground troops were describing, the two officials said.It remained unclear if relying on such informal instructions would amount to a breach of military operational rules in an urban area with civilians present. And the officials' account did not address why the ground forces said to be in contact with the gunship would not have informed the crew that it was hitting the wrong building at some point during the hour-plus that the aircraft kept up its heavy fire.Doctors Without Borders has maintained that the American airstrike -- a continuing series of attack passes that gutted the hospital's clearly marked main building -- constituted a war crime.The group had reminded the United States military several times about the hospital's exact coordinates, and officials with the group made a series of frantic calls to the American command and other offices to try to halt the attack. Witnesses said the plane also appeared to track and fire at people as they tried to flee.""A mistake is quite hard to understand and believe at this stage,"" Christopher Stokes, the general director of Doctors Without Borders, said at a news conference in Kabul this month.The military's initial accounts were later found to be incorrect, and Gen. John F. Campbell, the top American commander in Afghanistan, has called the airstrike a mistake without explaining how the hospital came to be targeted. President Obama later apologized for the attack.According to the military officials, the building the gunship had meant to target was the headquarters of the Afghan intelligence service, the National Directorate of Security, in Kunduz. The city had fallen to the Taliban a few days earlier, and the officials said the insurgents had taken over the compound.Shortly after 2 a.m. on Oct. 3, the gunship opened fire on the main hospital compound, making the first of five passes over the building. By the fifth, more than an hour later, about 30 people were dead, mostly patients and the doctors and staff members who were treating them. The hospital, the largest in northern Afghanistan, was in flames.One official said investigators believed that the gunship crew did not receive a full preflight briefing, which could have contained information about the hospital's being a protected site under the Geneva Conventions.In addition, the United States troops did not follow their own rules in calling in the airstrike when no American and Afghan troops were in extreme danger, said another of the officials briefed on the inquiry.The American Special Operations Forces also apparently did not have ""eyes on"" -- or were unable to positively identify -- the area to be attacked to confirm it was a legitimate target, the officials said.",1.0
Jordan and Emirates Carry Out Airstrikes in Syria Against Islamic State:   [Foreign Desk ],,"WASHINGTON -- Fighter jets deployed by Arab allies launched a series of airstrikes in Syria in the early hours Tuesday, as the United Arab Emirates returned to combat missions against the Islamic State for the first time since December, and Jordan separately continued its escalation of strikes against Sunni militants.A squadron of Emirati F-16 fighters struck Islamic State targets in Syria and returned safely to base in Jordan, the U.A.E. Armed Forces announced.Emirati officials said the concerns that had prompted them to suspend combat missions -- that the United States Central Command had not deployed sufficient assets closer to the battlefield to rescue downed pilots -- had now been addressed.Jordan also stepped up its raids; Mansour Jaboor, the head of Jordan's Air Force, said that Jordan had carried out 56 airstrikes against the Islamic State in recent days, as King Abdullah of Jordan continued to make good on his promise to avenge the immolation of a Jordanian pilot by the militant Sunni group.Bahrain's ruler issued a public statement that his country was ready to assist Jordan in the fight against the Islamic State, according to a statement released by Jordan's palace.Jordanian officials denied reports of a large movement of ground troops toward the Iraqi border, and asked journalists to ""be careful and to abide by the information that is issued by the concerned agencies and the Jordan Armed Forces.""""There is no talk about a ground war,"" one official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity in accordance with government protocol. ""We will not be reluctant to face this criminal gang in any place in the world to defend our religion, our nation, and the future of our country and our sons.But in other ways, since last week, when the video of the pilot being burned alive was released, King Abdullah has been stepping up raids on the Islamic State -- or at least increasingly publicizing them -- and working to increase Arab participation in the coalition against the group.The public announcements of increased Arab participation in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, is welcome news for the Obama administration, which has sought to characterize the fight against the Sunni militants as an international coalition with Arab participation.While American pilots have by far carried out the bulk of the combat missions in Iraq and Syria, the United States is loath to appear as if it is acting alone. So the suspension of Emirati combat missions in December came as a blow.American military officials maintained that Islamic State fighters captured the Jordanian pilot, First Lt. Moaz al-Kasasbeh, within minutes after his plane went down, and said that search teams did not have enough time to locate him before he was captured. A senior military official said that Lieutenant Kasasbeh's parachute had been spotted quickly by the militants and that he had landed right in their midst.But his capture raised questions about whether rescue teams would have been able to get to him within the so-called golden hour, after which time chances of survival from a crash or injury drop sharply. When United Arab Emirates officials discovered that most of the rescue teams and aircraft were based in Kuwait, they said that their pilots would not fly until there was a system in place for more rapid search and rescue.Last week, the United States Central Command notified United Arab Emirates officials that they had sent additional rescue helicopters to Erbil, Iraq.In an interview on Tuesday, Yousef al-Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States, said that Emirati concerns had been addressed.""The suspension of combat operations was made for purely operational and planning reasons, not political ones,"" Mr. Otaiba said. He added that the Emirates was ""fully committed"" to defeating the Islamic State ""and will not back down.""But far more than the oil-rich Gulf Arab states, Jordan is dealing with poverty and unemployment, said Hasan Abu Hanieh, a Jordanian expert on Islamist groups. The Obama administration has increased aid to Jordan, and Congress is prodding the White House to increase military assistance as well.Jordan, however, ""needs to make sure the public feels they have a real say in this,"" Mr. Hanieh said. Other analysts said that the most significant contribution that Jordan could make could be through its intelligence contacts, strengthened by clan and tribal links to Iraqis across the border.President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, in a rare interview with the BBC on Monday, denied the widely documented use of indiscriminate barrel bombs by Syrian government forces against civilian areas.""I know about the army,"" Mr. Assad said. ""They use bullets, missiles and bombs. I haven't heard of the army using barrels, or maybe cooking pots.""Mr. Assad also maintained that Damascus was being informed about airstrikes against the Islamic State, and said that they could help his government if they were ""more serious.""But the Pentagon press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said the United States was not ""communicating or coordinating our military operations with the Assad regime.""",1.0
North Korea Tests Five Missiles:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea fired five short-range missiles off its eastern coast on Sunday in a demonstration of its improving missile technology, the South Korean Defense Ministry said.The five projectiles were launched from locations near Wonsan, a coastal town east of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and flew about 125 miles northeast before plunging into the sea, a Defense Ministry spokesman here said on the customary condition of anonymity.The missile launchings came a day after North Korea said that its leader, Kim Jong-un, had witnessed the test-firing of a new antiship missile.Under Mr. Kim, the North has conducted missile and rocket tests more often than in the past. It is developing an intercontinental ballistic missile and trying to make a nuclear warhead small and sophisticated enough to fit onto the missile, according to United States and South Korean officials.Some of the North's frequent tests of short-range missiles in recent years have indicated that the country is developing missiles capable of more efficiently targeting United States and South Korean military bases south of the inter-Korean border, South Korean officials have said.Last month, North Korea offered to impose a moratorium on nuclear tests if the United States and South Korea suspended their annual large-scale joint military drills. Washington quickly rejected the proposal, and the two countries plan to start the joint war games in March.North Korea has called the drills a rehearsal for invasion and has often responded with its own military exercises and missile tests. In recent weeks, Mr. Kim has overseen field exercises by his military and vowed that he felt no need to negotiate with the United States, according to North Korean media.",1.0
British Planes Intercept Russian Bombers:   [Foreign Desk ],,"LONDON -- The Royal Air Force scrambled warplanes to intercept two Russian bombers off the coast of Cornwall in southwest England, the Defense Ministry said Thursday, as a government minister sounded alarms about the Kremlin's intentions elsewhere in Europe.The episode magnified concerns about the possibility of further moves by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that could draw in the NATO alliance after advances by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.Typhoon warplanes took off from an air base in eastern England and escorted the two Russian airplanes in international airspace ""until they were out of the U.K. area of interest,"" the Defense Ministry said in a statement. The encounter happened on Wednesday.""At no time did the Russian military aircraft cross into U.K. sovereign airspace,"" the statement said. During the Cold War, Russian bombers routinely tested Western defenses by flying toward the coast, and there have been reports that the practice has been resumed as tensions have mounted over the conflict in Ukraine.The number of intercepts of Russian military aircraft approaching Western airspace has tripled compared with 2013, British researchers said in November, citing NATO officials.""I suspect what's happening here is that the Russians are trying to make some sort of a point,"" Prime Minister David Cameron said during a visit to eastern England, ""and I don't think we should dignify it with too much of a response.""The Russian flights came as Britain's defense minister, Michael Fallon, said Mr. Putin could replicate the tactics used in Ukraine on the Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, former Soviet bloc countries that are now members of NATO.""NATO has to be ready for any kind of aggression from Russia, whatever form it takes,"" Mr. Fallon said, adding that he was worried about Mr. Putin's exerting ""pressure on the Baltics, the way he is testing NATO.""""You have tanks and armor rolling across the Ukrainian border, and you have an Estonian border guard being captured and not yet still returned,"" Mr. Fallon told reporters from The Times of London and The Daily Telegraph traveling with him to Sierra Leone. He was referring to an episode in September, when Russian operatives crossed into Estonia, grabbed an Estonian internal security officer at gunpoint and dragged him into Russia, Estonia has said.Mr. Fallon also recalled an intercept of Russian aircraft two weeks ago over the English Channel between Britain and France.""We had to scramble jets very quickly to see them off,"" Mr. Fallon continued. ""It's the first time since the height of the Cold War.""Mr. Fallon described Mr. Putin's strategy as ""a very real and present danger.""Mr. Fallon was also said to have asserted that Mr. Putin ""is as great a threat to Europe as the Islamic State,"" a reference to militants fighting to establish a caliphate in Iraq and Syria.In Moscow, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said Russia would seek a way to respond to Mr. Fallon's ""absolutely unacceptable"" remarks, which had gone beyond ""diplomatic ethics,"" Reuters reported.After the earlier flights over the English Channel, the British government summoned the Russian ambassador to demand an explanation.Russian military planes flying near British airspace caused ""disruption to civil aviation,"" the British Foreign Office said at the time, calling the maneuvers ""part of an increasing pattern of out-of-area operations"" by Russia.Dismissing Britain's concerns, the Russian ambassador said the patrols were routine.",1.0
Egypt Launches Strike in Libya on ISIS Branch:   [Foreign Desk ],,"CAIRO -- Egypt conducted an airstrike against an Islamist stronghold in Libya on Monday in retaliation for the beheading of at least a dozen Egyptian Christians by a local franchise of the Islamic State, in Cairo's deepest reach yet into the chaos that has engulfed its neighbor.Hinting at possible further action, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt said in a statement that he had convened ""a continuous session"" of his National Defense Council to monitor events in Libya and to weigh additional measures. But the strike itself, hitting in the Libyan town of Derna at dawn, was a new turn in the breakdown of regional order in the aftermath of the Arab Spring revolts and the Islamic State's emergence.Nearly three and a half years after the ouster of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, two rival coalitions of militias are battling for control over Libya and its vast resources, including nearly $100 billion in financial reserves, untapped oil deposits, and a long Mediterranean coast facing Europe. In the absence of any effective government or even a dominant force, a multifaceted proxy war has erupted as rival Arab states back competing militias and extremist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State seek to expand their operations.Mr. Sisi, a former general who led the ouster of Egypt's Islamist president in 2013, has watched with growing concern as a coalition of moderate Islamists, extremists and regional militias seized control of the Libyan capital, Tripoli, last year and set up their own provisional government.Together with the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Sisi has covertly backed a rival coalition that has coalesced around a Libyan general's campaign to drive out the Islamist and regional militias. Last summer, Egypt provided bases for jets from the United Arab Emirates to launch at least two airstrikes against Islamist forces in Tripoli, Western officials have said, although neither country has publicly acknowledged its role.Egypt's strikes on Monday now threaten to drag it deeper into Libya's messy internal conflict at a time when Cairo is already straining to revive a battered economy and suppress its own domestic Islamist insurgency -- centered in the Sinai Peninsula but now also fighting under the banner of the Islamic State.In this new theater, Egypt is highly vulnerable to potential counterattacks by Islamist forces, in part because of its long and porous desert border with Libya, but also because of the continued presence of large numbers of Egyptian citizens inside Libya. Egyptian workers often seek jobs in oil-rich Libya, and a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said Monday that ""hundreds of thousands"" remained inside the country.For its part, the Islamic State may consider Egypt's entry into the Libyan battle a strategic success, analysts said, in part because the extremists seek to capitalize on the spreading chaos.""They want to stretch the Egyptian military because they are fighting in the Sinai, too,"" said Aaron Y. Zelin, a researcher at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who tracks the group. He argued that the extremists would rally local support against Egypt's military interference -- especially if its airstrikes hit civilians -- but also that the Islamic State had built its ideology on cultivating such enemies.""They see it as proof that God is on their side, that even as all these forces are arrayed against us, we are 'remaining and expanding,' as their saying goes,"" he said. ""This is red meat for their base of supporters.""A similar dynamic unfolded this month when Jordan carried out days of bombing raids against the Islamic State in Syria in retaliation for its videotaped burning to death of a captured Jordanian pilot.Egyptian militants, including the self-proclaimed Sinai Province of the Islamic State, have killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen in the 18 months since Mr. Sisi took power. They killed as many as three dozen Egyptians in one night of coordinated bombings at the end of January.But the events that led to Egypt's bombing on Monday began several weeks ago with the disappearance of about 20 Egyptian Christians working in the mid-coastal Libyan city of Surt.Fighters identifying themselves as the Tripolitania Province of the Islamic State -- adopting the name of one of the three traditional provinces based on Ottoman-era divisions -- released a photograph last month showing that they had captured the Egyptian ""crusaders.""Then on Sunday night, the media arm of the central Islamic State group released a video headlined ""A Message Signed With Blood to the Nation of the Cross,"" which appeared to show at least a dozen of those hostages being paraded along a rocky Mediterranean beach in western Libya.All wore orange jumpsuits and were escorted by a row of masked fighters dressed in black with ceremonial knives at their chests -- details identical to previous Islamic State videos. After a short speech delivered in fluent English by the lead executioner, the fighters forced their captives to the ground, sawed through their necks and let their blood darken the waves.In a televised address later Sunday night, Mr. Sisi declared that ""Egypt preserves the right to respond, in the appropriate manner and timing, to exact retribution.""In state news media reports issued Monday around 8:30 a.m., the Egyptian military said its F-16 fighters had struck camps, training facilities and weapons depots belonging to the Islamic State in Libya. A statement from the military called the attack ""a response to the criminal acts of terrorist elements and organizations inside and outside the country.""""We stress that revenge for the blood of Egyptians, and retribution from the killers and criminals, is a right we must dutifully enforce,"" the military said, and Egyptian state television showed footage of the F-16s taking off in the dark as the statement was read on the air.The military statement did not disclose the location of the strikes. But a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Badr Abdelatty, later confirmed news reports that the jets had hit Derna, Libya, where some of the local Islamist fighters have declared themselves the Barqa Province of the Islamic State.Although far from Tripolitania Province, where the Islamic State group that killed the Egyptian Christians is from, Derna is close enough to the border for Egypt's jets to reach it easily without having to refuel en route. Western officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, noted that none of the three Islamic State ""provinces"" were open or visible enough to easily target, suggesting that even a prolonged campaign of airstrikes might do little harm to the groups.But the strikes drew applause from Libya's internationally recognized government, which relocated from the capital around the time it was taken over by an Islamist-allied militia and now sits near the Egyptian border in a town under the protection of Gen. Khalifa Hifter, who is leading the fight against the Islamists.""Egypt has helped us as we requested,"" Col. Saqer al-Joroshi, a commander under General Hifter, said by telephone in an interview with an Egyptian television network. Mr. Joroshi estimated that the strikes had killed ""not less than 40 or 50"" people.The Islamist-allied coalition, which calls itself Libya Dawn and has established a provisional government in Tripoli, sought to deny that the Islamic State executions had taken place, reinforcing criticisms that the coalition willingly collaborates with such violent extremists.In a statement, the Libya Dawn government dismissed the execution video as ""a Hollywood film"" contrived by its opponents. It called Mr. Sisi a ""terrorist criminal and murderer"" and charged that the Egyptian airstrikes in Derna had killed civilians. (Mr. Joroshi said no civilians had been killed; his assertion could not be verified.)In what was apparently a threat, the same statement also warned all Egyptians to leave Libya within 48 hours ""to preserve their safety from any revenge attacks.""Mr. Abdelatty, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Egypt had established an emergency consular services center to help Egyptians caught inside Libya get to safe havens or return to Egypt.The United States and its allies have tried to draw the Libyan factions into negotiations to form a unity government and dissuade them from demanding the complete military defeat of their opponents before any such talks.Western officials have previously argued that military escalations such as Egypt's bombing on Monday pose obstacles to a negotiated, political solution, but some have also acknowledged Egypt's right to respond to an attack on its civilians. A State Department representative declined to comment.In a statement, Mr. Sisi said he had sent Egypt's foreign minister to New York and Washington ""to ensure that the international community lives up to its responsibilities,"" because Libya had now become ""a threat to international peace and security.""",1.0
High-Tech Air Battle Against ISIS Is Slowed by Low-Tech Ground Fight:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ABOARD U.S.S. THEODORE ROOSEVELT, in the Persian Gulf -- Navy fighter jets roar off this nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in support of Iraqi troops approaching Ramadi, a city in Anbar Province overrun by Islamic State fighters in one of the worst defeats for the American-led coalition.The six-hour round-trip flights provide air cover for Iraqi troops on the ground as Navy and Marine fighter pilots and weapons officers drop bombs on Islamic State fighting positions. The American airmen destroy large trucks, weapons caches and the fighters themselves. No target is too small: They even strike individual heavy machine guns.And yet, 10 weeks into the campaign to retake Ramadi, it remains in the control of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Since the fall of the city in May, Iraqi forces have cut off some resupply routes into its center and have advanced to some outlying suburbs.Last week, in large part because of American airstrikes, Iraqi troops dismantled an Islamic State command base. They have retaken the University of Anbar, although American officials are unsure if the entire campus is secure.But the urban heart of Ramadi is still a no-go zone, with dug-in Islamic State fighters continuing to control the city, rigging neighborhoods throughout with explosives.From the flight deck of this carrier, the Theodore Roosevelt, it is the ultimate paradox: No matter how fast and expensive and advanced the American air campaign -- and it is all of those things -- warfare in Iraq remains a slow and grinding business.About 65 combat planes -- F/A-18 Hornets and F/A-18E Super Hornets armed with 500-pound laser-guided bombs, plus EA-18G Growlers for jamming enemy radar -- cost $57 million each. They launch one after another in a series of catapulted slingshots, soaring into the skies from the Persian Gulf, and head to Iraq on their missions. The F/A-18s can travel up to one and a half times the speed of sound.But they can go only as fast as their partners on the ground. In the new American way of warfare, those partners are not highly trained American troops, with more than a decade of combat experience in Iraq and Afghanistan under their belts, communicating directly on the telephone in English with the American pilots overhead.They are the Iraqi security forces, who tell their Iraqi commanders in Arabic where they need airstrikes. Those commanders then relay that information to command centers in Baghdad and Erbil, where American controllers then call the pilots in the air, in a convoluted game of telephone that can add crucial minutes to the overall enterprise.Nor do the Iraqi ground forces have the combat engineering equipment that their American counterparts have. Capt. Lanier Bishop, a 31-year-old Marine fighter pilot from Marietta, Ga., said last week after a few flights over Ramadi in his Hornet that ""not a single bridge around the city is left -- ISIL's blown them all up.""Normally, that would not pose much of a problem for American troops, who can lay their own bridges over the Euphrates River into the city. But the Iraqis do not have that kind of battlefield engineering equipment, and that has slowed them down as well.What's more, Captain Bishop said he had seen destroyed highway overpasses, apparently blown up by the Islamic State, that block access into the city, further slowing the pace of the advance. And the militants have laid booby traps and bombs along routes into the city, American pilots said.From the cockpit of his F/A-18 fighter jet a few days ago, Capt. Benjamin Hewlett of the Navy, commander of the carrier's air wing, said he had watched a convoy of Iraqi forces move inch by excruciating inch across a road outside Ramadi. ""Every time you have an asymmetric threat like ISIS, they booby-trap everything, and that slows down the progress,"" he said in an interview aboard the Roosevelt.But, he added, ""the opposite of slow and deliberate is fast and sloppy, and then not always the right people die.""""The Iraqis are not interested in destroying Anbar University, and they are putting themselves at a lot of risk so that they don't do so,"" he said.Vice Adm. John W. Miller, commander of the Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, voiced some optimism. ""Eventually, I think we'll be successful, but we're only able to go as fast as the Iraqi security forces can go,"" he said.On the enormous flight deck of the Roosevelt -- the Navy likes to describe its carriers as five acres of sovereign territory -- things look anything but slow. More than 5,000 bustling sailors in helmets, goggles, safety vests and color-coded shirts (the better to figure out who is doing what) move quickly between loud fighter jets.The sailors in the red shirts are the ones who handle the bombs. The ones in blue shirts handle the aircraft elevators, while the ones in the white shirts are safety workers. The ones in purple handle fuel, the ones in green handle the catapults that sling the planes into the air, and the ones in yellow direct the pilots to take off and land.On deck it is 113 degrees, and with the humidity the heat index regularly reaches 150 degrees.As a fighter jet gets ready to take off, the scene becomes almost like ballet. The ""shooters,"" the sailors in the yellow shirts, move in synchronized formation to direct the pilots, since no one can hear amid all the noise. For each flight, two shooters use their entire bodies to signal the pilots.They hold their hands above their heads with two fingers up, then make fists, then wave again, then make fists again, then hold their arms straight out to the side, in the direction the plane is supposed to go.That is just the start. After that the sailors do a karate chop, wag their fingers, point and then squat to touch their index fingers on the deck to indicate everything is clear for takeoff. And then, finally, they point straight ahead from the squatting position, and the catapults release the screaming planes into the air.For the airmen, it is then on to Iraq -- not only to Ramadi, but also to Baiji, where Iraqi forces and Islamic State militants have been battling for months, and to Sinjar, where the persecution of Yazidis first prompted American airstrikes a year ago, and where Islamic State militants still battle for territory.It is not always dramatic work.Last Thursday, Lt. Michael Smallwood, 28, from Hilliard, Ohio, and Lt. John Izzo, 27, from North Babylon, N.Y., took off in their F/A-18 fighters in the scorching sun a little after 4 p.m. The heat index had just begun climbing down from 140 degrees. After refueling in the skies over southern Iraq, the two jets headed first toward Kisik Junction, a city west of Mosul, where Kurdish forces have battled Islamic State militants. The command came to Lieutenant Smallwood to scan the area for militants. He saw none, and 15 minutes later both he and Lieutenant Izzo needed to refuel. They left Kisik Junction for the refueling, but then got an order to move to Baiji, north of Ramadi. There they scanned again for militants but saw nothing before it was time to return to the Roosevelt for what the Navy calls an ""arrested landing"" -- the tailhook of the plane catches a wire and goes from 150 miles an hour to zero in about two seconds.A frustrating day? Lieutenant Izzo shrugged. ""Sometimes it's frustrating,"" he said. ""But it's never boring.""Photograph The Nuclear-Powered Aircraft Carrier Theodore Roosevelt in the Persian Gulf, Where It Coordinates Airstrikes On Isis Positions Involving 65 Combat Planes.; Sailors Aboard the Carrier Prepared Jets for Six-Hour Round-Trip Missions to Provide Air Cover for Iraqi Troops On the Ground, During Which Navy and Marine Fighter Pilots and Weapons Officers Bomb Islamic State Positions.

South Korea Accuses North After Mines Maim 2 in the Demilitarized Zone:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean soldiers sneaked across the heavily guarded border with South Korea and planted land mines near one of the South's military guard posts, and two southern soldiers were maimed after stepping on them, the South Korean Defense Ministry said Monday.The two South Koreans, both staff sergeants, triggered the mines on Aug. 4 just outside their post, within the South Korean half of the 2.5-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone, a buffer separating the two Korean armies.One soldier lost both legs in the first blast, involving two mines. The other soldier lost one leg in a second explosion as he tried to help his wounded colleague to safety, the ministry said.""This is a clear provocation by the North Korean military,"" said Kim Min-seok, a spokesman for the South Korean military. ""We swear a severe retaliation.""Investigations showed that the mines were planted by North Korean soldiers to target troops from the South, Maj. Gen. Koo Hong-mo said at a news briefing. They were typical land mines from the North that used wooden boxes, he said.The mines were found just outside the South Korean guard post, which is 1,440 feet south of the military demarcation line, the official border that bisects the DMZ. They exploded as the soldiers opened the gate of a barbed-wire fence to begin a routine morning patrol, said Brig. Gen. Ahn Young-ho, a military investigator.The explosions last week were the first of their kind in 48 years, South Korean officials said.During and after the Korean War, both Koreas planted hundreds of thousands of mines in and near each side of the DMZ to thwart infiltrators.Hundreds of South Korean villagers near the border have been injured or killed after stepping on or picking up stray mines.The blasts last week took place near Paju, a front-line town north of Seoul. They were especially shocking because South Korean officials said that infiltrators from the North had come within striking distance of a South Korean guard post and had retreated, undetected, after planting three mines on both sides of a barbed-wire fence protecting the post.General Koo said that the North Koreans probably planted the mines between July 22, when South Korean guards last used the gate, and Aug. 4, when the soldiers were wounded.Officials here said that the last episodes in which South Korean troops had been killed or wounded by similarly planted North Korean mines inside the DMZ took place in 1967.""For the North, this is a low-cost provocation that creates a big psychological impact on the South,"" said Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University in Seoul. ""Those North Korean wooden box land mines usually blow away legs only, not always killing their victims.""Mr. Kim said that the episode was unlikely to lead to an armed skirmish on the tense border but that it would probably harden the South's stance on the North and hamper any short-term efforts to improve ties.The North has not responded to the South Korean accusation. If the mines were indeed planted by the North, it would be one of its most daring provocations since it shelled a South Korean island in 2010, killing four.The American-led United Nations Command, which oversees the Korean armistice and investigated the mine episode with the South, said it ""condemns these violations"" of the armistice and called for talks between generals from the command and the North.Both the command and the South Korean military ruled out the possibility that the mines were old ones that had drifted from their original placements because of rain or shifting soil.The DMZ was created in 1953 as part of the Korean War armistice. The armistice has never been replaced with a peace treaty, leaving the divided Korean Peninsula technically in a state of war.Both Koreas protect their sides of the DMZ with guard posts, barbed-wire fences and minefields. So many mines are there that wild deer sometimes step on them, causing blasts.Old mines loosened by floodwaters also pose a risk for soldiers serving in the zone. In 2010, dozens of North Korean land mines moved into the South through floodwaters, killing one villager and scaring vacationers away from rivers and beaches near the border.According to a 2011 survey, 116 villagers have been killed by mines in Gangwon, one of the two South Korean provinces on the border with the North.Despite the booby traps, armed commandos and spies from both sides often infiltrated the border in the years after the Korean War, though both governments have officially said that such infiltrations stopped since the 1970s.In recent years, South Korea has installed numerous closed-circuit and heat-detecting cameras along the border and around its guard posts.But its efforts to detect infiltrators were often hampered by lush summer forests inside the DMZ, officials said. (One of the two blasts last week was captured by such a camera, and its footage was released by the Defense Ministry.)The South Korean military's vigilance came under scrutiny in recent years, as several defectors from the North have crawled across the DMZ to South Korean guard posts.In 2012, sentries from the South did not know of an infiltration until a defecting North Korean soldier knocked on a window of their guard post.In June, another soldier from the North arrived at a guard post in South Korea and spent a night outside, undetected, before turning himself in the next morning.Later Monday, South Korea resumed loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts across the border for the first time in 11 years. Such broadcasts, including bitter criticism of the North's government, were suspended in 2004 as part of efforts at reconciliation.Conservative South Koreans have called for the resumption of the broadcasts as relations have deteriorated in recent years.The North, meanwhile, has threatened to attack the loudspeakers if the broadcasts resume.Photograph A South Korean Patrol Sunday Near the Site of Two Land Mine Explosions Last Week in the Demilitarized Zone.

Air Attacks Said to Kill 23 in Yemen:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SANA, Yemen -- Airstrikes by a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia hit a house south of the capital on Wednesday, killing at least 23 people who were attending a wedding party, said witnesses and a local medical worker.The attack was the second airstrike on a wedding in Yemen in a little over a week, and it added to growing criticism over the coalition's air campaign, which has killed more than 1,100 civilians over the past six months, according to the United Nations.On Sept. 28, coalition warplanes bombed wedding tents on the Yemen's Red Sea coast, killing at least 70 people.Saudi Arabia launched a military offensive in March against rebels known as the Houthis after they drove the Saudi-backed government from power. As war has spread throughout the country, more than 2,355 civilians have been killed -- the majority of them in coalition airstrikes, human rights workers say.The airstrikes on Wednesday were in Dhamar Province, about 50 miles south of Sana, the capital, on the house of Muhammed al-Sanabani, said a cousin, Tawfiq al-Sanabani, who was nearby.Three of Muhammed al-Sanabani's sons were to be married in a joint ceremony on Wednesday night, the cousin said. The airstrikes occurred just as the brides had arrived at the house. At least one of the sons was killed in the attack, Mr. Sanabani said.""I saw bodies lying in the yard, decapitated, charred,"" he said.Safwan al-Ansi, the chief of the emergency department at the Dhamar health office, said that 23 people had been killed but that more bodies were still under the rubble of the house. Mr. Sanabani said he did not know why the house had been targeted.",1.0
Russian Violations of Turkish Airspace Are Seen in West as a Test:   [Foreign Desk ],,"For what NATO's secretary general described as a ""long time"" and Russia's Defense Ministry characterized as just ""a few seconds,"" a Russian fighter jet violated Turkey's airspace on Saturday, increasing tensions and raising concerns about Russian aggression beyond mere saber rattling.NATO said that a Russian aircraft also violated Turkish airspace on Sunday. The response was swift from Western powers that were already anxious about Russian warplanes flying near their own aircraft in Syria and near their own sovereign airspace.Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, said that a pilot flew into Turkish airspace on Saturday by mistake, because ""of unfavorable weather conditions in that area,"" according to Tass, Russia's government-owned news agency.But Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, said ""it doesn't look like an accident,"" and there have been a number of other instances recently of Russian military flights entering the airspace of NATO members or coming very close, prompting interception by Western military aircraft.The presumed purpose of such incursions is to gauge the target country's reactions. Which radar systems and which missile batteries are activated and reveal themselves? Which planes are scrambled from which bases, and how quickly? How loudly and publicly do leaders complain, and how much backing do they get at home and from international allies?In February, as tensions mounted in Ukraine, the Royal Air Force scrambled warplanes to intercept Russian bombers flying off the coast of Cornwall in southwest England. The incident carried echoes of the Cold War, when Soviet aircraft would routinely test Western defenses in this way, and NATO would do the same to the Soviet bloc.The February encounter was the closest to occur near England in decades. British researchers noted at the time, citing NATO officials, that the number of Russian aircraft intercepted as they approached Western airspace had tripled from 2013.In 2014, Norway scrambled F-16 fighters to intercept Russian warplanes off its coast 74 times, a 27 percent increase from 2013. The Russians did not actually violate Norwegian airspace, but they have done so in the Baltic nations, which were once part of the Soviet Union.In October 2014, NATO reported an ""unusual"" spike in Russian military flights across Europe, according to The Associated Press. The alliance observed large-scale maneuvers in international airspace involving Tu-95 Bear H strategic bombers, MiG-31 fighters and other Russian warplanes.Norway, Britain, Portugal, Germany, Denmark and Turkey scrambled fighters in response; so did two non-NATO countries, Finland and Sweden, according to The A.P.Russia's involvement in Syria is the first time in a generation that it has conducted military operations outside the former borders of the Soviet Union. Though Russia maintains that its airstrikes target the Islamic State militant group, just as the American-led coalition's airstrikes do, Western officials say Russian forces have actually been attacking other rebel groups, including some that receive assistance from the United States.Though the Russians have so far mounted most of their airstrikes far from areas where the American-led coalition mainly operates, the skies over Syria are now crowded with military aircraft.The risk of accidents and unplanned confrontations has risen, prompting calls from Western countries for greater coordination between the United States and Russia.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

"At Parade, North Korea Flaunts New Missiles and China Ties:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"SEOUL, South Korea -- Long columns of goose-stepping soldiers, accompanied by what North Korea claimed were nuclear-tipped missiles, marched through central Pyongyang, the capital, on Saturday, as the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, gave his first public speech in three years to emphasize his ""love for the people"" and declare his readiness to ""fight any form of war"" with the United States.Mr. Kim celebrated the 70th anniversary of his ruling Workers' Party on Saturday with what appeared to be one of the largest military parades the North had ever organized. As warplanes flew overhead, the plaza in Pyongyang was filled with soldiers and citizens chanting slogans of loyalty to the Kim family and waving pink and red artificial flowers in synchronized moves.In a 25-minute speech before the parade, Mr. Kim spoke of his ""love"" and ""dedication to the people,"" whom he thanked for staying with his party through decades of American-led economic sanctions and blockades.In his first public speech, before a similar military parade in 2012, Mr. Kim promised that North Koreans would ""never have to tighten their belt again."" Pyongyang, the showpiece capital where the people most loyal to the regime are allowed to live, has since gone through a major face-lift. But economic conditions for people in the rest of North Korea remain dire, according to international human rights groups.Mr. Kim's efforts to reinvigorate the economy are hampered by United Nations sanctions, prompted by the North's nuclear and long-range missile programs. His government also spends lavishly to maintain the personality cult surrounding his family.On Saturday, Mr. Kim did not mention his nuclear or missile programs but vowed to continue his policy of pursuing a nuclear arsenal and economic development simultaneously.""Our revolutionary armed forces are ready to fight any form of war the American imperialists want,"" he said, while the only prominent foreign guest -- Liu Yunshan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Politburo -- stood nearby.Mr. Liu is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the North since Mr. Kim rose to power in late 2011. President Xi Jinping of China also sent a warm note to Mr. Kim, a sign that relations may be thawing after a deep chill.In the message, widely reported by the Chinese state media, Mr. Xi said he not only extended the congratulations of the Chinese Communist Party but sent his own personal good wishes. He hailed Mr. Kim for having achieved ""positive progress in developing the economy, improving livelihoods, and so on.""China is the isolated North's only major ally, and Mr. Xi had seemed to establish a new distance between the countries soon after taking power in late 2012. He said that no country should be allowed to destabilize the Asian region or the world for ""selfish gain,"" a statement that was interpreted as a criticism of Mr. Kim's nuclear weapons program.China has signed on to United Nations sanctions meant to punish North Korea for its nuclear weapons program, and Mr. Kim was absent from China's military parade in Beijing last month.Despite its concerns about the North's nuclear program, China has not used its full economic leverage to discourage the North from pursuing it, apparently being more concerned about potential instability in the North that could spill into its territory. China's economic largess keeps North Korea's bare-bones economy afloat, but a debate has been roiling in the past year among Chinese military officials and academics over whether its ally is more a liability than an asset. China has also been expanding its ties to South Korea.A Chinese expert on North Korea, Yang Xiyu, said the tone of Mr. Xi's letter to Mr. Kim was fairly standard.The wording is ""always the same no matter whether the bilateral relationship is in good shape or bad shape,"" said Mr. Yang, a senior fellow at the China Institute of International Studies.But John Delury, an associate professor of international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, said Mr. Xi seemed to have used the occasion to mend fences with the North, at least to a degree.""Xi's letter marks the Chinese leader's first real effort to make friends with Kim Jong-un,"" Mr. Delury said. ""The fulsome praise of the Kim dynasty is new for Xi, whose administration has sounded guarded, even irritated, in its language toward Pyongyang.""Mr. Delury noted that Mr. Xi's letter did not mention denuclearization, in contrast with an earlier message carried by Vice President Li Yuanchao, who in 2013 tried to press North Korea to slow down its nuclear program.Mr. Xi's failure to mention denuclearization will disappoint those in Washington who believed that Beijing was coming around to their hard-line stance toward Mr. Kim, Mr. Delury said.The North's state-run Korean Central Television showed columns of tanks, drones and rocket tubes. South Korean officials said that the tubes included a new model with a range long enough to strike South Korean and American military bases south of Seoul. The highlight was what South Korean officials said appeared to be a new version of KN-08 long-range missiles.The KN-08 is widely believed to have been designed as the North's first intercontinental ballistic missile. But it has never been flight-tested, so when it was first shown in public in 2012 and 2013, some outside analysts said it might be a mock-up of a system still under development.",1.0
"NATO, Tested by Russia in Syria, Raises Its Guard and Its Tone:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"BRUSSELS -- Confronted with its biggest military challenge since the end of the Cold War, a weakened NATO took steps Thursday to shore up its flanks, both in the Middle East and Europe, as Russia continued to test the credibility of the alliance's bedrock principle of collective defense.Western officials have been alarmed by the speed and scale of Moscow's intervention in Syria. Russia's warplanes have violated Turkish airspace -- deliberately so, NATO officials have said -- and its warships in the Caspian Sea have fired cruise missiles at targets in Syria -- though several seemed to have fallen short of their mark, landing somewhere in Iran, a senior American defense official said on Thursday.Not wanting to inflame the situation, but also wary of appearing too passive, Western officials have responded cautiously, taking a number of limited steps while raising the rhetorical heat on Moscow.On Thursday they said they had stepped up military exercises and deployed a small number of logistics personnel in Eastern and Central Europe. Britain announced that it would send soldiers to the Baltic countries, Poland and Ukraine after the show of force by Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin. Germany condemned Russia's operations in Syria in unusually pointed terms.""We are implementing the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the Cold War,"" NATO's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said before a meeting of defense ministers here on Thursday. After the meeting, he said, ""All of this sends a message to NATO citizens: NATO will defend you, NATO is on the ground, NATO is ready.""NATO has stationed Patriot batteries in Turkey to protect it from missiles emanating from Syria, but those had been scheduled to be removed this year. NATO officials have been discussing whether to keep the batteries in Turkey, given Russia's actions, but Mr. Stoltenberg played down that possibility.British officials said that units of up to 150 personnel would be regularly deployed to the Baltic countries, Poland and Ukraine to support military training. The Defense Ministry said it was sending 25 more British personnel to provide ""infantry, medical and survival skills"" to Ukrainian troops. The additional British personnel raises the number there to 100 from 75.Michael Fallon, the British defense secretary, called the decision part of a ""policy of persistent presence and aid for our allies on the eastern flank of NATO in response to Russian aggression and provocation.""The NATO moves announced Thursday were mostly symbolic, although Russia quickly reacted to the British announcement. Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for Mr. Putin, told journalists that any increased presence of British troops in Eastern Europe would be regrettable, according to Agence France-Presse, adding that it would amount to Britain's using an alleged Russian threat as camouflage to press ahead with NATO expansion. Russia, he said, would respond with ""parity.""As Western defense ministers -- including the United States defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter -- met here on Thursday, much of the discussion focused on Russia and Syria, and in particular the timing of the launch of 26 cruise missiles across more than 900 miles, from the Caspian Sea, into Syria.""They did this the day before a meeting of NATO defense ministers,"" one NATO official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the negotiations. ""Obviously, that is a message, but who can say what Putin is thinking.""But even as the alliance sought to project its power toward the Russian border, and to remind Moscow that Russian maneuvers in Turkish airspace could invite a response, several NATO officials expressed frustration that they did not see a clear path out of the increasingly complicated tangle that has become NATO's relationship with Russia. One said that the expansion of NATO toward Russia's borders was the reason Mr. Putin was now maneuvering for elbow room, both in Eastern Europe and in trying to retain his access to the Mediterranean Sea through Syria.Mr. Putin insists that Russia's intervention in Syria and its support for a ground offensive there -- which appeared to be an effort involving Iran, the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and the pro-government army, which is loyal to Syria's embattled president, Bashar al-Assad -- is intended to target militants from the Islamic State. But Western officials say he is using that pretext to batter other insurgent groups that have been trying to overthrow Mr. Assad.""The Russians are not mainly targeting ISIS, but they are targeting other opposition groups and they are supporting the regime,"" Mr. Stoltenberg said. ""And I call on Russia to play a constructive and cooperative role in the fight against ISIS, not to continue to support the Assad regime. Because to support the regime is not a constructive contribution to a peaceful and lasting political solution in Syria.""Bloomberg News quoted the German defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, as saying, ""When Russia attacks those who are fighting the Islamic State, that strengthens the Islamic State.""NATO announced that it was stepping up military exercises and establishing two small military headquarters, in Hungary and Slovakia, supplementing six others -- in the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and in Bulgaria, Poland and Romania. Each headquarters has about 80 military personnel, about half from the host state and the rest from NATO, according to officials at the alliance in Brussels. These officials said the headquarters mainly served as hubs for planning for potential reinforcement by NATO forces and assessing logistics, like the depths of ports or the lengths of runways.The alliance has taken steps since the Russian incursion into Crimea and Ukraine to build up a rapid reaction force in the Baltic states. While not stationing large numbers of troops in the region, it has stockpiled equipment, including 1,200 armored vehicles and 250 Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles that could be quickly deployed, officials have said.Meeting separately in Luxembourg, European Union interior ministers on Thursday were seeking to address the region's migration crisis that has been prompted in part by the Syrian conflict.The ministers were discussing a common rule book for expelling migrants ineligible for asylum; ways to fortify the European Union's external borders; and a list of safe countries where migrants can be returned.The ministers' conclusions are likely to be discussed at a summit meeting of European Union leaders on Oct. 15 and 16, when the issue of migration will top the agenda.Arriving at the meeting in Luxembourg, Theresa May, the British home secretary, called for urgent measures to dissuade migrants unlikely to qualify for asylum from going on dangerous journeys to Europe.""We should be sending economic migrants back to their countries of origin,"" Ms. May told reporters. ""On returns, we need to see Europe upping its game.""Jean Asselborn, the foreign minister of Luxembourg who is leading the meeting, told reporters, ""The control of external borders, immigration generally and also returns -- it's a package.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Photograph Debris From What Activists in Syria Said Was an Attack by the Russian Air Force On Wednesday in the Countryside of Idlib Province.

"Off the Coast of Iran, a High-Stakes Version of Spy Versus Spy:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"MANAMA, Bahrain -- The commander of the Navy's Fifth Fleet was in his office on the afternoon of July 25 when he got the phone call: An Iranian Navy frigate in the Gulf of Aden had approached a ship where an American military helicopter had just landed.Crew members on the Iranian ship pointed a heavy machine gun at the American helicopter, an alarming provocation at a time when critics are trying to kill a nuclear deal limiting Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The American helicopter, following standing orders to defuse tensions instead of elevating them, took off from the ship, but the Iranian crew continued to track it with the gun for a few moments before turning away.Then the report took a strange turn. During the entire episode, Vice Adm. John W. Miller, the Fifth Fleet commander, was told that an Iranian film crew aboard the frigate was videotaping everything. ""The whole thing took a couple of minutes,"" Admiral Miller said later, recounting his surprise at the film crew. ""We have no idea why they were filming it.""But wait, how did the Navy know the Iranians were filming the episode?Admiral Miller burst out laughing. ""Well, because we were filming them,"" he said. ""We have our video of their video.""In the crystalline waters of the Arabian Sea, it is spy versus spy between the United States and Iran. Ever since the United States, Iran and other world powers signed a pact to rein in Tehran's nuclear ambitions, skeptics of the deal -- which is subject to congressional approval -- have feared that the United States and Iran, longstanding regional adversaries, might let up on decades of vigilance.But in the skies and waters of the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden, the two continue to constantly watch each other. American naval ships openly roam the waters along Iran's 1,100-mile-long southern coastline, their radar trained on the Iranian shore and on Iranian ships leaving their harbors. Iranian fighter jets patrol the skies, keeping an eye on American combat planes that take off from an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf every time an Iranian jet comes close to their ship.""It's a little bit of a game we play,"" said Capt. Benjamin Hewlett, the commander of the air wing aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, which is in the Persian Gulf keeping an eye on Iran right now. ""When they launch, we launch. We consider this our sovereign territory, so we make sure they're not unescorted in and around the aircraft carrier.""Sometimes it seems like a game of chicken -- only with risks so high that a single misstep could unravel what has been a tenuous standoff between the United States and Iran for 36 years.But for the Obama administration, the American naval presence off Iranian shores is now more important than ever as the administration seeks to assure Middle Eastern allies and a skeptical Congress that the United States will continue to keep an eye on Iran.Aboard the Theodore Roosevelt, a steady stream of military officials from the region have arrived to see the situation for themselves. A few weeks ago the Saudi defense minister, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, got a standard tour of the flight deck and viewings of fighter jets screaming into the air, but Navy officials also took him into the combat direction center, a classified room deep in the carrier where operations specialists track Iran using an array of high-tech equipment.Officers on the Roosevelt said there was less Iranian activity in the gulf in the weeks leading up to the conclusion of the nuclear deal in July, but all the officers said the slowdown was most likely because of Ramadan. After the deal was signed -- and Ramadan ended -- the officers said Iranian activity in the gulf picked up as Iran deployed more warships off the Iranian coast and increased its fighter jet flights.""I don't think things are any different now than they were before"" the nuclear pact was signed, Rear Adm. Roy Kelley, the commander of the strike group aboard the Theodore Roosevelt, said in an interview on the ship's bridge. ""We have interactions every day with Iran. Fifty percent of the Persian Gulf coastline is Iran, so when they see us here, they come and check us out.""He added that ""for the most part, they're professional.""A few minutes later, an announcement sounded throughout the aircraft carrier: ""Gun Quarters....Set Conditions Thunder"" -- something unknown was nearing the carrier, which, Captain Hewlett said, usually means an Iranian ship or aircraft.It was in fact an Iranian ship, but it did not get close, and soon there was the all clear.The constant watchfulness can make for heightened nerves. In April, just two days after the Roosevelt arrived in the Persian Gulf to relieve the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson, military officials ordered the ship to turn around and head to the waters off the coast of Yemen to block an Iranian convoy suspected of transporting weapons to Houthi fighters there. The Roosevelt, escorted by the guided missile cruiser Normandy, was soon passing through the Strait of Hormuz into the Arabian Sea and then south to the Arabian Peninsula.On board, sailors realized that the world was watching to see who would blink first. ""Us arriving and then turning around so soon was unusual,"" said Cmdr. Andrew Strickland, the head of the Combat Direction Center on the Roosevelt. In the combat center, where much of the time is spent watching Iran, suddenly tactical officers were watching themselves -- on television news reports about the drama unfolding as the Roosevelt moved to block the Iranian convoy. ""It was definitely weird to suddenly be seeing your own ship on CNN,"" said Lt. William Thomas, a tactical action officer who works in the combat center.For the Obama administration, it was important to signal to skeptics that even though the United States was in the final stages of negotiating the nuclear deal with Iran, the administration would continue to back its regional allies against Iran -- particularly Saudi Arabia, which was in the middle of a bombing campaign against the Houthis in Yemen that Saudi officials said was necessary to try to restore the ousted American-backed Yemeni government.Things on the ship ""were a little more tense,"" Captain Hewlett said. ""It's a big political message for our country to send to their country.""At the time, one Pentagon official compared the decision to deploy an aircraft carrier to turn around a weapons convoy as similar to deploying a nuclear weapon to kill an ant.To the surprise of almost no one, the Iranian convoy, within two days of the arrival of the Roosevelt, turned around and headed back toward Iran.Photograph On the Flight Deck of the Carrier Theodore Roosevelt After a Mission.

U.S.-Led Strike in Syria Is Tied to Civilian Deaths:   [Foreign Desk ],,"ANTAKYA, Turkey -- An airstrike by the American-led military coalition in northern Syria this week killed eight civilians, including two women and five children, according to neighbors and relatives of the dead.The episode revived accusations by monitoring groups that the United States and its allies are not careful enough about who is killed by the air campaign against militant groups.The target of the strike, mounted late Tuesday in Atmeh, a village near the Turkish border, was a munitions factory run by an Islamist rebel group. The strike left a yawning crater strewed with mortar shells. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said 10 foreign fighters had been killed.But the explosions also caused the roofs of nearby homes to collapse, witnesses said.""My brother lost his five daughters, and I lost my wife,"" Maan Amouri said in a telephone interview from Atmeh soon after the blast, referring to his fiancée, Fatima Yassin, who was among the dead.Monitoring groups say the United States and its allies regularly underreport the civilian toll of the air campaign.The deaths in Atmeh may dent the credibility of the United States among Syria's rebel groups, when the Obama administration is trying to assemble and train an insurgent force that can grapple effectively with the extremists of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.The episode highlighted the complex social dynamics in rebel-controlled areas of Syria, where armed groups often operate in civilian communities and sometimes provide services that are sorely lacking after more than four years of war.The American-led coalition began bombing in Syria in September 2014 after the Islamic State seized large stretches of territory. Since then, the coalition has mounted 2,300 strikes in Syria, most of them against the Islamic State, but in some cases against the Nusra Front, the Syrian affiliate of Al Qaeda, or against prominent jihadist leaders.American officials say they strive to avoid civilian casualties and investigate all reports of wrongful deaths.In an email on Thursday, the United States Central Command said it had received reports of 31 such episodes since the air campaign began and had dismissed 17 of them as not credible. Six episodes are currently being investigated, the command said.The command has released its findings concerning two of the 31 reports. One was found not credible. The other was investigated for more than six months and led to a conclusion that two children had probably been killed wrongfully by a coalition airstrike.Monitoring groups say that the command's figures are a gross understatement and that coalition strikes aimed at militants have taken a much higher toll.""They do not hit civilians because they are civilians,"" said Ossama Suleiman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks the conflict from Britain through contacts in Syria. ""They have info that makes them think they are hitting ISIS, but sometimes they kill civilians.""By his organization's reckoning, 181 civilians have died because of coalition strikes, including eight in Atmeh. Other groups have reported higher estimates.The deadliest case reported by the observatory happened in the village of Bir Mahle on May 1, where an airstrike was said to have killed more than 60 people, including dozens of women and children.A coalition representative said in an email that the coalition did not cause civilian casualties in this case ""based on the best available evidence.""Other strikes have killed civilians living or working near facilities used by the Islamic State or the Nusra Front, Mr. Suleiman said, including militant hide-outs, grain silos, oil facilities and fuel depots. At least one strike that killed a militant also killed his wife and children.Analysts caution that documenting death tolls poses challenges, especially in a place like Syria, where the war's brutality and the spread of extremist groups make it difficult or impossible for journalists and independent monitors to visit the sites of attacks or contact witnesses.Moreover, local residents sometimes exaggerate the number of victims or conceal the presence of foreign fighters in the area.""Some of the reports of fatalities caused by the U.S. have proven to be inaccurate, so I would treat the reports with a good deal of skepticism,"" said Lama Fakih, senior crisis adviser at Amnesty International.Ms. Fakih said that coalition strikes tend to hit their targets accurately, but that some have nonetheless killed civilians who were near the military targets. She called on the coalition to make more information available about how it selects targets and weighs their military importance against the risk to civilians. When civilians are harmed, she said, the coalition should make sure that they or their families receive compensation.The strike in Atmeh on Tuesday illustrated the close ties between rebels and civilians.The strike destroyed a weapons workshop that belonged to a group called the Sunna Army, part of an Islamist coalition that includes the Nusra Front and is fighting the forces of Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad. Civilian homes were close to the workshop, on land owned by Mustafa Amouri, who was known earlier in the uprising for offering hospitality to aid workers and journalists who entered Syria clandestinely from Turkey. Reporters for The New York Times met his family a number of times.As Syria's conflict escalated from a popular uprising to a civil war, jihadists came to greatly outnumber journalists among the people reaching Atmeh from Turkey, and the Amouri family built ties with Islamist groups who were smuggling fighters and supplies through the village.Musab Kadour, who lives nearby, said Mr. Amouri rented land to the Sunna Army to build the workshop. One of Mr. Amouri's sons, Muawiya, lived near the factory, and five of his daughters were killed when the blast collapsed the roof of his house, Mr. Kadour said. He added that they ranged in age from 4 to 10. He provided photos of the dead children taken before they were buried.A family that had fled fighting farther south in Syria was also killed: Qutaifa Yassin; her son, Yousif; and her daughter Fatima, who was engaged to Maan Amouri.The United States Central Command confirmed in an email message that the coalition had conducted an airstrike in the area of Atmeh, but did not specify the target. It said it was looking into reports of civilian casualties there.",1.0
World Briefing | Asia; North Korea: Dispute Over Land Mines:   [Foreign Desk ],,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea denied on Friday planting land mines that maimed two South Korean soldiers near their guard post last week.Three land mines that the South said were manufactured by North Korea exploded on Aug. 4 when the two soldiers stepped on them just outside their post inside the South Korean half of the 2.5-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone, a buffer separating large contingents of the two countries' armies. One soldier lost both legs and the other one leg in the blasts.On Monday, the South and the American-led United Nations Command said a joint investigation had concluded that the mines had been planted by North Korean troops. As evidence, they presented the debris of wooden-box land mines used by the North Korean military.On Friday, the North called those findings ""nonsense"" and accused South Korea of using stray North Korean mines it had collected from the buffer zone to fabricate the incident in an attempt to drive up military tension. It challenged the South to provide more persuasive evidence, such as video footage, that the mines had been planted by North Korea.""If the same mines had exploded in the heart of Seoul, are they still going to insist that our troops went and planted them there?"" a North Korean spokesman was quoted as saying by the North's official Korean Central News Agency.The South Korean military said Friday that the North's military had sent a similar denial across the border by telephone. The South, as it had earlier, vowed ""severe retaliation.""The mine explosions worsened already chilly relations between the two Koreas.As part of its initial response, the South turned on its battery of loudspeakers on the border with the North for the first time in 11 years, blaring propaganda broadcasts that included harsh criticism of the North Korean government. On Friday, activists in the South released balloons carrying propaganda leaflets across the border. The balloons also carried a large banner that called the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, ""a bloodthirsty murderer"" and ""human trash.""For its part, state-run television in the North this week showed North Korean soldiers shooting at an image of the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, with pistols and rifles. The North also warned that it was ready to attack the White House in Washington and the Blue House, the presidential office in Seoul, saying that a joint South Korean-American military exercise scheduled to begin next week was bringing the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
"Despite Truce, Shelling Continues in Parts of Ukraine:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"LUHANSKOYE, Ukraine -- The first day of a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine was marred by deadly artillery fire on Sunday, and both the Ukrainian military and Russian-backed separatists accused each other of violating the new accord.Some lingering violence was expected, given the recent intensity of the combat, yet over all, Ukrainian officials said, the accord reached last week was holding.A lull after the midnight cease-fire deadline, however, was followed Sunday morning by a resumption of shelling near the disputed town of Debaltseve, where the fate of about 8,000 Ukrainian soldiers remained unresolved in the negotiations leading to the cease-fire.By midday, shells and rockets were flying in both directions over the front line about nine miles north of the besieged town.The separatists had violated the cease-fire 10 times at various locations, a Ukrainian military spokesman, Anatoliy Stelmakh, said in a statement on Sunday. A local official said two people had died in shelling.The separatists said the Ukrainian Army had opened fire and their forces had little choice but to respond, a rebel news agency, DAN, quoted Eduard Basurin, the military spokesman for the Donetsk People's Republic, as saying. ""Units were forced to open fire in response,"" Mr. Basurin said.The clashes focused, as they have for weeks, on Ukraine's fragile, attenuated and possibly severed supply route into Debaltseve.A rebel leader had warned on Saturday that the accord would not apply to that area, if the Ukrainian Army tried to break out of what he said was an encirclement. The Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, has denied that Debaltseve is surrounded.The argument hinges on one section of road stretching about nine miles from this village, Luhanskoye, into Debaltseve. It is heavily mined and within range of both armies' artillery, meaning that neither side can travel it and that neither the separatists nor Kiev can claim undisputed control over it. If Ukraine cannot evacuate or resupply the thousands of soldiers there, the casualties, from artillery barrages, and the eventual surrender of the survivors, could tip the outcome of the war, and quite likely destabilize Ukrainian domestic politics. Mr. Poroshenko has said he may ask Parliament to declare martial law.A dozen or so soldiers, filthy, bearded and wide-eyed, turned up on Sunday at a hospital in Ukrainian-held territory after escaping from the town. They said that comrades in another truck had been blown up by a separatist missile.They were the first known people to have left Debaltseve since Thursday, though their exit seemed to shed no light on the dispute over the openness of the road.After unloading three wounded colleagues and a body, one of the soldiers, who offered only his first name, Viktor, slumped in a hospital corridor and said, ""We got out only because we were lucky.""Soldiers on the supply route have said for days that it was impassable, contrary to the senior leadership's claims. From the last Ukrainian checkpoint here in Luhanskoye, the road stretched off into the mist Sunday morning, cratered and vacant, with nothing moving in either direction. ""You should leave here as quickly as you can,"" a twitchy Ukrainian soldier said. ""This road is closed.""Kommersant, an influential Russian newspaper, reported over the weekend that eight of the 16 hours of cease-fire talks involving the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine in Minsk, Belarus, last week circled around the fate of Debaltseve.""Almost half of the time was spent discussing the Debaltseve kettle,"" wrote the newspaper's Kremlin reporter, Andrey Kolesnikov, using the Russian term for a military encirclement.""Above all, does it exist or not?"" he wrote. ""Vladimir Putin insisted that it exists and that if a cease-fire agreement is reached, it will be odd if it isn't violated: Those in the kettle will certainly try to get out of there; those who have boiled that kettle will try to collect the foam.""Over the weekend, President Obama spoke by telephone with Mr. Poroshenko and expressed ""grave concern"" about the Debaltseve problem. Mr. Obama also spoke with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.President François Hollande of France and Ms. Merkel also spoke by phone to Mr. Poroshenko and the Russian president, Mr. Putin, about the truce, according to a statement issued by Mr. Hollande's office.On the first day of the cease-fire, many people began stirring from bunkers and basements and assessing the damage.In Luhanskoye, soldiers stood outside, smoking against a backdrop of destruction -- discarded ammunition boxes, broken tree limbs and shattered glass. Not a single house had its windows intact.Illustrating how poorly the army was equipped, one soldier was using the lull to repair a battery for his armored personnel carrier, saying he had no spare.Kneeling in a muddy street, he melted a piece of plastic with a cigarette lighter and allowed the blobs to plug a leak in the wall of the battery.A lone pedestrian picked his way through craters on a street, carrying a bag of bread that he said he would feed to his chickens that had not been cared for since Thursday. He was not sure how many had made it. ""It's not a big deal,"" he said. ""But I do want to keep them.""Despite the continued shelling, some residents in these front-line villages said they were focused on the benefits the deal had already brought.Aleksei V. Kravchenko, 73, a retiree in Svitlodarsk, watched plumbers repair a water pipe burst in an artillery strike on Saturday, before the cease-fire took effect.He said he wanted to thank Ms. Merkel for negotiating the truce, despite its limitations, on behalf of his grandchildren. Mr. Kravchenko had built a bomb shelter in his basement and had spent nights with the children during the shelling.""They would say, 'Grandpa, I don't want to die young,' and I held them, and they were shaking, and I looked in their eyes, and they were afraid,"" he said. ""Now we are hoping.""Photograph Ukrainian Soldiers Playing Sunday On a Road in Svitlodarsk, Approaching the Disputed Town of Debaltseve. Shelling Resumed in Some Areas Sunday.

"Agreement Calls for Release of Pilot Held in Moscow, Ukrainian President Says:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"MOSCOW -- Of the hundreds of prisoners of war captured during the nearly yearlong fighting in eastern Ukraine, only one was mentioned by name on the agenda of world leaders at peace talks in Minsk, Belarus: Nadiya V. Savchenko, a former lieutenant in the Ukrainian military, helicopter navigator and graduate of Ukraine's Air Force Academy.Ms. Savchenko, 33, is not being held in eastern Ukraine by Russian-backed separatists. She is in a Moscow prison, charged by Russia in connection with the deaths of two Russian journalists who were killed in a mortar strike in Ukraine in June while covering a war that the Kremlin has long insisted does not involve Russia or its military.As the leaders in Minsk announced on Thursday that they had reached a broad agreement for a cease-fire and weapons pullback in eastern Ukraine, there was also a proviso for Ms. Savchenko's release. President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine, for whom winning the pilot's freedom had become a priority, announced the condition at a news conference and said there was an understanding that she would be freed.How Ms. Savchenko ended up in a Russian jail, facing charges by the Investigative Committee, the main national criminal investigations agency in Russia, is disputed.When she first surfaced in Russia, she was being held at a prison in Voronezh, near the Ukrainian border. Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Investigative Committee, claimed she had crossed voluntarily into Russia.""It turned out that she crossed the Russian border without documents, posing as a refugee,"" Mr. Markin said. He added that Ms. Savchenko had been detained during a routine check of documents by the authorities.The Ukrainian government said, however, that Ms. Savchenko had been captured by rebel forces and transported to Russia.Nikolai Polozov, one of Ms. Savchenko's lawyers, said that his client had participated in the protests in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, last year that ousted the country's president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, and that she had helped carry medicine to protesters wounded by gunfire.As war broke out in eastern Ukraine, Ms. Savchenko took leave several times from the army to travel to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Mr. Polozov said. On the morning the two Russian journalists were killed, Mr. Polozov said, Ms. Savchenko was wounded in an artillery fight nearby, and she and several others were captured. He said cellphone records proved that she was caught at least 30 minutes before the mortar fire that killed the journalists.He said Ms. Savchenko had been held for two weeks in a gymnasium in Luhansk before being taken across the border and turned over to the Russian authorities.Even before the war, Ms. Savchenko was a national hero for being one of Ukraine's first female combat pilots, and was the subject of a documentary. She had combat experience in Iraq, where she served as a paratrooper with a Ukrainian contingent supporting the American-led war effort, and used that experience to pressure the Ukrainian military into admitting her to the Ivan Kozhedub Air Force University in Kharkiv for pilot training.She has been similarly steel-willed in prison. She has been on a hunger strike in recent weeks and has repeatedly castigated the Russian government for her detention, at times insisting on speaking only Ukrainian in court.At one hearing, she used a speaking opportunity to address the television cameras more than the judge. ""I'm tired of Russia's lies, your deceitful judges and your dishonest media,"" she said.Since her detention, she has been elected to the Ukrainian Parliament as a member of the Fatherland party, led by former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko. Last month, other lawmakers from the party wore T-shirts in Parliament that read, ""Free Nadiya Savchenko.""As a result of the cease-fire agreement in Minsk, it seems that they might get their wish. Mr. Poroshenko said at the news conference that there was a provision for all prisoners of war to be set free.Aleksei K. Pushkov, a prominent Russian lawmaker, cautioned that Ms. Savchenko's release was not a foregone conclusion.""There is no automatic mechanism to free a person accused of being accomplice to murder, in this case of a Russian journalist,"" Mr. Pushkov said, Russian news agencies reported.As of Thursday afternoon, there was no indication of Ms. Savchenko's release, Mark Feygin, another lawyer for Ms. Savchenko, said by telephone. ""As long as Putin or someone trusted by him does not confirm this information, we can only speak about it theoretically,"" he said.Photograph Nadiya V. Savchenko at a Moscow Court On Tuesday.

Indian and Pakistani Guards Trade Fire on Disputed Border:   [Foreign Desk ],,"NEW DELHI -- Indian and Pakistani border guards exchanged fire along the disputed northern border in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, leaving at least two people dead and at least one other wounded, officials said Saturday.Each side accused the other of breaking a cease-fire.A Pakistani military official said a 13-year-old girl had been killed by ""unprovoked firing"" from Indian border posts near the city of Sialkot. An 8-year-old was wounded in another district, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in accordance with protocol.Indian officials said Pakistani rangers ""kept on firing the whole night,"" using mortars and machine guns against 15 posts manned by India's Border Security Force.One woman was killed in the Samba district, said Rakesh Sharma, chief of the Indian forces in the Jammu region.Mr. Sharma said that the exchange of fire had been lighter during the day on Saturday, ""an odd shell left and right,"" but that residents were beginning to leave their homes in anticipation of heavier nighttime firing.Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir, and the neighbors have fought two wars over the region.For years, cross-border exchanges of fire have occasionally erupted, but in recent months, episodes of heavier shelling have prompted thousands of families in villages near the border to flee in search of safety.",1.0
"India: Pakistani Boat Explodes When Stopped at Sea, Officials Say:   [Foreign Desk ]",,"NEW DELHI -- India said on Friday that its coast guard had intercepted a suspicious Pakistan-based fishing boat at sea late on New Year's Eve, but that when Indian officers approached the vessel to investigate, four men aboard the boat set off an ""explosion and major fire"" that completely destroyed the vessel.Pakistani officials said they believed that the Indian report was a hoax, though they were still trying to investigate the matter.The Indian Defense Ministry said security forces had received repeated warnings of a ""threat from the sea,"" and had increased their maritime patrols in recent months. The ministry said that Indian officials received intelligence on Wednesday night that a fishing boat ""was planning some illicit transaction in the Arabian Sea.""A coast guard patrol ship located the vessel around midnight and attempted to stop it from fleeing by firing warning shots, the Defense Ministry said in a statement.Four men who were seen aboard the vessel refused to cooperate, and then ""hid themselves in a below-deck compartment and set the boat on fire,"" the statement said. The boat burned and sank in the early hours of New Year's Day, and darkness and strong winds prevented the coast guard vessel from recovering its remains, the statement said.Indian officials did not say what they thought the four men's intentions were.Terrorists have entered India by sea in the past. The heavily armed gunmen who mounted coordinated attacks in Mumbai in 2008, which left 166 people dead including six Americans, traveled by boat from Pakistan.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",1.0
